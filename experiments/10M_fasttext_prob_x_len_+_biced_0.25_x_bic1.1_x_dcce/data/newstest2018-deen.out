Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards to change your view of the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt where young people are met today .
&quot; a pit chapel , where now for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the one @-@ sty reasons of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it &apos;s annoying when the maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; that knows everyone who had already dreamed about , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i instead of a green meadow instead of a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; the historical map of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bayern of the State Government , are all but up to date - but that is why it is very conclu@@ sive . &quot;
especially when you compar@@ es them with current online cards .
&quot; it will become clear , as cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of Munich &apos;s Mercury have changed since the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; the digital Bavaria at@@ las is a pat@@ ch@@ work of pat@@ ch@@ work , which you see as such . &quot;
&quot; the big super@@ visor were involved for cities and communities for detailed maps , so @-@ called judg@@ ments . &quot;
this arose according to the details of the Bav@@ arian surve@@ ying management between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and skip the first Ver@@ messung .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second War of War with Austria .
Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave an top@@ ographic recording of Bay@@ erns - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops went on with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 , the European neighbors , who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria @-@ card . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max . Joseph drove the project ahead , and founded the &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Observ@@ atory management . &quot;
the judgment sheet for Munich comes from the year 18@@ 56 and is as all other to find on the website of the Bav@@ arian National Library .
the comparison morning / Today is the example of the state capital at the most impressive .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
&quot; Send@@ ling became 21 years after the creation of the map , thus 1877 , as the Munich city district . &quot;
&quot; today , the sen@@ d@@ ling lies in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings focus at 18@@ 56 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the rebellion of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : at Hin@@ ein@@ zo@@ oming a small card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ in numbered numbers from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ ge &quot; , &quot; which was derived from the basic tax . &quot;
&quot; today , small par@@ c@@ els do not occupy more - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green area is characterised by the north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 sw@@ ings of the October Revolution , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the judgment sheet one reads in the area of today &apos;s district A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , not only the road @-@ name &quot; &quot; at Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; or from the hill &quot; On the ventilation &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse , once a person comes with madness . &quot;
&quot; there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ chner district of the Ir@@ ren@@ aissance &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard headed by Gu@@ dden - that psychiat@@ rist was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time , and for example , he ended the chains of Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; he is also forbidden to use the personnel to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museums of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients had been at first place , later it was extended to 500 places . &quot;
at some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905 .
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ East is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ry psychiat@@ r@@ ists . &quot;
at the eighth of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt the young people in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um meet .
&quot; the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 , and walked in a youth @-@ home with training establishments . &quot;
&quot; west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich east , east residential buildings dating from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children @-@ house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; was built in an architectural drawing on the country of origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ cy , which had been destroyed during the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was recorded at 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the merchant &apos;s road was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the second world war even in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies were in December 1944 a lot of holes in the city center .
a large stayed until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business buildings and a greeting chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days were the preliminary work and will take place on 5 April 2017 for the second S @-@ Bahn platform . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ ders , the old Munich @-@ card can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof . &quot;
civil Rights Group posted travel insurance for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the promotion of colored colored has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i &apos;s discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board for the Federal State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , who wish to enter into force until 28 August 2017 , since a series of frag@@ mented , non @-@ based incidents in the whole state will occur and here , it is said in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law from Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder to gain discrimination , as well as the enforcement authorities of the state , dis@@ proportionate dis@@ proportionate to minorities , prompted the group to make the travel warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said . &quot;
&quot; they have injury of civil rights , which people happen . &quot;
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are be@@ aten or killed , &quot; &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency which we have not yet heard .
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group ass@@ aul@@ ted incidents like racial clas@@ hes against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no gasoline any more , and was taken by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i in custody without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also pointed out a recent report by the Office of the General @-@ General @-@ State Office of Mis@@ sour@@ i , where black motor@@ ists in the state will be 75 percent more common than White . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of and inform their families , friends and collaborators who could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be willing to bring if it could be Cau@@ tion or their relatives have to travel through the state .
Mis@@ sour@@ i signed 100 hate speech in 2015 following the latest figures from the hate @-@ back programme of F@@ BI - which include the state in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it harder to complain a company for housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil liberties had published ( AC@@ L@@ U ) travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the States of immigration laws had adopted , the local law enforcement authorities have committed to ver@@ ish people because of immigration violations , which will help the AC@@ L@@ U to further pro@@ vision@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are generally issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries , but in recent times , stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
ordination project is elementary
the Fis@@ cal Wei@@ fence @-@ Project is a success project and continues to continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Parliam@@ entary MPs Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have gotten a picture on site .
&quot; at the Ar@@ wen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fis@@ wen@@ de@@ mann family met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two representatives . &quot;
&quot; Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann granted some insights into his farm , in which it houses 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 mil@@ kis@@ ses and also many young animals and houses in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Black @-@ milk &quot; &quot; is for him of an alternative mark@@ eter path for the milk of its cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este comes exclusively region@@ ally .
&quot; as he is also known as BL@@ H@@ V @-@ Chairman of Fis@@ her@@ bach , it is important for the &quot; &quot; elementary project &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I can not manage on such steep surfaces .
&quot; the green area for a lot of work , much has to be processed with the engine sense . &quot;
&quot; we have here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; stressed Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the el@@ ter@@ ous operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zers , even if it is not bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the ordination project and is happy about the Leader . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hect@@ are , farmers must be supported . &quot;
&quot; one hope that the for@@ estation of the areas could be drawn up yet another while . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continued their operation , &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot;
farmers are often in criticism because of promoting often in criticism
a total of 25 plots from eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
&quot; the disclosure area is therefore 40 hectares , which can not be affor@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; of the total cost of 71 500 Euro , half of the population was funded , a quarter carried out the municipality of fisher@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the farmers left 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of course fence . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the longevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and women &apos;s women . &quot;
&quot; even for Peter Weiss stood firm , &quot; &quot; Here are the best food produced . &quot;
the maternity @-@ law ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state promotion of past@@ ure @-@ fence .
objective is the disclosure of the Schwar@@ zw@@ alds .
prerequ@@ isites is the presence of one of the L@@ PR named conve@@ y@@ isse .
&quot; in addition , the temporary surface must not be less heavy ( Hang@@ ing over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the fisher@@ y Wei@@ bel project 2018 , the motion of eight participants are currently running with 24 kilometers of fence , which would like to build up just 16 kilometres fence . &quot;
&quot; the open space corresponds to 35 hectares , the Calabri@@ an costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the safest sign of a regime changes is when they begin to att@@ aching the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at Fir@@ dos Square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ash in a h@@ it@@ ty dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the proposals of Presidents to dras@@ tic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller does not hold the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of land@@ owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have w@@ rest@@ ling him if he had done it .
&quot; but he laid hold of its importance , and in particular the meaning that you have been written when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta sh@@ aded : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go down here for a full thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illum@@ ines the world . &quot;
the poem which you refer to is later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is correct properly , but as it beha@@ ves itself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about contemporary resonance on the asc@@ ending words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state invites not just any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; &quot; your exhausted masses , who desire for it , free to breathe free , the miserable waste of your wealthy coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; miserable waste &quot; was better viewed on our screens .
Miller has not been committed in literary criticism - he clearly did that these people in Tr@@ umps USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute : it is indeed a conflict about the significance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who settled for it to place their words after her death on the basis - were very good that they have taken a high political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by placing the feminine em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice .
and she gives herself another name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminine cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and exactly how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people wanted to change from the right wing this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great cry as Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not one , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative is that the American flame is moving into the converted world : &quot; Lady Liberty is proceeding . &quot;
it shall bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States .
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something hit .
the importance of the statue is quite and certainly a question of the standpoint of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative action of Lazarus consisted in them to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , but hopeless people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the true sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome they have to hear .
&quot; of course , this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever recognise . &quot;
&quot; their tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way but the hatred , who is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championships 2017 : Neil Black lo@@ oms Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle remembers a time when only two shots belonged to the UK team
&quot; the power Director of the Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member states of the World Championships &quot; will contribute a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday . &quot;
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; developed in Scotland some special &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find it , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which can compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 ft route , while em@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was chosen by the crew to the team @-@ kap@@ sel . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is quite modest .
&quot; her captain &apos;s speech was amazing , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were ch@@ ot@@ tish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ ie brought quite naturally , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth @-@ Silver medal winner , which will compete in their fifth World Championships during the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 g@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven that were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid@@ stre@@ w Mu@@ ir leads on this road and has five UK and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m run , is another Scot@@ sman , which one should observe the victory in the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle remembers its first World Championships as the only other Sch@@ otte in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell was .
&quot; Mann@@ ing Chap@@ ters says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots do not only belong to the team , but in some cases even with the medals and at the Fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing to be on the team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honor anyway but to know that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chosen to do something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the vill@@ i that belong to the team . &quot;
it shows only how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to rise on po@@ is@@ dies . &quot;
what my speech is concerned as a chapter ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
&quot; I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home world championship . &quot;
&quot; so it is really important to put on this home support and profit from it , that we are back at the Olympiastadion . &quot;
&quot; I get a second chance to go down there and compete , and it simply will be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
&quot; blocking critic on Facebook : don &apos;t throw you to a public office , if you cannot tolerate the freezing of voters &quot;
the father of our country knew something of poor press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers led him because of everything , from domestic policy to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he sh@@ utt@@ led in criticism , safely . &quot;
but he did not have his critics to be sil@@ enced .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; &quot; The freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid , and mu@@ te , we become as the sheep to slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Governor General Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work on it to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Society compl@@ ained him therefore at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the rod of the governor left the law@@ suit as free@@ vo@@ l , and the online comment was full of a counter@@ reaction with &quot; Well , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like stool .
&quot; this is an Republi@@ can Governor in a overwhelming democratic state , which is amazing . &quot;
he has the two @-@ highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary Hit@@ z@@ head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles . &quot;
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect to his voters and to debate his ha@@ il@@ ess head after chemotherapy .
&quot; therefore , the block@@ age of persons who come to the side of the Governor - which is a public forum that is officially designated as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax @-@ Dollars - need@@ less and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ w@@ Spre@@ cher@@ in Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the acts of the governor and argued that the block@@ age of comments is nothing more than a moderation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of tro@@ lls or sp@@ itting or h@@ ectic people , who reson@@ ate online the whi@@ p . &quot;
the post spoke with some of the real people that were blocked by Ho@@ gan@@ ese .
&quot; and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no tro@@ lls . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments are respectful , thoughtful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the priest brought the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic Faith .
&quot; lawyer . Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ ted but she asked for hate speech . &quot;
&quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate speech and gave other current news , she wrote in the commentary box of the news posting &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea when a number of people takes place on the same subject , then they are mis@@ respected by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the members of the governor referred to as &quot; concentrated spam attack , &quot; others would probably be called &quot; &quot; inter@@ ce@@ de &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era is easy to cut a message by simply blocked a critic or deleted a negative comment .
&quot; it is much clean@@ er than in previous time , if you had done the same that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical lad@@ ders and to burn or burn prot@@ esters . &quot;
but that is exactly what is happening digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public officials who critic@@ ises it with Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is em@@ ailed by Twitter @-@ users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County last the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to the U.S. district of James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she appointed a vot@@ er of her Facebook page . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be that hard .
&quot; at the time of Washington , Washington had a similar effect at the time of the affordable port . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lies between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous correspondence stroke on his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
&quot; the people who used pseudon@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers , which made Washington decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , who critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and navigation with the United Kingdom of critici@@ zed his office , according to historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he has not been sil@@ enced .
&quot; freedom of speech , opinion of dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true guidance means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty is hoping for the next three days of domestic comfort , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosted the 25th edition of Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , which lost last year next door in the Ar@@ cher@@ field Links to the final , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is acting as a tournament message on behalf of the Club &apos;s green@@ ders and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best , he is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry made a great job than he put on this place .
he is a eager fi@@ ery of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career both at the European tour and the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels particularly &quot; , &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I have not able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open because it was in year after I had won it , taken out of the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
Gary Or@@ r who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year .
this event will be his first pri@@ me@@ tic appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I am glad how it has gone .
&quot; with the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ faculty . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six shots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ All@@ ister , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; the entrance is free , the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with a in@@ mates and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive one @-@ smoking
over the past two decades fewer people died of lung cancer due to passive cancer .
&quot; at this result , scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) results in a study . &quot;
&quot; according to our estimates , per year 16@@ 7 lung cancer is attribut@@ able to passive exposure , &quot; said Doc@@ tor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , he went to a study on this subject of 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there have been 400 lung cancer due to passive pas@@ sions per year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
home@@ closures prove to be very complex
&quot; construction works in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and , &quot; &quot; somewhat more so in time , &quot; &quot; says the director of the court Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;

when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i cooks the dinner she uses no stove .
it can be used even rarely a pot .
&quot; in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ ent@@ age in the un@@ quiet in@@ dones@@ ian province Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the bon@@ ded tu@@ ber is taken with di@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed up . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay - she has no furniture , where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;

poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , too late can be too dangerous : most village men are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody w@@ ager it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life of the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , than 1,0@@ 26 elders by a public h@@ ander@@ ing in the occupation of occupation . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement that stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch rule , turned out quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observed . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , being part of the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea &apos;s eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is ö@@ de is . the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there are no public transportation .
&quot; the town with about 19@@ .000 inhabitants is composed of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ boo colored , and from cor@@ ru@@ pul@@ ses that were transformed by r@@ ust into various yellow @-@ brown sounds . &quot;

&quot; earlier we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is the poorest province where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant mortality and alphabe@@ ti@@ fications in Asia .
but it is also In@@ don@@ esi@@ ens Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine of the world , grass mountain , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high land provincial provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port is built in the value of 3,@@ 1 billion US dollars gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has a total of estimated 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; these riches are however a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , which make sure that &apos;s empower@@ ing military is a sti@@ cking presence . &quot;
&quot; a study of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port local military associations and units between 1998 and 2004 paid nearly 20 million US dollars , including up to 15@@ 0.000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
pap@@ u@@ lian demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden G@@ ans and are treated mer@@ c@@ ingly .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 pap@@ ua had been killed and thousands have been tor@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indones@@ ian military . &quot;
mass@@ aging in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal groups in 1970 @-@ 20 years were elected to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police had more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; we lose all , &quot; it is said in a report of the Arch@@ diocese Bris@@ bane taken from 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year include , such as un@@ lawful exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electro@@ des are especially popular after another report - and the brutal decline of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as each week happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
screws have reinforced that Pap@@ u@@ as resources have an influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing , since Muslim economies originate from the populated islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;

&quot; the Indones@@ ian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known at the People &apos;s and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke during his election campaign in 2014 the inequalities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; the former carp@@ enter 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with anticip@@ ation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October . &quot;
on 7 December 2014 a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali as two Indones@@ ian soldiers on a motorcycle through the dark .
the ro@@ cking children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took an impetus to her tone , and came back with four soldiers later , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , drank and smote the group with their gun , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers got into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so heavily be@@ aten that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government Commission was set in fire and the things are escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; approximately 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves together on a football field before the local police station and the Military Commander @-@ Centre to demand justice . &quot;
they bore cerem@@ onial Jag@@ db@@ ers and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and a bird @-@ ges@@ ic mim@@ ic - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some prot@@ esters began to drag stones at police and military post .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent out by an internal radio : &quot; if the masses make more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which has not been released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ emi@@ as Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ pping danger and called for rest and urged the amount to return home . &quot;
no one was to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly turned into my lin@@ kes wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his multic@@ ol@@ oured wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the here gathered soldiers . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and studied his body to make sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who has only one name , the TI@@ ME in dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the che@@ ek spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Re@@ porters , that his officers just wanted to &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; because they are attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings appeared only at the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i kept a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and s@@ wor@@ e the historical mis@@ ings in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case immediately resolved , so that in the future it will no longer happen &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , security Minister Wir@@ anto was told in October 2016 that he establishes a court mechanism for breaking historical violations of human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries are long ago performed .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed to approach these violations , but there are processes that must go through . &quot;
then we did a retreat when he talked to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with TI@@ ME and said he didn &apos;t have any plans to set up a complaint mechanism .
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wir@@ anto , charged the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , said more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody Independent Declaration of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua had already been enclosed , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were contrary to such allegations with gri@@ ev@@ ous madness .
&quot; I was interviewed during the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he is still living in fear later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , have fear being shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai will be afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was be@@ aten by the military after he helped to bury four victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the army sought after me , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
the s@@ late did not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police on villagers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between the villagers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring a unconscious man to hospital died a person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ wned when he was fishing in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
rising villagers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location office .
&quot; the police said that the villagers threw stones at officers , who reacted there@@ on by fire @-@ nuts . &quot;
but natives say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot a lot and a killing .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witness , as the injured here were delivered quickly , so TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called to hold the officers and to hold the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an accident of the Indones@@ ian government .
&quot; the lack of sensible development strengthens the dis@@ content of the corresponding Me@@ e , mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , which live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many of them joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the Reb@@ els army , which claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by stro@@ lling around spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ den Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to these years , thousands of people were arrested in panic and imprisoned in custody in recent years , under the pretext of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some have never dive again .
&quot; among the people of Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai as a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dissatisfaction .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for local people . &quot;
bread is just out of reach .
the people here build everything they eat : above all not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they reserve the majority of harvesting for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of not@@ ched only 10,000 in@@ dones@@ ian R@@ up@@ ies ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
&quot; over time , economic inequalities have grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants that have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs that exist in the region , usually go to the better educated and wealthy of their migrants . &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own business competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions of the coverage of international media remain tense . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ es and Basi@@ cs Long@@ cham@@ p were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is electoral campaign , the limitations of coverage up@@ lift to promote transparency and development , is not realised . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report by In@@ don@@ ate &apos;s un@@ troubled provinces from Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua . visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
the lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six Pacific States - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ine and the Sal@@ om@@ onen Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sho@@ ß@@ erei . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supporting the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r pointed out the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there is free media so that it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
people on site want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , conducted under the direction of human right @-@ amb@@ ass@@ adors Ke@@ es Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , silence their silence and sup@@ pressed him &quot; We want freedom &quot; , &quot; according to a source that also wants to remain at the meeting , but remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election , but Pap@@ ua said that they will probably not vote again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai committees , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is based in impover@@ ished educ@@ ative and healthcare services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , have seen their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; that he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they only want justice , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and intimi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ ation led a last symbolic act of Des@@ p@@ ation : the body of a victim was buried on a premises just opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know they might never come to justice , but at least they don &apos;t have the responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; one member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a narrow head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scr@@ aper from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai in his lo@@ book and forced hundreds of inhabitants , from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ story building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that is swe@@ pt in only two years by the high @-@ house , which is called random the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we are standing with the fire@@ works and scre@@ ams of the people .
&quot; we burned down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor to the bottom , &quot; &quot; told a resident named his name as George ang@@ ab , Re@@ uters . &quot;
&quot; Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 hours GMT ) , the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cool@@ ed . &quot;
the government said they work on the provision of accommodations for those affected .
&quot; the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials , which are used in areas of skyscrapers around the world . &quot;
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in the year 2015 revealed that the largest portion of the damages from the cl@@ adding , the out@@ clothing for decoration or insulation , came . &quot;
&quot; in the UK , the police said , they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding to the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a Bran@@ des where about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis association ( IT@@ F ) is organised with its large Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the support for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single is only supported on two pay@@ outs , Hau@@ ch@@ thin is not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but even so much appreciated five @-@ set classics remain the tradition so much . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only delayed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change in order to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; Hag@@ ger@@ ty said . &quot;
you will continue to work on improving your competitors .
&quot; at all , not only during the vote was before the proposal made the proposal to make the finals at a neutral place . &quot;
new from 2018 are just compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists will have in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in future in the first round the host right .
&quot; to reduce the costs of the organis@@ ers , the requirements are facilitated in training courses , etc . and players will have to pass under the Davis Cup fewer official media dates before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 of 5 US travelers will bring bot@@ tled items to the aircraft , find out a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey among passengers found that more than 20 percent become aware of or un@@ consciously dis@@ missed items in the check@@ points of U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent that occurred the aircraft , while they were accidentally toler@@ ated kni@@ ves or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed , they had not been delayed that they mistak@@ enly have traveled with bul@@ lets , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey with more than 1,000 people - provided by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also determined that younger travellers rather observe the rules . &quot;
&quot; from the respon@@ dents , the en@@ cor@@ es that they kno@@ w@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , were 19,@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were . &quot;
the most common items that have been ab@@ err@@ ated at T@@ SA agents were both foods and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 percent gave to know wis@@ ely articles carried by blade by the safety control , whereas 2,@@ 2 percent of the female genital respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had been inten@@ tionally brought to the airplane . &quot;
&quot; the company said , I asked travelers in the whole country to find out how many accidentally smug@@ gling were brought through the airport security and how many things could have done . &quot;
&quot; it is not a surprise that people who are most often smug@@ gling - kno@@ w@@ ingly or un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly - because of the safety wear ones who were most often flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing . &quot;
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take or how much of it .
so it is not a surprise that the largest amount of liquids conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA &apos;s conf@@ is@@ cated objects .
&quot; a time long thought the people , the T@@ SA could watch books as smug@@ glers . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la Custom@@ ers cancel order
&quot; electro @-@ thou@@ sand@@ s@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k , with the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so far , he has never noticed that a part of the customer has withdrawn their un@@ binding reservation again . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the always triumph@@ s figures on sales increases , and more gigantic sales targets has Tes@@ la leader El@@ on Mus@@ k in the announcement of recent quarterly report for the first time a different , less smooth numbers reveal : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in the past few months , Mus@@ k was often applied with the more than 500,000 pre@@ orders for the new car , whose delivery starts . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k set a : from the altogether 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ orders , 6@@ 3,000 have already been withdrawn again . &quot;
critics were always pointed out that it is only about non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; during a cancellation Tes@@ la pays off the 1000 euro ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; reservation deposit &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; currently accounts for 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations in front , spatial Mus@@ k conference in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , that the cancellation of roughly twelve percent of all orders have to become a problem , however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side of production . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la 8@@ 4.000 vehicles delivered . &quot;
&quot; 2018 , all models should be assembled - 500,000 , by 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k currently per day 1800 reservations are available .
&quot; who orders a &quot; Model 3 , &quot; may be expected in the second half of 2018 with delivery - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand new , never tested in practice , without any major inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum relief . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to greater delays , then the in@@ compatibility of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company can not prevent the dis@@ satisfied customers from dav@@ elop@@ es . &quot;
EPA Chef P@@ ru@@ itt moves back to the rules of the Obama Era on reducing emissions
&quot; one day after he was compl@@ ained by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the environmental authorities , took his previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions Smo@@ g @-@ causing aviation . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as its agency proved to be the needs of the state environmental authorities as previous administrative administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit filed against his previous position in a federal government .
&quot; it is a deadline , which ran off on October 1st for states to adhere to the standards of 2015 for bot@@ tom@@ ing o@@ zone o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June , that he will delay the compliance with a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid it in local decisions , or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump prosecution of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a reliable opponent to take severe environmental regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt repe@@ ats to block the rules or delay the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden conversion from Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ itts regular @-@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Constitutional Court in Washington decided that the EPA has passed its authority , when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas company for monitoring and reducing meth@@ ane . &quot;
&quot; in a review published on Wednesday evening , I suggested that his turn@@ around in o@@ zone standards is simply the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; in former administr@@ ations , the EPA has often maintained the deadlines for implementing and then to be indicted by activ@@ ist@@ groups and others , and said in an agreement to determine the appointment time , &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt said the EPA has more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us , Ernst . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the comments of EPA have said that P@@ ru@@ itt eventually led his &quot; authority to delay and all the other legally available , &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Republi@@ can in Congress push for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
a draft law approved in the last month &apos;s draft is to delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 at least eight years .
the measure has not yet been put to the set @-@ up in the Senate .
&quot; the New York Administrator @-@ General Secretary General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of the States , who compl@@ ained the EPA in this week , said the group intended to maintain legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our chambers - is an important gain for health and the safety of these 6,@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;
&quot; new York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Iowa , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;

&quot; the standing smooth@@ y can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year will contribute to thousands of premature death cases . &quot;

&quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this rational step by the responsible person responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .

tum@@ our celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the Jubilee Church is invited to the old cemetery A@@ real in turmoil on Sunday , 16 July , at 16.@@ 30 p.m. to a Seren@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth benefit Seren@@ ade can be enchanted by this powerful place .
saving and maintaining the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors tum@@ ours to their concerns .
&quot; Walter Martin@@ i emphasized : &quot; &quot; it is a unique villages of small mar@@ od . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was mentioned for the first time in the Wur@@ ttem@@ berg Ur@@ cli@@ que : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church , including the Vo@@ g@@ tei by Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the word &quot; word &quot; according to the Ur@@ linger mountain apart from the former parish church except the one @-@ old church church , also a splendid courtyard , to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ ement was right and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Upper Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today are still visible in the town of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Berg &quot; the third , the grand settlers of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around the year 1600 under@@ pin these historical conditions .
the patent was right from the early medieval home .
&quot; a gentleman who built a church whose church built , and he occupied with a pastor , remained the owner of this church , and could also inher@@ it this own church . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the right to use a pastor or propose a new pastor . &quot;
three alt@@ ars were in the church and two bells on the tower .
the biggest of the two t@@ aps at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created Glo@@ cke was then for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows of windows were stolen and the bel@@ lies were stolen .
the roof was imper@@ me@@ able .
in 17@@ 96 French troops near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church @-@ chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
rem@@ n@@ ants of the church dro@@ wned in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery was also known as the last resting place for the dead from squ@@ in@@ ers .
18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ Church has been abandoned .
only the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ m can be stopped .
in the New Year of New Years 18@@ 34 a storm turned the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ m and the half rus@@ hed .
&quot; to prevent a hurt , the tower was interrupted . &quot;
only today &apos;s existing turbul@@ ence remained as a witness of the 750 year old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ en@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em maintain the &quot; Schaff@@ sion@@ ers &quot; as successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn the Hil@@ arius system .
&quot; as organis@@ er invite friends and sponsors tum@@ ours on Sunday , 16 July , to the sixth Seren@@ ade on the old cemetery on the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;

&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards forest , &quot; &quot; the organis@@ ers have fantastic views out . &quot;
the seren@@ ade only takes place at dry weather .
&quot; the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance to tum@@ our and listening . &quot;
the friends and sponsors tum@@ ours feel particularly obligated to the home care as Seren@@ ade @-@ Organ@@ izer Walter Martin@@ i reaffir@@ med .
society wants to check the permission of Win@@ dr@@ yers
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim dri@@ lls &quot; sees no legal conditions for the construction and therefore has turned towards the land council .
&quot; the association &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ aves &quot; &quot; has been prompted to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved since at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal has existed a wind@@ ling concentration zone .
&quot; within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are possible , at the same time , the concentrations of wind zone causes the exclusion of wind use for the rest of the urban area . &quot;
such zones should prevent an &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had a second wind@@ ling zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , a few days before , but had not approved the district government in Düsseldorf because of a form@@ atting . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planned legal requirement , the authorization of the authorization is un@@ lawful and therefore also to increase , &quot; said Christoph Br@@ ing , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; up @-@ to @-@ date state of affairs : the city council did once again decided to meet the Wind@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a permission from the District government is still under attack . &quot;
&quot; kens : &quot; &quot; this place is not legally excluded in this place for the construction of wind turbines . &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; the corresponding writing have been received during last week at the circle Vier@@ sen , &quot; stated a speaker . &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion of examining the matter .
&quot; however , it is likely that the procedure is expected to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with a view of the ongoing proceedings at the Board of Directors , the circle on Thursday did not want to express themselves in content with the reasoning of the association &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NE@@ W re , an affiliate of the NE@@ W , is planning an area at Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four than 200 metres high winds . &quot;
&quot; last year the company had been involved in which the city quad@@ rup@@ tible is involved , P@@ acht@@ s@@ lugg@@ ish with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of large volume . &quot;
&quot; with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity demand for some 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to approximately one fifth of the power consumption of all four @-@ sized households . &quot;
the NE@@ W re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sens City stood green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the county of Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor cras@@ hing together : woman dies at terr@@ aced accident
one terrible traffic accident took place on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 3@@ 33 between the precip@@ itation and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman was fatal in doing so .
two other people were easily injured .
the national road remained closed over hours .
&quot; according to police statements , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch came with their car as part of the accompanying driving with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion , the L 3@@ 33 in direction of Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za@@ s and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city center in September .
the commercial and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants of the shopping stroll into the city center .
&quot; as the chairman of the trade trial , Christian King , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend , the customers should sensi@@ tise the customers which offers their own city apart from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , domestic companies are to present themselves with their training courses . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the stores should invite the shops to the &quot; &quot; M@@ It@@ ter@@ nights &quot; &quot; shopping centre . &quot;
&quot; however , the action not only on inhabitants of the city and the nearby region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als in the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the Ak@@ tions weekend , so Christian King . &quot;
city administration and trade represent a co @-@ operation with the Chamber of Commerce and Commerce .
&quot; so that the commercial is one and the city into another stage of the &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; Ak@@ tiv @-@ Day &quot; &quot; for Brun@@ nen@@ fest Sunday , talks with all the tra@@ des@@ men and hosts in order to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the disclaimer on parking fees this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials are to be re@@ arranged anew or again . &quot;
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many natives would have lost the city center when shopping out of sight .
&quot; in the end , all of them would have to revi@@ ve the inner city - to landlords , the farms throughout the city and associations . &quot;
&quot; it was to overcome with a network the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y , which had spread partly , had king in spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , leader of the I@@ HK center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , shared with that in the nationwide third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , in the first time five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities take part . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and St@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; the day sol@@ le &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and place its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; says Stre@@ ich . &quot;
the promotion led by the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen could affect his direc@@ tional environment itself .
two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
during construction there came to a gas pole in the school building .
new other people were injured .
&quot; in a gas group in the U.S. city of Minneapolis , two people have been killed and nine others have been injured , some of them difficult . &quot;
according to the fire bri@@ ga@@ des ( local time ) was still a vulnerable in critical condition .
a man died as part of a school building in the explosion .
a first missed later was also dead born .
&quot; with the dead , it was the employees of the school . &quot;
&quot; as an accident , we suspected the authorities work on a gas line . &quot;
&quot; during the summer time , only a few people were in the building of Minne@@ ha@@ ha Academy . &quot;
Tr@@ ump continued according to spot@@ ted tran@@ scription by phone call Mexico under pressure due to payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scri@@ p@@ te by phone call between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and Le@@ aders of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tr@@ ump called on a phone with the Mexican President Enri@@ que Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to , openly tell that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. President sh@@ im@@ ed him because he had denoun@@ ced the wall publicly . tell us , he said to him , &quot; &quot; This is not you able to say to the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump launched his presidential campaign with the promise made to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and sw@@ am to pay Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first appeal with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m turn@@ out were also published and revealed a tense exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. sne@@ aker , that a trade for the US refugees who emigr@@ ated to Australia who would like to take over Australia , who would like to take him as a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the settlement of refugees in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr. St@@ un@@ ami , &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford massacre : activ@@ ist rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a Call for Justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mercury was driving through a group of viewers in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and umped on the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white rider had to reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block its way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a man middle aged woman in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous strip - took a long train at its cigarette and looked forward @-@ looking through the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; brood the man .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; cri@@ es torn between the silence , as a young black man from the passenger &apos;s seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only a post . &quot;
&quot; but if then a loop is thrown around the neck by &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all in the audience is very real si@@ gh gro@@ wers . &quot;
since 2005 the mayor &apos; Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com - and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody was ever charged with murder .
&quot; it is really unacceptable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks who helps the organization of post . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt on a story , but it is a strain on our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former congress of affairs of the State of Georgia and a lifetime of civil rights .
&quot; for him , the im@@ position serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community , that an injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want to judge , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get fairness , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot go to healing and reconciliation until we get fairness .
a judicial physician presents a beg@@ ging on the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI files , which were received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding Graf@@ it@@ ages were suspi@@ cion in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but none was ever charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been on free foot for decades , tell citizens that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made a decision taken by the Supreme Court of Justice in Georgia for the first time to vote their voice in the summer . &quot;
&quot; about the same time as the election st@@ aking according to details of the black bul@@ letin Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle - supposedly for a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ our in the city had been , that H@@ ester has slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she carried , not from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owners , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when they removed from prison , and turned into the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , around a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b by car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison , who has prepared and arranged the mor@@ de , including a F@@ BI Report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a compromise between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the mor@@ den , revealing evidence , and witnesses the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is formulated it even more subtle .
&quot; it was a electoral right @-@ massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
almost a decade of Cass@@ andra announced the annual post@@ ures of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
&quot; their representation is vivid , gri@@ pping and founded in a kind of deep racism that many believe in America is no longer exists . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to watch and look more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that that is the point . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen , because we are then confronted with its u@@ gl@@ iness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have through . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black@@ out - into a room and lu@@ sion@@ ed , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ es Co @-@ director .
&quot; he played the role of the manager clan for years , but he said , the role will never become easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to preserve this story on life , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room tested the actors D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester sh@@ outs and pus@@ hes him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , swal@@ de from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona bes@@ e@@ dert the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs on loud .
&quot; what ? ! , asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ki@@ cked . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos; n -- he &apos; said &apos; .
&quot; yet , wit@@ ched one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you only have to meet the hard &quot; &quot; R. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and the energy in space shifts the energy in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship , replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy to get this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins once again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona the N @-@ word says , he says it sharp and with rep@@ ul@@ ating . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there is cry , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; dressed with a funeral dress , stands about the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actor and guides bil@@ y Holidays &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
about one hundred meters behind it caught a group of about four dozen spectators and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost even@@ ly between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come only down the road . &quot;
&quot; they have experienced every nearly eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as , when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; up to this point the mur@@ ders have remained a anec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you found in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de takes place , the air feels soft . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the cor@@ pse . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cken at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ pering each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ mu@@ gs a little boy as if he wants to remember it . &quot;
after a few minutes you would like to thank Gre@@ ene of the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch@@ soap away and wi@@ pe their tears away .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the clan . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ cona embr@@ aces two of his fellow @-@ players and then breaks in their arms together , the emotional weight of the performance finally breaks with him . &quot;
&quot; it is okay , whis@@ pering one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did that for a reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience deals with the actors for dinner together . &quot;
&quot; ch@@ atting a table , a white couple from Atlanta excited about the post@@ ures with a black couple that they have met . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ ski was fighting to find words which left the performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you themselves and who do it , because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ chen is still going on , she added , &quot; today the only police shooting is called . &quot;
&quot; in the same room T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks Hof at his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of the civil rights . &quot;
he said he already started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the post is in a certain way inspir@@ ational , as it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so if we do not learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , whoever does not know his own story is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s most monumental work , Frank Cast@@ or@@ f works on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e performance in front of gigantic , six @-@ story . &quot;
the turn@@ stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) indicates a s@@ hab@@ by street with a wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin . a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from the GDR @-@ Time or the New York Stock Exchange .
&quot; before it par@@ ted an open Mercedes @-@ Old@@ timer , in which the Rhin@@ op@@ ener appears as rock @-@ style , or alternatively an ino@@ setta . &quot;
&quot; stain@@ ed oil cas@@ ks remember Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and greed - that goes through his &quot; &quot; ring &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the three Rhin@@ ocer@@ os - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ell@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ieren like in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; let them dec@@ eive the Sieg@@ fried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , Bro@@ ken in Hollywood Man@@ ier in the trunk and give the Kra@@ w@@ allo @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the deli@@ ght@@ fully Ha@@ gen that surrounds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ ness .
brutal the scene than he sm@@ iles Sieg@@ fried .
later I also have to believe Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) .
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with powerful applause .
&quot; stor@@ my are celebrated Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Di@@ tion@@ ent Jan@@ owski , who is humble and the hands of Merkel @-@ smoking . &quot;
&quot; big applause are available for the Festival Orchestra , which shows for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in leisure time @-@ clothes . &quot;
the performance was expected by Frank Cast@@ or@@ f and his assistant .
&quot; if he had to leave 2013 a long @-@ looking pillar concert over himself , there were five years later great che@@ ers , in which the &quot; &quot; bu@@ h &quot; &quot; ru@@ fe came down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Kath@@ arina Wagner is expected to be happy about this .
&quot; one noted that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; in some way , she had told shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ or@@ f , but it also has grown as an understanding of its view . &quot;
I draw a positive Res@@ um@@ é .
Max is working as a volunteer
they work in their Volun@@ te@@ er Year right at several places .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt , in the furniture store , once in the week I help here in Gre@@ ys in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have worked in the open whole day on the school .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late volunteer volunteer . &quot;
how does it come about ?
quantity : I have made Ab@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a civil engineering degree , we say , successfully interrupted . &quot;
&quot; I have known for myself , that it &apos;s wrong for me and I want to do something else with people . &quot;
and then I asked what you do .
&quot; take a social year , since there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at the focal point also , really . &quot;
and was it like that ?
lot : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
&quot; I will be dual , probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , a social job training and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the Volun@@ te@@ er Service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it is probably always on where to make up his FS@@ J .
one can make it from anti@@ quity to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
&quot; for me , it was exactly the right thing that irrit@@ ates me . &quot;
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really does .
unlike in the Bau@@ ingenie@@ ur@@ inary studies ?
&quot; quantity : well clear , here it is not about to be reck@@ on . &quot;
there is always other people in mind that each has a very different story behind them .
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been caught out of the family - you must always respond to it individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : for this I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; great love , lots of kindness . &quot;

&quot; Pear@@ son abbrevi@@ ated further 3,000 jobs and abbrevi@@ ation the dividend to rein@@ vigor@@ ate the business &quot;
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut off their intermediate stations for 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be started to overcome the pressure that the company is confronted with . &quot;
&quot; the job creation , Director of John Fall@@ on predominantly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which already lost 4,000 positions . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced a plan on cost reduction by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a shop which was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which had expressed its participation in Pen@@ gu@@ in Rand@@ om House on the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year is unchanged , after having achieved a rise of 1 percent to € 2.@@ 05 billion in the first half of the year . &quot;
con@@ voy attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier in su@@ icide killed
&quot; a su@@ icide bom@@ b@@ aker has attacked a military con@@ voy of the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a soldier of Nato and several others are injured , saying officials . &quot;
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter were injured and shared a statement from Nato .
&quot; un@@ confirmed local reports died in the incident in the district of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , also three civilians . &quot;
&quot; bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan met this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at . &quot;
&quot; on Monday a su@@ icide , two people were killed near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in an opinion of Nato , it is said that the explosion at Thursday night was to happen when a common pat@@ rol by the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; of persons &quot; impro@@ vised explo@@ sives . &quot;
the statement states that all injured in a stable state are in a stable state and are treated in the U.S. military hospital at Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
&quot; according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 there was at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths , of which approximately 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a su@@ icide auto@@ clave had at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban told they had made this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a huge bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city was more than 150 people with the deadly militant attack of the country , since the US @-@ led troops reached the Taliban from power . &quot;
&quot; the violence under@@ scores the pre@@ occupation security situation in Afghanistan , since U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering the number of US troops , military and police support in the country . &quot;
correspon@@ dents said that the su@@ icide attacks in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government to have caused its policy and especially in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani .
EPA has made a decision to delay the smo@@ g rule to K@@ ann@@ um
&quot; the US @-@ American Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama , wai@@ ved what states are obliged to inf@@ use the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 states def@@ endants the agency because of the p@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone @-@ regulations 2015 &quot; and said , they show the commitment of the agency to work with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and remember that we react to our state partners , &quot; said EPA @-@ Chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations in which parts of the country should be measured in a part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions , to comply with stric@@ ter aviation standards - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , was law@@ suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a broad range of environmental regulations that the former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a broader agenda , which is to boost economic growth , according to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the back of Democrats and reserves to worry about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that the inhal@@ ing of air , the o@@ zone also contains &quot; the lung function and ampli@@ fy the symptoms of symptoms , such as as@@ thma . &quot;
community wants community @-@ community
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : on two objects the municipal der@@ ate of Flu@@ orn winds the establishment of a common area in the future senior residence . &quot;
&quot; in front of the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the remaining missing section was signed , the Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades reported . &quot;
&quot; although it is still going to last until now , until now the Church of Church of the Church is owned , but there is no planning stage for that of a private investor to a st@@ em@@ ulation project . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion about a common area . &quot;
&quot; one of the two investors who are still in the boat , has been offered to meet the church . &quot;
on the ground floor he would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters area for a special price .
&quot; the administration and majority of the community of the community so@@ ars before , such a common room not only as a meeting point for the residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ fair living , but open to the community . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word of &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; made the lap . &quot;
&quot; the decision , which has been decided by providing funds for the current budget already last autumn , by funding opportunities . &quot;
the building is in the refurb@@ ishment area .
&quot; the establishment of a common area would be , so reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the decision @-@ proposal looks to signal the investor that in this regard , it doesn &apos;t want to throw in this regard no bil@@ lets between the legs - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which makes the trac@@ kl@@ ace reduced and the construction of economic power - as possible would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , so do not only do Wil@@ fred Soh@@ mer , be this supplement . &quot;
when &apos; s helps : unanimously he passes on the panel .
it is not that easy when the common room .
&quot; Daniela Call refers to the many own buildings with which you are not going to go right now , but you are now living in the common room out of the window , says : &quot; I don &apos;t make me hard with it . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger has absolutely talks about the common area - however , absolutely against a municipal participation . &quot;
it considers it a covered sub @-@ invention of@@ ten@@ acity or foreign investors .
&quot; that is not like that , because with the acquisition of the area there is no grant , but getting a real one , in a branch case , is the counter @-@ speaking . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ en@@ ant &apos;s request , to vali@@ date the proposal for proposal , finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it remains in two head@@ lines with the original program that Stefan H@@ alles summar@@ ized : &quot; &quot; if we grasp the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge amount in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with car : cycl@@ ist will be s@@ lit on road

the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must so@@ ak the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel , FC Bayern will travel to the first mandatory match of the new season to Dortmund . &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title of the Super@@ cup in the Super@@ cup against the Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger .

Trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must refrain in Du@@ el with BV@@ B also on David Al@@ aba .
this confirmed the Italians on Friday .
&quot; moreover , the nom@@ inees are missing Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ y@@ Rob@@ ben und Juan Bern@@ at . &quot;
&quot; for the five defeats in the past six test , An@@ cel@@ otti did the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; that was last not good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , however , believes in an increase in the first official schedule of the season . &quot;
&quot; soccer is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is an &quot; difficult &quot; intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football wei@@ ghts attracts the fans in their spell .
&quot; the game is sold with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 viewers , distributed the Deutsche Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
at the Har@@ z star from Stern to Stern
&quot; in Har@@ z the national &quot; &quot; star@@ gre@@ ad &quot; &quot; is supposed to arise . &quot;
this is planning the association Stern@@ warte Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planetary path exists in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; comes to the information needs of many hard@@ ships , meant it . &quot;
&quot; he connecting nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
the members want to set up along the planned route and inform them about stars and star patterns .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; well @-@ reaching installations at five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; demand for men St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the boards should be supple@@ mented by the internet .
&quot; that is why , in the selection of the selection , a good mobile network reception plays a role . &quot;
accessibility is a criterion .
&quot; later , the star@@ ring train should be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star trail , the viewer also experienced a lot of knowledge about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star is more lumin@@ aire than another , even though it is much farther away . &quot;
&quot; I will also know , in which constellation can find themselves a selected star , and when he is best to see . &quot;
the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg and the highest located observatory in northern Germany .
the site in the middle of the National Park Har@@ z is according to the federal protection of the federal protection for the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there are the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ meda galaxy with naked eye clearly visible .
&quot; since 2003 , there has been on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen somewhat similar as the planned star@@ base - the planetary path . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path leads up with its poles through up to Hain@@ berg and to the observatory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the p@@ els with the single planet - including the d@@ warf @-@ planned Plu@@ to at the end point - are accurately positioned at the distance and a scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth dro@@ pping so on a bul@@ let of 6.5 mm in diameter , while the sun is exactly 70 cen@@ tim@@ etres from the sun . &quot;
the entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers .
&quot; while the light of sun takes about eight hours to Plu@@ to , pedest@@ rians need a good hour to the St@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pedestrian is therefore faster than light in the cosmos .
the march to the next Fi@@ x@@ Star can still last half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko meet for the first time and discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia are supposed to stand in a coll@@ isions in the near future among 147 pounds and met for the first time on Thursday .

&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; How do you think , Champion ? &quot;
&quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 am on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is climate , that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; &quot; remembered Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I went up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to run@@ down on loan weight .
and he must move to Lei@@ cht@@ wei@@ ler &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this will require the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko has agreed .
&quot; bo@@ xing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; climate &apos;s asked whether it should be in pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko with a 135 @-@ pound debut in this year must arrange a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has interested in the fight against the winner of the Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell at the Forum on 23 September . &quot;
&quot; this battle could be held in pay @-@ by @-@ view mode because all fans have asked for him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and expressed themselves later to fight for the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , he treasures Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko as &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko held in the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the triple champion from River@@ side look very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you tried the co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus was to show head@@ star@@ ch , then speakers . &quot;
&quot; both said , they could feel the Mom@@ entum , which built themselves for their own struggle . &quot;
&quot; this is the fight , which must be done . &quot;
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work in it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko said : &quot; I was waiting for the top fighters and that is Mi@@ key .
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four hours after tire @-@ gro@@ wer
&quot; during an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were wounded on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost in front of the IC Z@@ af@@ ira against 16.@@ 30 pm in front of the connectivity market , presumably after a tire @-@ burst , control over his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the car reb@@ elled to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he survived and then remained on the roof of the green strip . &quot;
the four mates - two adults and two children - were heavily injured during the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the wounded service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction north for about an hour , then the traffic could be guided by the left ro@@ cking at the accident location . &quot;
Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; triple chain works better &quot;
&quot; Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2 : 2 to the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that the optimization of the defensive formation in Au@@ e points will bring . &quot;
&quot; with the first season of the season , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result , as not the two oppos@@ ites had been at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we must fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the defensive player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge Mountains the three @-@ chain can also be optimized further .
and a gateway to a Fre@@ isto@@ ß would like to join the Fort@@ ress even more .
for the future it will be that no more than Michael ( R@@ ensing ) will stand on the line .
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better right after the experience in preparation with the three @-@ chain , than with the four chain . &quot;
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his Trainer Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we just have in the three @-@ chain on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ mann players who can build well &quot; &quot; Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , but that we are even better harmon@@ ieren and we don &apos;t afford to do so much ab@@ uses . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann moves to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if one cannot speak after an accident by a miserable start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance might be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; if we stand on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the podium , we will certainly be able to speak of a neat season . &quot;
he wanted to know his coach .
&quot; the start into the season evalu@@ ates I only after six to eight days , &quot; &quot; Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over o@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to an accident . &quot;
&quot; now they can easily start the season with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believes that players from Au@@ e might even be some fres@@ her , since they had no heavy and complete play like Fort@@ una against a rise in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; says the inside of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; though , the guests from the Rhein@@ land go as a lighter Favor@@ ite on Sunday in the meeting in the last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we carry it away because we have the right to come under the first six , is Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ acity , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet is at only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games quite positively . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga , which you must hit from the outset , &quot; says Fort@@ un@@ as chief coach . &quot;
&quot; to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t , and over@@ jo@@ yed . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el will not experience his players on Sunday in any case .
new results of the Swedish asylum application tests published
&quot; recent findings by tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that over 80 percent of the tested persons older than 18 years are . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for for@@ en@@ sic medicine ( Pu@@ zzles medic@@ in@@ al@@ sales ) has started to carry out tests last year .
&quot; they should make the assessment of the age more precisely during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration authorities ( migration shor@@ et ) has been critic@@ ised because of errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees . &quot;
&quot; up to now , migrant shor@@ et 6.@@ 8@@ 80 has been ma@@ iled and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed the person &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion that the person may be &quot; possibly under the age of 18 . &quot;
the tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent with the last months . &quot;
&quot; we do not see any big difference in statistics of past months , the numbers are quite consistent , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases where the person was assessed as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers has taken over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases to suggest that the examination person may be 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det , the 5@@ 81 published results found it , that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that it will be 18 years old that this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical research assessment , made in the x @-@ ray pictures of knee teeth , which are then analysed by tooth@@ ed and radi@@ ologist , was also critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
a skep@@ tic is the En@@ do@@ kr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they were sooner or later as usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
assessing the biological age in this way is very in@@ secure .
&quot; if we cannot say it certainly , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended however the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is in it if the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are well progres@@ sing .
&quot; on Wednesday , there was a seven tons of emphasis on the bridge at the eastern side of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold L@@ asi@@ ly , builder manager at the department of road beings and traffic in the government of the President of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April the work began simultaneously on all three san@@ itation , between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building is scheduled for October and Easy is certain that the timing is observed .
&quot; coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , takes over the tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ ault bridge of concrete , which is ar@@ ra@@ yed with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total @-@ length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; as the two other bridges , she has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure the stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly san@@ ed . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively . 10.@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance to the town of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on the mid@@ day morning on the northern side a 1.@@ 30 meters wide and seven tonnes heavy as so @-@ called bread@@ cap .
&quot; this is a boundary to be used , which is also used as an operating route . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the southern part of the bridge is to be used on Friday a 2.@@ 20 meters wide br@@ ush@@ cap . &quot;
then the pedestrian trail should be gone .
&quot; the special thing is that it is concerned about the parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bracel@@ ets .
particular finger @-@ pointed @-@ feeling has the embarrass@@ ment of cables by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach requires .
&quot; because there is also a glass of fiber , connected to which many companies are connected . &quot;
the residents were informed about the work in advance of work through hand@@ outs .
&quot; in addition , they had to decrease fish and cr@@ abs . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the construction site and the gathering in direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic @-@ lane is regulated by a traffic lights . &quot;
&quot; for construction on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher town@@ ship , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the Hotel &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully locked . &quot;
the costs for the three rolls are together 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colorful protest in German potato salad
&quot; it is not so frequent that parties go to a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , comes together , what else is difficult to bring to a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad coalition that presents on this day peaceful flag because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell invites to the poster &quot; great electoral campaign &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land , the leading directors of the Parliament elections on September 24 , is , and the Vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix from Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ eag@@ les , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colourful . &quot;
&quot; originally , the city @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the fountain site , but now takes place on the parking lot below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D @-@ Event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that has to offer .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chairman of the Forum A world and one of the leading organizers , really rejoice : &quot; great , how many people came here together . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D without problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who has brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police took many officials from Ger@@ ol@@ stein , she presents presence especially at the train station , which is only a few meters from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D come on Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
&quot; Mario Hom@@ es reported by the Af@@ D volcano ei@@ fel , he tried to make such an event and get the surcharge . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there had been a cancellation , because of the already built Laur@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes are not enough parking available . &quot;
&quot; so , the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ es is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; with a view to the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;

&quot; both of them are winners and winners of numerous international competitions , and have Sol@@ opo@@ si@@ tions in European top orches@@ tras . &quot;
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ ly is the SW@@ R Symph@@ onic orchestra .
&quot; both combines the desire , not only the limits on their instruments , but also merge the boundaries of the various genres . &quot;

Kr@@ isten Ste@@ wart talks about their bis@@ ex@@ ual ality
&quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese and will eat him until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I would like to try all , &quot; &quot; says Kr@@ isten Ste@@ wart very openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ual ality . &quot;
&quot; when I teach in gri@@ lled che@@ eses , I think &quot; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of the Hol@@ ly@@ re stars was the &quot; &quot; t@@ wilight &quot; &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ in@@ son who are ultimately bitter . &quot;
&quot; despite all this ass@@ ures the brunette performer opposite the &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; I was in love with everyone whom I have master@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; or do you think about , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kr@@ isten gave that it bis@@ ex@@ ual , &quot; &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed du@@ alism . &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
I just liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them I have suffered them according to &quot; Bang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in school days , when she would prefer to dress like a bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really has me very hurt .
&quot; when I was eleven I told me the children , I would look like a book . &quot;
I really felt attacked and frightened and ashamed .
&quot; now look back and think about it , &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the general public they don &apos;t like to live her love life , &quot; people expect you to change in a certain way and make a lot of me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some call me un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the public . &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he switches the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thurs@@ days at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump to change the party . &quot;
&quot; if you like it or not , Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Governor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today , I will tell you with many prayers and many re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the manifestation broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; as a coach , I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump desp@@ ised a HU@@ GE announcement in the West Virginia Rall@@ ye .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not show the democratic nom@@ inee Hill@@ ary Clinton .
&quot; Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state according to For@@ bes , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes establishes that he possesses coal mining in five states and from his father inherited a carbon store .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee opened a statement on Thursday night , in which it said : &quot; the Party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic party that would rather have been working to work for us to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ments and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , initial message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ Chair Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ e lo@@ oms &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing scandal &quot;
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an un@@ informed ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed back in sports . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics head of Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ alan@@ ine , said during the IA@@ AF Congress in the eve of athle@@ tics World Championships , that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; all athletes , who were cut off at the gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for maintaining the Forbidden , which was in November 2015 , after a report of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( W@@ ada ) notes on state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia had been found . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the Re@@ porters . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized for itself , that they have experienced some fairly hot times and do everything possible to make sure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; he said he was also &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; that Russia accept the criteria for its re @-@ establishment . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress was achieved , but the congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; nin@@ ety of Russian athletes compete in the athle@@ tics World Championships on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia still need to fulfill some of the criteria for re@@ setting . &quot;
&quot; threats tests were still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , he said Re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
O@@ bit@@ u@@ aries for in Mali cras@@ hed soldiers
&quot; at a funeral service in the north @-@ east Frit@@ z@@ lar , approximately 1000 people of the two were thought of a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
&quot; to still un@@ clarified , defense of Defense from the Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot;
&quot; they referred to the two up@@ ann@@ ot@@ ters , but as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner &apos;s expert . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we dec@@ eive ourselves against this highest victim , which they provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; stated . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year staff soldier from Nord@@ h@@ essen had come to life on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
their S@@ är@@ ge were transferred to Germany and was accompanied by a death @-@ guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
&quot; at mid@@ day , first of all , only the relatives were in the church farewell . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral ceremony began in the circle of the family , eng@@ ster friends , of representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and the Policy . &quot;
among them were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; Trau@@ mat@@ ing laid ro@@ ses , the relatives were standing in the arm to the S@@ är@@ gen . &quot;
in front of the church Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ k and numerous soldiers pursued the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; Secretary @-@ Defense of the Le@@ yen , the up@@ lifting soldiers recorded as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and fr@@ am@@ using . &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann was built up the flight operation of the Kampf@@ h@@ ub@@ bolt tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar with and was one of the first six trained tigers of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the reg@@ iment , to which the soldiers belong , stated : &quot; if this occupation could not turn the crash , then it would not have wasted . &quot;
doubts about the UN Mission in Mali showed Prime Minister of Le@@ yen not : the use is dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; for a country , by which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral service the legend has been brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are pun@@ ched , the Bundes@@ wehr made no information . &quot;
prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to pun@@ ched his wife after his death . &quot;
that shared the king &apos;s house on Thursday with .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish Royal wal@@ ar is buried in the cathedral @-@ church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard already made a coff@@ in ha@@ g for the two .
the queen was with the decision of her husband and meant it further in the message .
where prince Hen@@ rik bury is still unclear .
but he did not have the intention of being buried in his French homeland .
prince Hen@@ rik had never made a bunch of it that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the ascent of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would be fond of King . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he went into retirement and also sets the title &quot; Prin@@ ted ma@@ hl . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark does not have the title and the function he wanted , he see himself as equal to his wife - also not after death , declared L@@ ene b@@ by , the boss of the Danish royal house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will eventually be , be unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not have the intention of being buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French Adel@@ s@@ ville , had known Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
he worked at the Thames in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later woman , the sympath@@ ies of the people always pointed out , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his barely 50 @-@ year @-@ old regime . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival all I did , critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; my D@@ än@@ ian was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , sil@@ lu@@ gs instead of kn@@ it@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Vol@@ vo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ pra@@ ises , which I smo@@ kes out of Virginia @-@ tobacco and in this country the call had the reputation to be the trademark of Social @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
these were the same two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants swift re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; according to the loss of red @-@ green governance , Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is subject to the loss of red @-@ green governance for a swift re@@ election of the country &apos;s day , but he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
because he spoke on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament .
&quot; previously , the surprising exit of a Green Party in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a difficult crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official appointment of the elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scarce A @-@ vote majority in the Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the previous Green MEP El@@ ke T@@ ests created their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election of 2018 in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she declared on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U Leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its group to take them .
&quot; the CD@@ U and F@@ DP have reached 69 seats in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on land , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new land day will be elected regular on 14 January next year .
&quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , the red @-@ green national government should now decide whether to rule in this situation without majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l does however , it is indispensable for the fact that the country &apos;s day is rapidly approaching its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on Tuesday on Tuesday .
the country &apos;s Constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the country &apos;s Parliament draws the trust and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these options must be legally tested thoroughly , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said . &quot;
&quot; you will discuss all questions in peace , if they are legally checked . &quot;
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ wes@@ ens &quot; &quot; but something cur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; the political leader himself stressed , &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she was referred to as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Greens called for the le@@ ak@@ y to return to the return of their country summit .
&quot; we take of course , of course , that she has received its Land@@ tag , which she has received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; shared the Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the presidents of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said , &quot; &quot; we regret the decision by El@@ ke T@@ ests extremely . &quot;
you have deliberately decided to make no pron@@ unciation in the faction .
&quot; also in front of the background that there was no sub@@ stan@@ tive differences , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or Martin Schulz condemned the crossing of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party El@@ ke T@@ ests to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the elec@@ torate and voters , but also betra@@ yal in Red @-@ Green , &quot; wrote the Council of Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; he supported the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , to quickly choose the land day . &quot;
leaving T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the political leader &quot; &quot; in her last van@@ ity and in her frustration her personal interests before the well @-@ being of the country , &quot; critici@@ zed SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a scandal that the CD@@ U in Nieder@@ sachsen makes this dirty in@@ filtr@@ es , and tries to strike it political capital . &quot;
low @-@ fac@@ eted CD@@ U @-@ fac@@ tions Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its MEPs to take El@@ ke T@@ ests in the CD@@ U .
&quot; the Leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ ests , with personality careers , the result of the draft election in 2013 to fal@@ si@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was at that time the SPD strong power , SPD and Greens had a hau@@ led majority in the country &apos;s day but a hau@@ ling majority of one voice . &quot;
&quot; agriculture Minister in the interview - How to protect us from Gi@@ f@@ tei@@ es , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discussed over contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
&quot; governor , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is talking in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer . &quot;
Mr Schmidt . how can the consumers protect themselves from poison@@ ous eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer inside and consumers who watch eggs in your fridge and review the stamp .
&quot; on the consumer site www.@@ grocery store , the Bundes@@ länder will present the latest information on the eggs affected by the eggs . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if after all we are currently aware , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded . &quot;
&quot; now Al@@ di takes the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - , because the central role of the author of the Federal Minister of the Federal Minister is not really perceived ? &quot;
the food monitoring is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately switched off and since announcement of the dis@@ agreement of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade has the same as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold @-@ selling products are traffic @-@ capable and hygien@@ ically harmless .
&quot; if with eggs of the resi@@ dual salary of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not traffic @-@ capable . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time not the farms to blame .
are production facilities and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; after the par@@ able knowledge of knowledge , the output industry is not an immediate fault . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must reck@@ on due to mut@@ ing illegal practices of service companies with economic damages . &quot;
as always there is too little control in the harvest .
is it possible only on the staff or at the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
but it was just the official controls that have uncovered the procedure .
&quot; to the truth , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a consequ@@ ent clarification of such events and the transfer to the pro@@ secut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences may be made of decisive significance . &quot;
I have already made clearly many times that I expect complete learning from the responsible authorities .
is the regular alar@@ mis@@ m at food sk@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumer consumers have the right to get only safe and traffic @-@ skilled food exclusively .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ tici@@ de can be used in the food industry , consumers and consumers are rightly outra@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; the pan@@ ging means are manufacturers , dealers and consumers into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ t Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food suppliers is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately . &quot;
this has to be consistent on all levels and worked on high pressure .
&quot; I expect from all the competent authorities , that the facts can be solved quickly and un@@ resolved . &quot;
how to manage the Committee on Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s moving to Paris
&quot; the rules that aim to prevent un@@ checked issues of European foot@@ ball@@ ers , Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s world @-@ ord transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain will not distur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A yet , because the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power , teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules which were launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million Euros ( 26@@ 2 million $ ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from its contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make sure that you loose the money to make Ne@@ ym@@ ar and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy rich mist@@ resses of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; associations are allowed to aver@@ t a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but they need to object with legitimate acceptance sources , which allow them to have the Bre@@ ak wei@@ rd point in their way to the football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini at the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French players believed that clubs that had enormous debt in their pursuit of success , effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ki@@ cked to ruin , if banks or owners re@@ ared their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 FF@@ P rose from concentration on debt debt to the monitoring of their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in 2003 - a club with potential bought and then invested heavily in order to build the crew and build a global brand - to become a tougher issue . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year warranty period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini is fallen by the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to be deter@@ red by excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will meet the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible at UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , towards The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a Pau@@ line , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing on the duration of his contract . &quot;
&quot; Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five @-@ year treaty , so that the resolution can be exp@@ ired for the next five years in the amount of EUR 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million in the year . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has met the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a money of 60 million Euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later was lowered to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that Mann@@ ers members are limited to the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of normal 25 players remaining . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to list their financial statements by raising their income by companies , who are connected to the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a cat@@ cher company could spontaneous the PS@@ G if the value of the sponsor@@ ing should exceed the default market rates , the UEF@@ A would not apply this as a legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsorship of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
&quot; it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar could come across payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup , in Qatar . &quot;
&quot; however , PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have denied that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Cup ambassador will be simply and a such maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could simply figure out . &quot;
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G means that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive , any attempt to avoid the rules . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announ@@ cing on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke to the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last fiscal year must be published .
PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrival is a bo@@ on for Sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot@@ ic purchases . &quot;
the association assumes that sales after signing up at least 30 percent will rise .
&quot; the Spanish League has been clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s im@@ itation by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; finance D@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to the latter owner of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owners and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the ban@@ al Fair@@ play , because you can have different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is in search of a new shock supplier
in the past years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Board chocolate has produced for the Swiss .
&quot; now , the following cooperation is faced with a possible end : the airline writes the order again . &quot;

&quot; around 17 million small red @-@ white Sho@@ gg@@ it@@ af@@ ers are distributed to 14 grams per year , the flight companion in front of the landing at the passengers . &quot;

but more importantly the advertising effect is : for a shock manufacturer it is a prestigious job .
&quot; how many applicants are there for the new tender , the Swiss does not want to betra@@ y him . &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers come from .
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the Treaty establishing the Spring of 2018 . &quot;
for the SD@@ A the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .
chocolate tables spread the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
&quot; before the Swiss having completed a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut was delivered in collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets . &quot;
&quot; the possibility to place the logo , Swiss took place two years ago with the start of collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gically due to the glorious days of characters of the 80 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( as the pr@@ den@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ wal@@ ter the Sk@@ et@@ ch Com@@ edy &quot; &quot; The State &quot; &quot; for M@@ TV 3 years before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories . &quot;
but as a franchise it feels like the time was short .
&quot; first day of Camp &quot; was surprisingly good , not only because of his absurd Hum@@ ors ( it enth@@ r@@ ammed the original story for a speaking short of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by raising themselves at the core of the g@@ ags - actor middle @-@ age play dirty children , who will grow up - nevertheless , they still manage the im@@ possibility to return the last part of the wi@@ dows . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , with its adults who are playing adults now is less emotional , and his par@@ o@@ dy is going to know more after the casting principle , including a reef on the stal@@ ker @-@ movies of the 90 @-@ he years like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; &quot; ( &quot; The hand that regul@@ ates the cradle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at a point st@@ ony a character by an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some In@@ line Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the gracious co@@ op ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ e@@ au ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is yet another crazy P@@ lot that is involved in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well done impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
as usual are the courses of the best part of franchise .
&quot; it is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ os Unter@@ li@@ ppen@@ che of &quot; singles &quot; shows , the former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; it is the moments of accidental del@@ usion that could take this franchise like a sort of repeti@@ tive &apos; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches what I see as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater &quot; , &quot; whose last scene will show the Ban@@ de as she will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; at Amazon remembers a different type of nostal@@ gia : to the rev@@ itali@@ zation of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic B@@ lon@@ de &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ West @-@ West @-@ con@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created Com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director , there is a found TV series with the two poli@@ c@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , athe@@ ism and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
the main wheels - a hard tro@@ ot@@ ten@@ er Gregor and an ide@@ alistic Io@@ z@@ sef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogs of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a exec@@ uting producer ) and Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt are syn@@ ced to English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
&quot; there are some nice walks on watching ( the police spends the time to watch chess on TV , how Americans might do with football ) . &quot;
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ u Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a des@@ perate propaganda , a mur@@ derer that carries a Re@@ agan mask , is involved - that it is often like a single . &quot;
&quot; with six long episodes , it turns out , and the com@@ edy is not fast or often enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; , &quot; which was re@@ vit@@ alized on a lower length , since Gregor and Io@@ z@@ sef , could always visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a pile of bur@@ gers . &quot;
the new communist audience &apos;s message is that Western culture can do everything to the food for a joint venture .
the fic@@ tional Romanian creator would not be wrong : we even do it with our own recent history and theirs .
blow against drugs @-@ Mafia in the country
the police took a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on the mid@@ day morning , in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen , and Stuttgart were numerous objects going through , like the pro@@ secutor &apos;s const@@ ancy on Friday . &quot;
15 accus@@ ations were arrested in the age between 25 and 77 years and have already handed over arrest warrant against them .
&quot; in addition , the officials presented large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , bul@@ lets and several hundreds of thousands of thousands . &quot;
at the same swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Italians there were German Ar@@ rest War@@ rant .
the two will therefore probably be delivered to Germany .
in the action Italian and Bav@@ arian investig@@ ators were involved .
&quot; in total , more than 300 poli@@ c@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Mafia organised crime crime , severe violence , experim@@ entation as well as rob@@ bery and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; already since summer 2016 , the Public Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Convention against the organized drug trade in the South German region . &quot;
&quot; between the prosecution in Constance and Palermo , an active exchange and investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had an almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the big use in the mid@@ day tomorrow was accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the sight of the investigations , especially Italian nation@@ als related to the Italian Mafia . &quot;
&quot; also an incident on May 27th at Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account of the Ban@@ de . &quot;
way laments large gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; data from citizens , which should not arise &quot; : a report according to the foreig@@ ner in Germany have significant shortcomings in Germany . &quot;
this lead to partly gra@@ zing mis@@ decisions in asylum @-@ procedures .
&quot; the officer for the refugee management of the German government , Frank @-@ Jürgen , has drawn attention to large gaps in the country @-@ country register . &quot;
&quot; defects associated with the registered data could lead to asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations &quot; &quot; partly gra@@ vi@@ cious lack of failure &quot; , &quot; warned in an analysis , which is the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the Register , there are some 10 million people with foreign nation@@ als , including about 5.2 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by about 600 foreigners in Germany .
&quot; because the data were not sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts so far has not been good . &quot;
&quot; in cases where data from 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and actually no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data inser@@ ts can considerably slow back processes , &quot; it is said to continue the report . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the statistics on the other EU citizens are covered by EU citizens who would not have to travel at all . &quot;
&quot; such false barriers , however , led to a distorted debate on how to deal with foreigners , &quot; it is said to be analysed in analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has obviously started to return refugee families with 16 @-@ year children back to Italy when they arrived from there . &quot;
&quot; this is derived from an internal paper of the Federal Ministry of Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ ons ( BAM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ re Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper this means , the BAM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; regarding families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspapers under reference to the difficult situation on the spot . &quot;
&quot; following the Dublin agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach them first . &quot;
&quot; if a refugee travels to another EU country , this state can withdraw him back to the country . &quot;
&quot; for the reason , the ministry is now writing : &quot; meanwhile , the recording capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy increased significantly . &quot;
Italy made for the inclusion and accommodation of families guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ r@@ t@@ HR ) consider these commitments for sufficient .
other EU countries would also be able to res@@ train refugees as part of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the domestic policy spokes@@ person in Lin@@ ks@@ frac@@ tures in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children dro@@ w because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system un@@ lawful preparation and a haz@@ ard to the child . &quot;

&quot; in this way , three people could benefit from a blood don@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported of the actions that are carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved with 114 don@@ ators , the second best result , &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K preparation team . &quot;

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
Bank of England is expected to appear later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation must be vacc@@ inated over a rise in inflation .
&quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; will remain &quot; &quot; as they held interest rates on family income in the middle of a intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; policy makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates down to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members a rise in this month since the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened its support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly In@@ fl@@ ation@@ Report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 on 1.7 % and for 2018 on 1,6 % and warned that pressure on fiscal income would continue , with inflation in the autumn is likely to rise to almost 3 % . &quot;
but they sign@@ alized that in the coming years Z@@ inser@@ tions would be necessary to breed the inflation caused by the Bre@@ xit and they said that the borro@@ wing may need to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
&quot; members also agreed to withdraw a part of the Mam@@ mut &apos;s economic package , which was issued a year after the Bre@@ xit . &quot;
&quot; it will demand time for finance plan to provide cheaper funding for banks starting from the coming February , though , that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; following the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central pre@@ diction of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in short notice , since pressure on the real@@ ein@@ ment of households will continue to be charged . &quot;
&quot; to the interest rates repeated it repeated that &quot; a certain imp@@ unity of monetary policy &quot; would be required for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; greater &quot; &quot; extent necessary than the markets . &quot;
the markets predicted first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank stressed that there would be &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Bank resulted in the growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are projected by 1.9 % and 1,7 % in May . &quot;
she has maintained its growth forecasts on 1.8 % in the year 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages opposite the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ proportion@@ ately growth figures have raised the increasing expectations on a cement increase and increase GDP in the second quarter of 0.@@ 2 % in the previous three months to 0.@@ 3 % .
&quot; growth is expected to recover in the third quarter at 0.@@ 3 % , although it is easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent in@@ flow report offered little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by a rising inflation and minor en@@ closures as the shar@@ pen@@ ing is first even worse , before it is repaired . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy cannot prevent the income in the next few years &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages will be clearly to recover at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attribut@@ able to the weak pound weight , which will compens@@ ate for a portion of lower consumption expendi@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August after the shocking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ ks of the p@@ otion . &quot;
the Bank appreci@@ ates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and economy .
&quot; prior to the last judgment of the Bank to the interest rates , the call had risen to a cement increase , since inflation increased pressure on hard and increased budgets , with three political decision makers in July demanded a rise to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has declined last month from 2,@@ 9 % in June to 2,@@ 6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected to attract again in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said that the crossing in relation to its goal of 2 % is &quot; quite &quot; to the weak pound .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ onia Bro@@ ker , said : &quot; in view of the recent return of S@@ wap instal@@ ments , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , since the len@@ ders want to search for business and end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly good for those with which the existing De@@ als run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be the controversial HIV @-@ drug 10,000 people
&quot; in September , patients will receive access to a &quot; transforming &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September in September after a fight against the drug funding in the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a prior to intercourse was taken before sexual risk pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection at high @-@ risk cancer , now by health service over a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he explained ready to finance the process after the Appe@@ als Court had confirmed a judgement of the Supreme Court of Justice last year , after that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pro@@ EP despite the claim that local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the written report announced on Thursday , was welcomed by N@@ HS England leader Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as a &quot; important new intervention , &quot; whereas the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) referred to this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first to follow the registration of people and further clinics will follow in October until it will be introduced in April 2018 . &quot;
predic@@ ting pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV preparations that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP reduces the HIV transmission on infectious diseases significantly .
taking in front of the sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs may be taken every day or as two hours before intercourse .
&quot; to those who come for treatment , belong to gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; clinics are identified for participants who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status will not be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy . &quot;
people who are living in England and are registered with a resident doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the programme will signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the supply of drugs during this week following an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of the EP by clinical evidence , as it is implemented in a large scale , is implemented and implemented . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to enhance HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; EP , if it is targeted to the needy and endangered people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner which leads to improving many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be done that the study is quickly carried out throughout the country and that no one who has left risk to HIV . &quot;
&quot; now that the Pr@@ EP test medicine was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow Health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome and over@@ due to monthly delays and hesit@@ ating realisation by the government . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can finish the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of the EP .
&quot; it is important now that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will contribute to the ending of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
the great life live : mezz@@ anine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a room@@ y home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , shr@@ unk from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack their bags and sells her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
&quot; this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I was in love with them and made an offer on this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet of the apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; originally a one @-@ bedroom estate with a wasted layout - you had to go through the kitchen , to get into the bedroom - wanted to add jo@@ anne storage space and a mezz@@ anine to use the generous ceiling height . &quot;
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , big windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; this was my request , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , they commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , which was 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the blan@@ ket was not large enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezz@@ anine in which one could stand . &quot;
I had to think creative thinking to release the stock .
&quot; the steel works is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were over@@ thrown over , without which we had to b@@ ate ourselves . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to lay the steel so that it had the right heights above or down . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement made it possible to place Er@@ fan , two rooms in full height - with a lot of extra drama . &quot;
for the mezz@@ anine looks a classic copper window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us over the glam@@ orous living area .
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , sil@@ ber@@ ne acc@@ ents and Vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illum@@ ination set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; mir@@ rors plays a role in adding a theatre , space and light . &quot;
at both ends is a short corridor mir@@ r@@ ored to make it more effective .
in the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance they have mir@@ r@@ ored units space for all the seating and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; by perception of a glam@@ orous space , the beauty of living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering was there , &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the st@@ ahl@@ reinforced , fur@@ nit@@ ated M@@ DF door . &quot;
&quot; it is very important , so it is when you slide the door very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base for sale - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a rudi@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size size . &quot;
&quot; here they managed to increase the ground floor , and at the same time use top quality materials , which allows the space to gain its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and who therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not love you into the electric plu@@ gs in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of slightly smaller into something completely unacceptable .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to not leave them . &quot;
brothers fighting for a 500 million US dollars .
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confrontation because of one of the largest real estate imperial Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &quot; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos;s and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business should be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul already wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers met 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family has bought a business in Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co Je@@ ans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail business . &quot;
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis is now offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; according to an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - was described by Paul as &quot; &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a judicial record states that this means Col@@ in property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul valued at the value of 17@@ 6 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in proposed resolutions have left him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed recru@@ iting the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now fight for control of the existing business - what Col@@ in , as Paul claimed to be excluded . &quot;
&quot; argued , this was not true , but raises Paul before , some possessions in@@ competent to manage . &quot;
&quot; in an early affair , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hope to raise the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian legacy writes , that the family is the most important priority &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost increases in the event , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both sides held law . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her died husband Luigi were Italian immigrants to run the milk @-@ bars and delic@@ acy stores from the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early seven@@ ties .
&quot; you used the security to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood collection , opened in the Col@@ in the first je@@ ans of the family . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began to West@@ co , when he was in high school in my last years , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoping to pass their property to their children . &quot;
&quot; Luigi said often to me , that he never wanted the brethren to land in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , with Col@@ in asser@@ ted that Mark paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; says Paul &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in has returned very much , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 of Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the television stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS , to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case before the courts may be . &quot;
&quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to mo@@ urn and to move our family names through the dishes , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father did not know that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he is still hoping for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be past .
&quot; our matter will be resolved in the near future by the courts , &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot;
&quot; tr@@ umps of new staff , is planning to restrict the media @-@ desc@@ ends of the President . &quot;
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly may actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
Poli@@ tico reports that the new staff head of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including the reports of the news media - in the hope of keeping the boss on a similar course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of the White House , met at his first working day by leading employees , he set a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House which he refused : poor information that got into the hands of the President . &quot;
&quot; Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brie@@ f@@ ings , because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to count Tr@@ ump by monitoring its media di@@ ons .
&quot; President Tr@@ umps relationship with television dates back for decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television inheritance is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if candidate was upset because of an unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of places that were to convince , &quot; said the former election consultant Sam Nun@@ berg in February to Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key to hold Tr@@ umps Twitter @-@ habit under control , according to six former electoral campaign , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a ste@@ er praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tr@@ umps Twitter @-@ habit was ever &quot; under control , &quot; is ridiculous . &quot;
perhaps these combat officers know something we don &apos;t know - that Tr@@ umps T@@ we@@ ets would have included more car@@ ni@@ tion without their interventions .
we will probably never experience something about the twe@@ ets which Tr@@ ump did not send .
&quot; if his employees had made it a few times , anger can hold off from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; however , no one has consistently prevented it that tr@@ ump controversi@@ es comes out . &quot;
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House which consist of compet@@ ed parties , repeatedly trying to advance their own agenda by promoting Tr@@ ump material , which may promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May with the fon@@ dness of the consultants , the president for strategic reasons , without doubt . &quot;
this was an example which was described by Reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press cuts , especially those with sh@@ ame@@ ful le@@ aks and that he will find out where these come from . &quot;
&quot; this happened in the end of February when someone was accused of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ tar@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ vocation by Charles C. Johnson , who was the source behind a he@@ ap of being of le@@ aks in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was sc@@ anned out of Twitter because of Shi@@ kan@@ en , or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accus@@ ations in the past and vo@@ ke them . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and started to ask employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then rod of Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the Tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same for three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
Me@@ ist@@ ad@@ dictions criminals get Post of Euro@@ pol
&quot; the address is unknown , the help of the population is praying and hoped for . &quot;
the police are ma@@ iled all over Europe this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards at dangerous criminals on the run .
&quot; as the addresses of the searched s@@ qui@@ ties are not known according to , the information from the population is hoped and praying . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , which is followed by the &quot; &quot; Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; calendar of winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences would have shown that many volati@@ le jobs were hiding , it meant by Euro@@ pol . &quot;
one have compiled 21 post@@ cards for selected criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ asis to have been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
&quot; 36 of the online gestures could not be arrested so far , at least eleven of them were transferred to the website according to the publication on the website . &quot;
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est house@@ holders of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travelers on war foot , who have negotiated one of the municipality of broken dit@@ ch to claim a field in front of their manor houses . &quot;
&quot; the travellers have par@@ ted their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy road from Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of transportation , after being ki@@ cked out only in May , without being de@@ ported from one by the Council to prevent their accidents . &quot;
&quot; the tactical group found a gap in the defense units and pressed their vehicles through a section , which remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way . &quot;
&quot; angry residents have pus@@ hes the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it is &quot; useless &quot; to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous residents said , &quot; They are there on Monday night after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath , where they cast stones on the pas@@ sers . &quot;
the Council must be forced by shame to implement into action as it was useless when dealing with the problem .
the travellers were moved in May and are now moved back .
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; the council of Birmingham know how to handle it , by keeping long walks in order to protect its parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I am not happy , continue to pay my com@@ dest@@ ress if the Council cannot even stop . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of who wanted to be called , said , &quot; It &apos;s ridiculous , we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be lo@@ oted from another round . &quot;
the numbers have been lifted up this time and you even saw a horse in the parking area .
&quot; a spokes@@ person at the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to support our motives collection , it is very important that as many inhabitants as many citizens are able to report a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must prove , when we present our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise will be enjoyed .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ l is being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the Hotel Birken@@ hof by the then ambience business company in the 13th of April 2014 , around 30 000 nights were lost per year and also revenue from the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the autumn of 2014 , there was dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who arrived in the County , the hotel building offered as a gathering place for the controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by placing a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the council .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Upper Grand@@ master Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and said back then from serious interested parties in the house .
he should reserve the right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ Hotels with Head of Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a House of the three @-@ star Plus category among the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; in the former Hotel Birken@@ hof have been in front of the entrance for a longer period , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear , what extensive renov@@ ations are made . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils have been demol@@ ished , blankets to the part built , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms removed . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be re@@ done in the black @-@ style style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large heated showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , there are new windows built . &quot;
&quot; everything was later &quot; &quot; beautiful &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expressed . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewelry piece off . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room include the facilities . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but on a higher level of downtown , empha@@ sizes Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms is located wide , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; individual holiday makers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism direc@@ tor Michael Kr@@ ause it has already led to such s@@ acks .
the performances of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investments in demand , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants not to specify exactly . &quot;
&quot; under a million euros , he expects . &quot;
&quot; also , the outdoor facilities are brought to the foreground , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is publicly available from the restaurant that is publicly available . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : us @-@ Special Representative to the Grand Jury a
&quot; in the Russia @-@ affair by US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Special Representative to Robert Mu@@ eller is supposed to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury for a report . &quot;
&quot; the panel included the work over the past few weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; . &quot;
the paper led the step as a sign that mu@@ eller can be extended and intensified .
&quot; the sender of CN@@ N reported that there are already first inv@@ itations of the body , in connection with a meeting between the resi@@ du@@ ous son and a Russian approach . &quot;
&quot; US intelligence agencies acc@@ use the Krem@@ lin for long , to be targeted in the presidential election in 2016 . &quot;
Mu@@ eller examines whether there was dis@@ agreements between the m@@ umps of campaigns and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigation , several men should stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republi@@ can . &quot;
&quot; according to report , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ umps private and business environment among the magni@@ fier . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Representative Tr@@ ump spent personally to the center and seek the accus@@ ation if the President in the course of the affair may have obstruc@@ ted the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand Law@@ yers is to examine and decide this evidence in possible failure , and decide whether to be charged . &quot;
Grand j@@ uries are therefore also called charges .
mostly they are switched on when it comes to bigger and controversial cases .
the trial is always behind closed doors .
the panel can also be switched on by the Public Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Office to invite people to susp@@ end under E@@ id .
&quot; according to the transm@@ itter CN@@ N already pre@@ inv@@ itations are already issued , which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian approach . &quot;
people who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement called it in the report .
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. were also Tr@@ umps Consult@@ ant and in law @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his former election campaign Paul Man@@ a@@ fort .
&quot; right @-@ wing they said on Thursday night on Thursday , that the setting shows that Mu@@ eller does not go timi@@ d in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on the end to decide on collecting an indictment . &quot;
&quot; however , the establishment of the body at the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President on Thursday night took a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y Russia @-@ affair as campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia @-@ history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the subject will give the Democrats an opportunity to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about which they can talk . &quot;
&quot; his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in an opinion , he did not know anything about the establishment of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; this work is also usually working in secret , &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; the White House endor@@ se all measures , which accelerated the work of special instruction on &quot; fair &quot; fashion . &quot;
the former F@@ BI leader James Com@@ ey has told three times that not the president will be determined .
&quot; you have no reason to suppose that something changed , it meant in the explanation . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had been fired .
&quot; because of this re@@ pro@@ vocation , accus@@ ations were loud against tr@@ ump , he wanted to im@@ pe@@ de the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to have an adjustment of the investigation against the then national security advisor Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is under great pressure due to the investigation .
&quot; according to the representation of U.S. media , the White House gathered material against the Sonder@@ ators and his associates . &quot;
the weak@@ est spec@@ ulations about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller released .
&quot; unlike an independent special edition of Congress , like in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , the President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has found a position in which he theoretically could be fired at the ur@@ ging of the President of the Minister of Justice . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step but prevention . &quot;
&quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators created on Thursday by Thursday , after which the Special Representative could no longer be released . &quot;
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg is driving in Antar@@ c@@ tica
&quot; in the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has been solved by the scar@@ let size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is . &quot;
that was the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar@@ - and Maritime Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the more than a tri@@ l@@ lion tonnes heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers , big Kol@@ oss ham@@ lets are now north and will probably need two , three years until it mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometers of length and width of up to 50 km of one of the largest ice cream , the researchers have registered in the past three decades . &quot;
a danger for people does not go out of him .
&quot; to what extent of climate change has played a role in the overthrow of the ic@@ eber@@ gs , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; however , there has been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ put in the region for around 30 years , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact background . &quot;
according to many researchers this could be connected to the warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is swi@@ ms over the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks off .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula .
&quot; north of this treasure , the balance of wa@@ xing and abor@@ tion was dis@@ rupted a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete par@@ ental fe@@ is to fall there , writes AW@@ I @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m talking about the fact that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , as the pr@@ elo@@ ad has never withdrawn as far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ic@@ e@@ plate is under tension and could be dis@@ car@@ ded , if at a key point , there is a piece of bre@@ vity . &quot;
&quot; melting melt by Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg is not elevated to sea level , as they swim in the water and ice as much water as it does after melting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the de@@ pot leads to the fact that the glacier directly flows into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the level of level , but only in the low measure , the British research project for observation of the Antar@@ c@@ tica ( MID@@ AS ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is after AW@@ I data with almost 50 000 square kilometres the fourth quarter of the Antar@@ c@@ tica .
&quot; the passage from the mainland is up to 700 metres thick , on the front @-@ edge to the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks off regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and no direct connection to climate change is conscious , the ice sign is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most successful withdrawal from the beginning of records , &quot; &quot; confirmed he also . &quot;
&quot; under scientists may be controversial , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is going to grow again or long , and possibly collap@@ sed , &quot; said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even though these researchers will not lead the upheav@@ al of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg on climate change , so in recent decades , very many ice @-@ drops of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula are dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot;
this long bricks of the Antar@@ c@@ tica extends in the direction of South America .
&quot; according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice area of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has gone back to 28 000 square kilometers . &quot;
the decline has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has been war@@ med in the past 50 years by around three degrees and en@@ umer@@ ated to the areas where the temperature is fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ rigi@@ if at the staff
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy free jobs , the CD@@ U , from the employer association , calls to step out to become more attractive . &quot;
only shortly before the summer break the Kre@@ ist@@ ag opened up 41 new places in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the management of M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have their first working day after themselves .
the teaching @-@ places at the circle are obviously very popular .
around 6@@ 20 applications were listed for the places this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle is still lacking personnel to cope with the increasing demands and tasks . &quot;
at present there are still 50 non @-@ occupied jobs at the county of M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; amongst others doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration . &quot;
the CD@@ U would now like to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
the administration should work according to the desire of the parties &quot; a concept for personnel recovery and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term needs of specialists , but to work forward @-@ oriented of the applicants , it is said . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be based on the inside and the outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include a learning offensive , calling CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
&quot; for the circle has to do with personal problems , which you had not known earlier so . &quot;
other towns promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
the speech is given by a rule @-@ right &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot;
&quot; this includes a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ related due to the service . &quot;
&quot; so far , to action so that no longer places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ op@@ les , Leader of the CD@@ U , continues with his party beyond the common application . &quot;
he was already in@@ experienced in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a lazy surprise when he asked the personnel expenses publicly and the rest of the parties were aston@@ ished .
people want to be checked out that all opportunities will be checked out of the municipal association .
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the management of the trade unions should continue to be in cooperation with the circular cities - a house @-@ star@@ vation , &quot; said peoples . &quot;
&quot; to ensure the CD@@ U , the employees and officials to pay better than it is the collective bar@@ gaining for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money there is only if you change into a higher level that is oriented towards professional years . &quot;
&quot; however , the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years . &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be set up in which to take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution Act . &quot;
&quot; not least by the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ tor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy stresses the tone to NGO migrants at li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs , the li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they may not continue to continue if they are unable to comply with new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not submit a new Code of Conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German relief organization &apos; youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , because whose team worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilitated the illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the relief organization , which has only been in operation since a year , refused to express themselves to detailed preliminary allegations of the Italian pro@@ secutor &apos;s Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are sorry that we are unable to operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; the organisation said in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can collect all accus@@ ations which are currently collected , only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had the boat from &apos; youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , who supervis@@ es I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that the occupation of the din@@ gh@@ y migrants will take on board , which can directly be supplied by human traffi@@ ckers , and that the smug@@ gler can ab@@ duc@@ ts them , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting occurred , only 1,3 miles in front of the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the pro@@ secutor , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of alien@@ ating the authority of the Italian coastal guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Conduct , boats have to be seen as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , especially an Italian police officers , who supervis@@ es their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations , have so far been prepared to keep up to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; essential changes or disability &quot; of their b@@ ail@@ out actions . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates organisation doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; Minn@@ iti spoke by now that the number of migrants arrived in Italy during the last weeks , the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and co @-@ operation with local citizens . &quot;
&quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month , about economic development initiatives and with Tsch@@ ad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that these countries leave in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
An@@ c@@ ages and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin Foreign post &quot; and two guest @-@ passenger met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in Northern Palat@@ inate , for four days to enjoy watching and sightseeing . &quot;
there were three free guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome Extra .
the first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards for Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there are view@@ points , partly to towers , of which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ alz forest and the up@@ stream levels . &quot;
in between there were always a longer en@@ closure for the long triumph@@ s .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the People &apos;s Festival .
&quot; again , viewpoint at the viewpoint , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate An@@ dri@@ des . &quot;
in the last two days many al@@ timeter had been said again .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and clo@@ ak were welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim at@@ me@@ ten the bi@@ ker in the open @-@ air condition of healing Sole .
also new town was controlled .
&quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometers and nearly 4@@ 500 al@@ ti@@ meters , the group had met the Pf@@ alz forest from its best - sporty and cultural . &quot;
console instead of grass - Bundesliga ge@@ ars up for e @-@ sport
sit the sport stars in future in front of computer games instead of struggling with wind and weather over the stadium ?
&quot; fact is : e @-@ sport has long become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gases . &quot;
they have also recognized the first Bundes@@ li@@ ga@@ des who are increasingly involved in this field .
&quot; the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded in mid @-@ July an e @-@ sport department and two professionals for the computer game of FIFA 17 under contract took place . &quot;
&quot; we hope to enth@@ use this brand new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Management Jo@@ chen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is certain that on this train , he is still a number of associations . &quot;
&quot; on the coming weekend , the Football World@@ cup will organize FIFA in London the first &apos; Interactive Club World Cup , in which the gam@@ ers of various clubs can compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven quali@@ fies . &quot;
also Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ olds , that young people are still going into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs were trying to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract , one could be much more often present on these markets than once in the year to send the Bundes@@ Ligur@@ ian border to Asia once a year . &quot;
what is it exactly ?
&quot; in the e @-@ sport , computer games like &quot; League of Le@@ gends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or even the soccer simulation of FIFA on competition level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , like in normal sport as well , Li@@ ves are established , in which the pros compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in Asia , E @-@ sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it all about a real sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly ordinary . &quot;
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ous has changed a long time with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is a competitive and many biological and physical responses to show that one can also find in classical sport - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress levels , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it will need cognitive abilities , a technical and tactical understanding and a quick response capability . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition . &quot;
&quot; the f@@ itte players is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , F@@ rob@@ ous sees also problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a subject . &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult to perform at online games , and in the scene missing the structures of classical sports . &quot;
&quot; in positive results , the scientists lifts the high integral effects of e @-@ sport . &quot;
&quot; the players are on the road internationally , this is like a large global family , there are no intercultural barriers . &quot;
a study of corporate counsel@@ ing Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; in fact , in Germany 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot;
sales should be at 130 million in three years .
&quot; against the nearly 2,@@ 4 billion euro of the soccer league , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte advisor . &quot;
international are many countries already on .
big markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez participate in the US team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood @-@ actor Ashton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in e@@ Sport @-@ competitions Uni@@ kr@@ n .
even in Europe there is a lot .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as a lesson , says F@@ rob@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and France the soccer acade@@ mia , according to D@@ utt , are now committed to set up an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison with Germany , V@@ f@@ B executive board is explained . &quot;
&quot; to fall in nostal@@ gia , and to clarify the ancient times , it is no longer sufficient . &quot;
&quot; it is about preserving the tradition of the association , but at the same time the company will focus on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ sed world , &quot; &quot; means also D@@ utt . &quot;
&quot; you cannot make it clear that only football stays like it was always . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter because of the texts , the Con@@ rad Roy has been pushing for su@@ icide , &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years because she encourages her boyfriend through texts and calls for su@@ icide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind G@@ it@@ ters and five years were exposed to par@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; Carter was condemned by Con@@ rad Roy June , due to the casual killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday during his hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free up to the appeal .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered in a psych@@ ic disease . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red pants and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter as with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down @-@ directed eyes , when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have brought Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; the pro@@ secutor said to the court . &quot;
she ended his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it has not shown any repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ te lawyer said , it is an &quot; terrible circum@@ stance , which they completely de@@ pl@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz told , however , he did not find that her &quot; age or maturity , or even their spiritual disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a pro@@ secutor has read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , the said that there is &quot; no day when I don &apos;t mo@@ urn the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want it to be proud of me and as I go with everything , I try , despite all my pain that we will carry for eternity with us , to be there for his sisters , &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will be pro@@ secuted by the knowledge &quot; &quot; I will never take part in the wedding of her brother or would be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer the only person to have , with whom I was working each day since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep in my life for the rest of my life . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to put a legal preced@@ ent as there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to commit to another su@@ icide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon oxid@@ ation in a car in 2014 .
&quot; the case , national attention attracted to himself , after Car@@ ters text statements revealed that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging on the spring from a building , erst@@ e@@ che yourself , I do not know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she was sent in two weeks before his death , while he was on holiday with his family . &quot;
&quot; looking ahead of his su@@ icide , she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad and &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is to turn the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot;
&quot; judge Mon@@ iz told that Carter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy , and ruled that she could profit by any press from the case . &quot;
the case has the legal opinion shared .
&quot; the few who defended Carter , was part of Amanda Kno@@ x , who was sentenced in 2007 because of the murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted of two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Chi@@ me : learning from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run for me at the Audi cup as captain was not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern cons@@ ented to the Con@@ fed Cup winner a great season - Extra motivation was not .
&quot; what was different in his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ me immediately , even if the extra piece of garments was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but since far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he took the bur@@ dens on the arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer did not have it announced , &quot; &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as a Bavaria @-@ captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the one could have been able to run better than with the 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign of the coach could give me something like this .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was chosen among youth players , debit cards and just out of the holiday of the existing C @-@ El@@ f as a player leader , but he was chosen . &quot;
&quot; sugar@@ s are all distributed at the dearest to those , which you want a lot to keep in mood . &quot;
&quot; who therefore was chosen to make the legacy of Lah@@ m , a small extra motivation can only use good . &quot;
Kim@@ ber@@ i confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player wants to take on responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
&quot; to the right behind , this is now its position , the white ties of the arm did its rest . &quot;
&quot; and in fact , Kim@@ ber@@ ated me in this start @-@ formation like the one who can also take the rest of the one in his hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ played tro@@ upe . &quot;
&quot; he had the view of the whole , while many others were busy with himself . &quot;
&quot; Vid@@ al thus , to play its missing fitness ( fol@@ te hardly ) ; Renato San@@ ches therefore , get out of the performances of the Asia @-@ travel ( fol@@ te only partly ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus not to fall ill in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
that is all quite good .
&quot; in addition to Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both acted sovereig@@ n@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; the nam@@ ach@@ ingly occupied Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , moreover , sweet@@ ness was successful even in the building construction a few times successful . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy gave the fact that the result was &quot; &quot; not that way we had hoped for . &quot;
&quot; however , he also showed a decent performance at the debut . &quot;
&quot; shift shift , Tem@@ po@@ ison : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as un@@ seen , this Bayern @-@ World is still living for the new reception , one looked after the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , Ru@@ dy was not one or two , but surely six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ ber@@ i passed after a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new fellow @-@ players .
&quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from the south : &quot; &quot; what goes here , I have now remembered . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria you just have to win any game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after all , he does not have to teach the new one more . &quot;

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ arian minister : economy lo@@ bt Wis@@ dom Tempo
&quot; it is often in@@ conci@@ li@@ atory , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , and Economic Minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; this is reflected in more than one year , in which the new Minister of Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and bl@@ amed the old minister at the same time .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ bal Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing takes up the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all blocked . &quot;
the biggest K@@ ehr@@ er sees Nat@@ us in the infra@@ structural politics : the bridge between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s primary list .
&quot; this year , the Ministry of ministry will be hoping for a plan@@ ing process until 2005 the building should be right . &quot;
a role in the country &apos;s plans will also play the West@@ um@@ eration in Tri@@ er which is in the urgent need of the federal government .
&quot; the aim is to take the route in December 2020 , says the Ministry of Education in Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us looks at this a sign for regional , but internationally competitive companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) , as of Wis@@ sing , stimulated by the wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the employed German wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing have an open ear for people who want to start their own company , the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Cra@@ fts Tri@@ er sees an additional incentive for young trainees , Managing Director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
provided is a premium of 1000 euros for the examination of the master examination and 2500 Euro when graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the mastery .
but the home@@ work @-@ list for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned street construction are fast facts to create , at the same time , l@@ acked the country the necessary staff , says Jan Bell &apos;s , chief executive leader of the Chamber of Commerce Tri@@ er . &quot;
&quot; 56 new engineers , who wants to adjust Wis@@ sing in regional mobility , are currently only 29 positions . &quot;
the Chamber of Industry calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
CD@@ U @-@ fac@@ vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the invoice and the country invested in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less than proposed in the conservation of national roads .
&quot; in addition , Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the previous broad@@ band construction is also in the country . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had only evaluated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the note of 3,4 . &quot;
it compl@@ ained about deck @-@ breaking internet connections and break@@ downs .
ex @-@ Economic Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting around the board of wind power plant per wind .
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke on April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where they already returned to the field after four months due to in@@ consist@@ encies . &quot;
&quot; Audi is to change 85@@ ,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face an opposition campaign . &quot;
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer the software to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW leader said , the company is the opinion that &quot; there are intelligent options as limited restrictions , &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to ban or restrict . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there are three million Mercedes cars to be modified in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European automobile manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the observ@@ ance of rules for carbon emissions .
&quot; however , the nit@@ rogen oxi@@ des that em@@ itted diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ o@@ genic and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of automobile manufacturers to install plants for neutr@@ alisation of the extraction of diesel vehicles , take also too what makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful car firms and ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen to regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ down devices , which could regulate emissions , if a car has been tested , but return to normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics in the engine development of Audi in Germany was arrested .
&quot; former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and might be placed in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigation in Volkswagen , after the authorities have accused of having installed a system to deal with emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that was concentrated on the United States . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the study could involve Volkswagen heavy burden : the luxury automobile manufacturers contributes significantly to the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and the laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ dill@@ o was time @-@ wise one of the most recently published Carto@@ on pointer , the cel@@ enn@@ es of his figures are his trademark . &quot;
also with 85 marks the Argent@@ inian and works on a film .
&quot; his message : laugh , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
gu@@ ill@@ ar Mor@@ dill@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first few years as an artist , he suggested itself as a sign of luck for happiness cards . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when he lost my job , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris they managed to be a breakthrough : with the release of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China I found Mor@@ dill@@ o many fans .
over and over again the artists of cities be inspired .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ dill@@ o @-@ figures tum@@ ble in drawings with the shooting tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning he is still sitting at the drawing , and works for nearly ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; over calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush animals and watches are continuing to find his dro@@ l@@ ish figures still much spread worldwide . &quot;
for six years he has been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures .
&quot; the main person in the movie &quot; &quot; Crazy Island &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los at any test@@ es animal in his drawings - that has a thou@@ sand@@ wich function as a counter @-@ player . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which is supposed to come to the cinema wall . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they say , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ dill@@ o . &quot;
the script will not be written by him .
&quot; that is why he rather put on the TV series , which , like its original desig@@ nations , wor@@ dless . &quot;
lav@@ ender of climate change threatened by climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lav@@ ender is rec@@ alled because of the conditions of drought and due to illness transferred to insects , what scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , Expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CR@@ IE@@ PP@@ AM in Provence said : &quot; &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively threatened because the plant in recent years has brought the effects of climate change , which has brought much less rain in spring and fall much more in autumn . &quot;
this has effects on the life of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small ornam@@ ental , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf @-@ thread transm@@ its , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
&quot; lav@@ ender oil attracts not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very much sought for perf@@ ume and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant drilling with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; among the solutions that are considered , include better water distribution and the slo@@ wing of the dark from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties , which are more resistant to drought . &quot;

the assassination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly paper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce meet usually on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ ceas@@ eless drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
it has been told to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what is more secure : they should take their children to the office , who were the target of an attack with Gran@@ ads , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; safety experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ porter to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , perceptions and abdom@@ en . &quot;
&quot; there are drug policies , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of the secret list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no resting break from violence , and while throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are frequent , more and more journalists are standing : at least 25 , since President Enri@@ que Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to in December 2012 have been subject to attack and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven states this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , its editors and their inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be journalist , Val@@ dez wrote in one of his many books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence is felt deep , although its presence is present everywhere - a large picture of Val@@ dez , which shows its medi@@ um@@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; depends on the facade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , wear T @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their nightmare , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although in 2010 a probe of the Federal Convention was established , in order to process the cases of journalists , it introduced only two criminal proceedings according to the committee for the protection of journalists . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of murder , each year associated with drug trafficking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely put forward to justice . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , even though they are outra@@ geous and even though the terrain is still slo@@ wed down . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of safety is little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very silly to waste my time at this workshop , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know this , we mis@@ trust all . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the provincial capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed to drive a few blocks away , before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - the &quot; &quot; T@@ wel@@ ded river &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius went away in his car away and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two adults .
rum@@ ors tend to walk freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but to the theme of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest in the past year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ lements of the country as rival@@ ing fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the streets or that the cemetery is full of figured out two @-@ story removal of plastic reg@@ isters , which are larger than many houses for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget about a minute that there is a state of &quot; rest , &quot; if only a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; initially , in February the publication of a interviews with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival@@ ing cart@@ ons in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have made anno@@ yed the sons , suspected gang@@ members bought each copy of the output as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second fault was in this , Val@@ dez does not impose on this , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of a different newspaper which had published the same story to leave the country into its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its kill@@ ings is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues im@@ itate that he would always be there .
he was active as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este when he joined with five colleagues for the foundation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism , without encounter@@ ing the anti @-@ do@@ w@@ ry problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with the time , the paper served a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting , and revenues and publicity . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porter loved it , hard apt investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories , which nobody else to treat . &quot;
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever it lead . &quot;
he volunte@@ ered that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J @-@ award . &quot;
&quot; drug trade in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV in October last October . &quot;
&quot; you have to take the task that falls to you as a journalist , either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what did you do in view of so many things ... why did you not say what was going on ?
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce @-@ Team mixed Val@@ dez , the spa@@ wn @-@ bird , who was like a do@@ ckers , the friend , the generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
you trust in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite to the office , go and sit there at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now , ask them : was his love for routine his destruction ? &quot;
&quot; his death also has forced them to question their own assumptions on how they can perform their work best and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they do not like it , if you are dealing with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ a@@ ways and cross @-@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it smells , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing happens with Javier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer in Sin@@ alo@@ a , as not as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a poison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative smug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home . &quot;
the landscape changes constantly .
&quot; in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly there were no mobile phones allowed . days before has been known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two poli@@ c@@ emen were seeking protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the local government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class area of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the poli@@ c@@ emen , which the governor himself referred to as not trustworthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountain scenery , where the drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
for the issue of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has put on three main stories .
there was the assassination of the brother of the former box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the government spending , which focused on the hometown of the governor . &quot;
&quot; and there was a group that in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the pro@@ secutor , led a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write , which everyone in town knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug retailers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porters from public records , that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy leader who ruled the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , who ruled out almost the whole century all political planes . &quot;
recently several Pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ car@@ eless cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this pub , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man came to a military takeover . &quot;
&quot; just a few months before , the readers have seen the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; earlier we had already knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slim body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers , devoted to the mor@@ de of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected , activists in the name of the press . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ apped up a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning , because of another journalist to the Office of the Public Pro@@ secutor . &quot;
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its .
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become vo@@ ci@@ fer@@ ous by having written in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on walking and constructions . &quot;
&quot; this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez went away in Washington and tried to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; in a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a , on the day after the murder of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to pronoun@@ ce journalists and bring it to it because they said the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has therefore asked that she is once again divided by the government , because it is concerned that her anger has violated their objectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico by organised crime , involved in government officials and a equal society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security workers who have organised crime among a blan@@ ket . &quot;
&quot; last year , the media @-@ whales group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; was assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials over the past year . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico , you think , because they want you to dis@@ proportionate the mouth , &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a de@@ terr@@ ent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; your body was found along with a note that supposedly signed by the Z@@ etas de Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer stat@@ s and ear@@ phones in addition to their separated head .
&quot; some branches have chosen to include , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te at the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua for the assassination of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ros@@ lav Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
others continue on how it did El Man@@ ana from Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo following the assassination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they are still watching the roads and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted how it was apparently murdered by the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , which was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain back and continue the work , it is a daily dance with risky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be Po@@ ets , gives it to that the drug @-@ trafficking promised him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I was re@@ porter . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat at the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer , than once all their phones began to reach . &quot;
a number of sliding @-@ not@@ aries with band@@ ages and security guards near the bathing resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed deaths .
the war continues to escal@@ ate as it was promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the bro@@ wn@@ stone edge they released the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce about mobile phones .
the title page had to be changed on the next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ els in the vicinity - another shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers , the guards held to see if they were in readiness . &quot;
if they were afraid they didn &apos;t show it .
&quot; under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , the Mittel@@ finger was visible for quite Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed its traces . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if on the same day when Javier was murdered , the practic@@ ant asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used to so@@ ften its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue if also a fri@@ ghtening .
&quot; now , researchers have found that the first findings of an incredible nas@@ horn of a Canadian mountain job has been received so well that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa der Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
&quot; it was so well preserved that they could even find that its char@@ tered skin of red@@ dish was brown - and they said they could have had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; was referred to as &quot; the ar@@ du@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r din@@ osau@@ r , who ever was found , and one of the best din@@ os@@ aur@@ s specimens of the world . &quot;
&quot; fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the chal@@ k time between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; his incredibly well preserved condition has researchers that describe it as &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; , &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ aters is the best preserved fossil fuel of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he was born on 21 March 2011 in Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something which was missing from the surrounding rocks at the board , and decided to see more accurately . &quot;
the Fossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy oil cl@@ adding . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be un@@ veiled . &quot;
&quot; if you only blin@@ king a little with the eyes , you could almost believe it has slept , &quot; said the captain Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist in the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum , where the creature is visible . &quot;
&quot; it is going to be more than one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of din@@ os@@ aur@@ s - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this plant fres@@ her , although he is covered with an arm@@ or and a changing shell , probably by meat fres@@ cos din@@ os@@ aur@@ s was threatened . &quot;
&quot; the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age , in order to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technology which is known as opposed to many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have allowed themselves to better mix in its surroundings and to so@@ ften its enemies , say , what suggests that it was threatened by larger din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ r has been head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now in the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ ch@@ elli after the Muse@@ um@@ ste@@ alth Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours . &quot;
&quot; the ast@@ ounding conservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ aments about his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ aded , a common defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ sh@@ aded is common , the results are surprisingly , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it points to the fact that the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s was hun@@ ted out of sufficient pressure by meat @-@ eating din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , that the evolution of the confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ad@@ ation - think of deer , z@@ ebras or gar@@ rison - are much smaller and hur@@ ting than prey , which sign@@ alized that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ r was exposed to a real struggle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ ory behavior on a massive , strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s show how dangerous the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s predat@@ ors have to have been &quot; , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis organic compounds in their skins also shows that the skin of the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s red brown .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal on hints about his life , including its fourth Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes to find out what it eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s died when he died , into a river and went out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alberta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably more widespread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really not@@ e@@ worthy , because it is completely covered with con@@ vent skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the beast , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal is almost exactly the same as in the early chal@@ k time .
&quot; you do not need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just have a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time when giant ther@@ opo@@ den , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ os@@ aur@@ s that stood on two legs , the earth were dra@@ fted . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tonnes heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings in the scientific journal Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology appear , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was buried after the death in the sea and in mud m@@ um@@ i@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he was born on 21 March 2011 in Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the pre @-@ adjusted din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is complete from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and wei@@ ghed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long peaks that ra@@ ined from his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ aters was curved by the western Canada , until a flooded flow into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s kept his arm@@ our in an exquisite detail .
&quot; the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this particular specimen are so well preserved , that the skin remains still hol@@ lowed hol@@ lows along the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
&quot; like Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &quot; rare as a profit in the Lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more confusing it becomes . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied Res@@ et of the skin still cover the b@@ umpy tank panels , which carry the skull of the beast . &quot;
&quot; his right @-@ foot foot is on his side , his five fingers are split up . &quot;
I can count the scales in his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
violent accident on Thursday evening at A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous los@@ ers , kilometres long and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , the late Thursday afternoon at a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age has been injured approximately 20 people . &quot;
&quot; after the first data of the police were at 17.@@ 00 p.m. between the connecting Adel@@ z@@ hausen und O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ circle Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm of just 30 vehicles , including even trucks . &quot;
the exact number of publishers were first mentioned before .
&quot; it handle easy to medium serious injury , said a pol@@ ye@@ is@@ ran@@ cher . &quot;
a big b@@ anded of b@@ ail@@ out vehicles was at the accident place .
the A@@ 8 was completely locked in direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich there was a around ten kilometres long back@@ rest .
&quot; as an A@@ Z re@@ porter reports , it was also on the way to massive disability - with numerous G@@ aff@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; the fire@@ men have noted the marks of the vehicle , which now have been received with sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. there was another second accident on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between a car otran@@ smit@@ ters and a car .
a rescue @-@ helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or you have deep@@ ened in his work and has just an ingeni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
&quot; comes the creation , and awak@@ ens an un@@ ison , or irrit@@ ates the lift in the middle of the work@@ flow . &quot;
check @-@ card control .
but the times of the inter@@ rup@@ tions are gone soon .
Deutsche Bahn tests the creator @-@ free card control .
you simply confirm via mobile phone that you have taken his place and de@@ valued the ticket .
currently a test run running on two routes .
&quot; if the offer comes , we expand it . &quot;
&quot; it will then be available at many other remote traffic routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; said a train speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; is called the train the ticket de@@ valuation without creation .
&quot; in order to be able to use , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - which is already the most passengers already do .
&quot; you also have to purchase it via the app of the railway , the DB navig@@ ator , which anyway is the easiest type of ticket sales . &quot;
and at least one needs a seat reservation .
&quot; for the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works so : one clim@@ bs in the train , calling the ticket under &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
with the test customers then a button for electronic de@@ valuation .
the traction managers get on their mobile devices a message that Tim@@ g@@ ast X is located in the train and has taken the booked seat .
&quot; comes the traction manager at the card control in place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already a worth@@ less online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; check in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn is to use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; those who relaxed without ticket control should be travelling through our train services , check out the DB navig@@ ator just yourself . &quot;
&quot; this allows the passengers to make their travel time on the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Management Board of DB correspondence . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; anyone who runs by train , knows that besides delays and missed the driving card checks for the largest sle@@ eves . &quot;
&quot; in any case , in any case , one of the fellow travelers do not need all the documents that are needed for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document that you have to point out .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between traction managers and chassis , which leads to poor ath@@ mosph@@ ere or large space and delays in controlling your own tickets and at the end the time takes care of taking care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test clients can use the new service .
and that only at the ICE ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same track are not activated .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken to its core .
&quot; just one day after having arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis in the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment which she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled across a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and it still is on the street , &quot; says it there . &quot;
&quot; confused , as no one else had posted the information on their feed , she finished Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on its tim@@ eline .
&quot; the r@@ apper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white poli@@ cem@@ an in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed live , live . &quot;
he sted a picture of bro@@ wns le@@ blo@@ os that was stretched on the road and would stay there four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; thought Fer@@ rell at itself . &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she put her cell phone away in order to return to T@@ we@@ et on people on the Can@@ field Drive later .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people , the crying , and by a man who claimed to be a sign with the in@@ scription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they watched a live feed on which a poli@@ cem@@ an was in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bell@@ ish dog .
&quot; in another video , she said that another poli@@ cem@@ an is his ri@@ f@@ le and cried out , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill you . &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; she remembered her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder that we have used to ourselves and that we can call them typical .
at that moment I felt joy@@ ous fro@@ st .
I was angry and wept .
you booked a flight back and went home next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she fet@@ ched her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; , &quot; in the cinemas from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and the protest , of love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the perspective of men that live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who bore a flower @-@ dress and a suitable crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had countless times in front of this morning &quot; over the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what she believed ? &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not correct .
&quot; I could not take her , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
that which happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
you have to know it and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it has to be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even though I have the luck to give her an experience , in which they personally experience no ec@@ lat@@ ant racism , it is no different from the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would turn her a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was a place against the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there was Fer@@ rell and her daughter connected with a local staff , lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags before and hal@@ ves to pass them to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly started to accept a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism was completely changed after the 9th of August , &quot; she said and notices that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in organizing . &quot;
it has all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her comra@@ de Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to only document &quot; document &quot; , &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came from Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; &quot; do you want to document , or try to find a story that you can exploit ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nourished by countless cases of people , often by white - in a community , benef@@ itted by their pain and resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and grew up , their voices do not cent@@ red and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for its activ@@ ism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt in@@ mates . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought the project closer to Fer@@ rell &apos;s project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; in the years following bro@@ wns . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not somebody who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , because I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ &apos;s experience - to show that it is with the movement &quot; not a Messiah leader , but about a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most revealed participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; consequently , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets show ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells life , as she loves and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and lau@@ ghed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability during this work and in the human@@ ization of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ells has repeated history the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify as a sul@@ ph@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in executive positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and we are constantly struggling with different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must wear the main last of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice , that &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it is clear that &quot; this is not a affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; where Fer@@ rell was selected as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who stir@@ red this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no coincidence , although it was at the forefront , because with a life on these crosses as a black , s@@ ow@@ l wife is so much at stake . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the cameras cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long gone , but the racial connections between the church and the police are continuing . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ age of a highway in a demonstration .
it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area they call their home : &quot; a mess . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they ple@@ dged themselves to a singing and she feels bound to this memory , since she went on the road three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains .

the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; People &apos;s Fre@@ y and Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while the one to say to the bit : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; that would be genuine &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi pers ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; size &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while advocates build on that a gallery attract more customers into the city , from which the rest of the business will benefit , the opponents of that then the pedestrian zone bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farm market hall is available in which 13 market market market offers its products . &quot;
with the start of construction work will be the conclusion .
&quot; the Gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new construction , namely for Bed@@ a square with possibility of sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; Simone Room : &quot; &quot; we have been buying a market hall for many years for many years . &quot;
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the owners have always been very happy . &quot;
also the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
&quot; we would like to have a chance to maintain this offer , even during and especially after the construction of the gallery . &quot;
in other cities there is this too .
&quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; whether direct market in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the amount of the rent . &quot;
but the new project might not be quite low in the new project . &quot;
Eva Kili@@ c : &quot; the Palace &apos;s Palace in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ or supermarket : I find it superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there are plenty of them in our city .
you see how many Lad@@ in stores are empty here - some have been empty for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a decent weekly market , it is all the more important that us at least receive the market hall . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods are fresh there , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is also very inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , Lad@@ in stores are reserved only from larger companies , because the r@@ ents are often not portable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; shame , specialty shops there is almost no more and what still exists , will probably even disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a mark@@ thalle does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market hall during the construction period ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even if the bit @-@ gallery is actually actually coming .
&quot; or does it get the spec@@ ter @-@ gallery before , all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just will not work .
&quot; a Shopping Center , which is empty , does not need any one . &quot;
&quot; in my view , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a farmers &apos; market there are many - as I find - sensu@@ ous construction projects in Bit@@ burg is no longer a place .
&quot; if the peasant market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable similarity : artist creates portrait with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost invisible from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ ppers and Haar@@ lem who have been sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excerpts from the prison of Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ st sent a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after they made publicly known diplomatic reports on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2nd , is called A Be@@ coming resem@@ blan@@ ce ( A suitable similarity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ w@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was united in technology , computer sciences and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and groundbreaking dis@@ si@@ ed , whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been extracted from the algorithms analysis of DNA , which was extracted from Mann@@ ing and look out of the 30 portraits , such as someone could interpret with these genom@@ ic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the in@@ dur@@ ent de@@ termin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has been spoken openly about the identification as a woman , was condemned in 2013 due to 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations against the Spi@@ on@@ age@@ Act , computer was and theft . &quot;
&quot; in jail , her picture was sup@@ pressed , so much that there was only one photo - a bas@@ hing , black @-@ white sel@@ fish@@ y , in the Mann@@ ing clearly sits at a driver &apos;s seat and has a plat@@ blonde Per@@ sp@@ acy - with which it was also associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of its 2012 @-@ Project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
therein the artist portrait of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts like cigarette smoke and che@@ wing g@@ um that extracts the DNA from the waste to create a picture of how these people could look like .
this was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; stated De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea , and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were exchanged at un@@ equal bril@@ liance that exchanged several letters in the course of two years .
&quot; they even created one of the Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated Com@@ ic &quot; Sup@@ pressed Images , &quot; which would fores@@ ee a future in which President Chel@@ ep@@ ad &apos;s ruling would convert and it would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing release was asked for seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome way of happ@@ enings . &quot;
&quot; there is also a little lowering and Star@@ kes at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads to war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the governmental camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able paths that he should actually fix , continue to de@@ fl@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about all these things , she said that &quot; things happen to happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; on the wall of the gallery under@@ written artistic statement , Mann@@ ing with her over@@ sized signature below ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end of the automatic frag@@ mentation , the basis of gender , race , sexuality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thou@@ sand@@ wich of Cs , and Gs and As , in pencil . &quot;
&quot; to show De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , by integrating the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ de after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) show how amazing , at least in biological ways , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully bring with , is that our genome is not taking care of who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , too . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in an own room is a page from the above com@@ ic no@@ vel@@ le . &quot;
she shows Mann@@ ing as she appears with a release @-@ out of hands in the hands of the discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ omas of the United States as King @-@ Kong .
&quot; if they make your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so never , never the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greeted me from Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ dly , when I speak about it . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it would be fores@@ een in the com@@ ic book , but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the center of the room by their own genom@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ren , which are like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; that was also focused on how everything was written in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ log@@ book with pencil were written . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed by Chelsea , like the movement , which hidden behind her liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of Oxford University of Oxford because of killing
&quot; a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University , who were sought as suspected a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries . &quot;
on Monday for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ ws ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) War@@ rant for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau .
&quot; the documents are saying that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died . &quot;
one of the police authority of Chicago release @-@ shared warning system states that the Lei@@ che has been discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call and came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim to several violations of his body .
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau was still explained in the place of the action for dead , and det@@ ective examining the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
La@@ its has been an extraordinary professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University in 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice Chairman of the University of University , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that La@@ ws has now been rob@@ bed and exp@@ elled from serving the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal case that is investigated by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ ans . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; an speaker at the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail explanation , that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help the US investig@@ ators in every conceivable manner . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shocked and want him to be shocked .
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urge the susp@@ ects firmly to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to loc@@ alise them , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the property management of the Grand @-@ Plaza @-@ Building , who had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip that had just happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , it is unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ ws and War@@ ren in the building were .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team from Grand Plaza published a statement to the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of moti@@ fs , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada roadmap in the near future &quot; - the Russian deputy prime minister Mut@@ ko
the Russian vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a specific stage of fulfillment of the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with Ukrain ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ ada roadmap was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the W@@ ada roadmap to meet the code , which describes the criteria for re@@ establishment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause Russia to worry about . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities approved the reported results of the approved by the W@@ ada by Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly accept dop@@ ing in Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we lead the study because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos &apos;s words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot;
&quot; talking to the Russian sales point R@@ sport at the beginning of the day S@@ mir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; he added S@@ mir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was ruled out in November 2015 in the wake of the dop@@ ing Sk@@ and@@ als by the W@@ ada of the carrying out of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
&quot; however , it was permitted to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the principal conductor of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;

start ups that will help your business will not be to become the next U@@ ber
Amy Sp@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys did not work .
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you desp@@ ise anonym@@ ity , some workers did not spend the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce H@@ air Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from outside for help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on the guard to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; through the creation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment , it allows companies to address surveys , specific groups and demographic events , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to deal with C @-@ Suite managers and contact the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ Bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your business ? &quot; &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools used by companies to measure employees . &quot;
saving them said they have better insight into what your employees think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat @-@ card of the company , which shows on a glance which units have most complaints and what managers have low authentication results - so that you can drill . &quot;
&quot; come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , so that you have not been involved in the next U@@ ber who has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ ale since then a former employee describes a blog post , who has been speaking to those who have spoken . &quot;
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t this wish is an overview of lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility .
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 according to the finance Technical website Let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behaviour , looked an increasing interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Conver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent businesses can send &quot; &quot; pulse &quot; &quot; surveys , confidential answers in real time and view the heat @-@ maps of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , with the staff to report a bad behaviour . &quot;
&quot; and if the principal leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the Reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that his employee is treated badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it may cost costly consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , workers &quot; floods , &quot; Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has been used convertible for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and processes and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; sooner if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a intimi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , told James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good way to follow the complaints from employees . &quot;
&quot; now since the company Conver@@ cent advocates , problems that were previously used by executives who have been hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or il@@ legitimate practice . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment &apos; , Vit@@ rano said the risk management Group from Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment , disputes . &quot;
&quot; companies began to take ethics , values and collaborators in 2002 ern@@ sters after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ ses because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron scandal , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it lasted until the &quot; Social Media came to her right , &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent provide your software as a service , and employ the company with recur@@ rent fees for use of their products . &quot;
&quot; it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital investors , which both start @-@ ups . &quot;
&quot; Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February by companies such as S@@ apphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the entire capital was raised to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners , bringing its entire financing to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of businesses , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more to expect from their jobs than before . &quot;
competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only bets .
the staff want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are glad to be able to feel within a company that pays off their voices and that the work you &apos;re doing is worth it , then they feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience with Link@@ ed@@ In , which is both Conver@@ cent as well as G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors achieve renovation when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well if employees are working and engaged .
&quot; when the analytics tools of third promise , commitment and commitment to increase employees , it is no wonder that you can find support . &quot;
the data about the employee involvement in the experts of the workplace culture is important .
&quot; however , the data is useless if the administrator of a company will not take action . &quot;
&quot; in fact , if a company asks employees after your feedback , it can have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , this can be dis@@ appointments and hon@@ eys . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company very much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow employees , &quot; &quot; Do you really hear me ? &quot;
would you like to take care of it ?
and whom do you don &apos;t care about why should I ?
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now performs monthly staff surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustrating employees , it was able to re@@ organize multiple teams in decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , capable of organising several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; on Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new insights on employees , and it hopes that in the long run this leads to a better bond of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; &quot; Vit@@ rano said . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose man , you will also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose clients , then you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood .
&quot; at 23 o &apos;clock , there is a lot of U@@ CL@@ A @-@ foot@@ ball@@ ers on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus . &quot;
some have moved their flo@@ or@@ ings and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these un@@ active minutes will be a lunch break .
&quot; players who are written to the summer courses are return to the weekly exercise , before returning to their audi@@ ts before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 to the water man center . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ ad@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the player and she actually extended her days - at least until the finale on Friday .
&quot; therefore , the first three training of U@@ CL@@ A should begin at 19 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to meet the already complete schedules of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than one day , at which the brood is moved to the beginning of the Camp@@ s almost one week after the last season , and during the summer school , during Mor@@ as six hours in West@@ wood practical exercises performed . &quot;
&quot; they should hold 18 exercises in the course of August 18 , before the beginning of the formal ad@@ missions for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ a said he supported the control change of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the player . &quot;
&quot; we put these enormous load on three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it out , they go forth , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think once we come up to Saturday and we will have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices as soon as the camp ends , what has been ki@@ cked out of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which is already bi@@ ased with pedest@@ al posts , no easy task . &quot;
&quot; brood @-@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a sp@@ ake one that could give it a problem as soon as those rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then set up an exercise . &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ and of an exercise it is a pretty good deal .
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not too much concerned about it .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensify facts in the fight against counterf@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false registr@@ ations to third parties and show their results under the original contribution then said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News .
&quot; the company said in an opinion on its website , that it will start with the use of updated machine methods to recognize possible false registr@@ ations and to send them to the fact @-@ audi@@ tor , which may display results of the billing examination from the original article . &quot;
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main points of the F@@ ake @-@ News so many believe that they also have influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , whereby French voters were flooded with false stories in May and Germany , and Germany supports a plan , after the social media networks , if it did not manage to eradic@@ ate h@@ asser@@ tive post@@ ings , as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany will be launched a test of new facts . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge , which stories of fac@@ eted parties will be challenged , people want more context to make @-@ founded decisions about what they read and share , &quot; says Sara S@@ u , Product man@@ ag@@ erin for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; and working on other changes to his news Fe@@ ed to reduce incorrect news . &quot;
creating a com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his recent past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ 1980 and 1980 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years turbulent history from its cozy seat at Be@@ wl River Valley in K@@ ent , now has now become an inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a cosmopolitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript from someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says we@@ h@@ tired . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; around the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney - Isaac Len@@ kie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes that was based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he found un@@ expect@@ edly . &quot;
&quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ b pressure on the side of a letter , which was written by a double @-@ agent in the 1700 &apos;s years that he worked for the Jacob@@ ins &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b pressure !
&quot; and letters always sm@@ elled after smoke , because at that time there was a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as if he himself would be . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is be@@ aten up with old papers , he will be supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England ( &quot; To be honest : I have been honest a little over four months &quot; ) , all this seems too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rhodes spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the Mongo@@ lian heads @-@ heads at the walls and the bottles which had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emigr@@ ated through the premises and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with Land@@ sc@@ iss@@ ors , gar@@ den@@ ies , and sometimes also with the artists working on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key , and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was first received in 2006 as the last one , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died . &quot;
&quot; when Rhodes arrived a decade later , the employee began just to take care of the archive which he described as &quot; &quot; hundreds of years , in which Ar@@ isto@@ cr@@ ates said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards who represent what he possessed , &quot; &quot; You could mean that country conflict would be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families . &quot;
guys , let everything go for its course ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on the broader base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a recording from a turmoil that appeared in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ fe Day of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rhodes . &quot;
the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start .
perhaps the two inter@@ connected ? &quot;
other stories are rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jesu@@ it &apos;s family that hid the family Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Reformation .
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; where the smug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell represented out of the 18th century , who filled his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later , when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family from Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be pretty much to make debts and spend money for things they could not afford .
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men solve their debt crown by rich old women - I place it to me as a he@@ ap well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise Er@@ bin@@ s . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his commitment in the castle , Rhodes is searching for other unique write experiences . &quot;
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about E@@ gre@@ y@@ ar@@ ki behind him , the terrain of a san@@ atorium on the early 20th century , which since then has been re@@ claimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to get ready again with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ en@@ kap@@ elle wrapped in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the restoration of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ en@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef has started their campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( introduced by Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; till Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz the logo and the slogan . &quot;
at the end of August there should be a celebration of the campaign a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ ver@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? , &quot; Ask the creators of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on its own yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; in essence , we are firmly convinced that we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; in action it comes to more than &quot; &quot; only &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it is said . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a sole promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique property . &quot;
&quot; finally , she stands in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
a mid @-@ digit amount allows the city of Bad Honnef its new umbrella brand and the campaign to cost .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August consul@@ ts in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) about pen@@ sion@@ ers and subsidies in the Officer &apos;s officer .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup .
&quot; the meeting did not take place in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the ministry of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the presidency of the Heads of Government now , the five Vice President and the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; in this way , civilians were in the Y@@ as in the number . &quot;
the government moves into the army in the military .
&quot; governor Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the Navy have been dropped . &quot;
&quot; since the failed cou@@ p , head Erdo@@ gan 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als have been fired . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdo@@ gan as a wire @-@ pul@@ lers of the coup . &quot;
&quot; for up to 4@@ 86 people , who must have been involved directly at the coup attempt , is being negotiated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup Erdo@@ gan was named after the overthrow of Erdo@@ gan as &quot; &quot; God present &quot; , &quot; as he give him the opportunity to clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really handle the army under control ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ hairy in the military headquarters . &quot;
&quot; in the Staff Staff , there are concerns over an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which among other things manifest themselves in the lifting of the head of the head of Sol@@ dat@@ as , wrote the paper . &quot;
in any case the big cle@@ ann@@ ess in the army and the security forces goes on .
&quot; in the middle of July Erdo@@ gan by decree continued by further 7@@ 3@@ 95 state fires , including 2@@ 303 poli@@ c@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed like Erdo@@ gan run the military .
the gener@@ als sooner than the actual men of the country .
three times put@@ ted them in appeal to their role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the world @-@ state authority .
&quot; after his election in 2002 Erdo@@ gan returns the power of the military step by step , not least by calling for the reform@@ ism of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is specifically targeted by the armed forces of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; , a particular non @-@ called officer who sought after the coup , sought out of fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be in a few years &quot; full of extremis@@ ts and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to meet that , such a development could not be cold . &quot;
&quot; anyway , in the alliance to the pur@@ ge doubt , there is doubts about the operational availability of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say NATO @-@ diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited from the media . &quot;
&quot; he fores@@ ees to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on visa for a perpet@@ ual work permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Re@@ public@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill &apos;s draft should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this Act will reduce poverty that increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ payers , and will do so by changing the way citizens from other countries of Green Cards will be issued . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will be the candidate who will speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot;
the ministry wants to reserve the track for the climb of the race
&quot; again and again , over the past few months passed over the future of the racing climb , it should go very fast . &quot;
&quot; even before the end of the year , at the landing stage , the tourist railway is going to be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the racing climb in the long term , the traffic of traffic should begin on the track according to the traffic of traffic . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order and move the route to Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is devoted to this especially for the tourism important connection , &quot; stated transport @-@ secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
&quot; the cost for the repairs of the route , he added to about 2.5 million euros . &quot;
&quot; from this sum , the country over@@ take 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on which the shuttle will also be ordered in the future by the state , will currently be final , stated S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the ministry and the south @-@ ür@@ ingen train as a operator can agree on the technical details already .
&quot; this means the roadmap that tra@@ ded vehicles and quality standards , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the race of the race shuttle will be ordered on December 2017 .
the racing car shuttle is a particular especially popular rail link between the railway stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; in the course of a pilot company , in the course of a pilot company , the distance of sufficiently many people will be used to order it again in the future . &quot;
the route is also heavily di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the rise of sex @-@ robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it is not yet to be crazy , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex @-@ robots are currently a big thing .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ zed professor for robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at She@@ ff@@ ield University and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take its rise seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of ni@@ pp@@ le and type of fingers . &quot;
&quot; people make themselves fun about it but the companies deliver lots of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key with the release of his new report . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ bs have developed from its infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone scal@@ p which is warm to the artificial intelligence which is achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adapt his robot correspon@@ d@@ ingly to his beliefs &quot; &quot; and choose everything from the eye color of the robot by the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it is still disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities , &quot; which would have a Step@@ ford @-@ woman to be progressive . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ bs have developed to robot@@ ic with a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appealing , such as bulk soli@@ ds . &quot;
and then there is still the true companion Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robots with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah . &quot; who conve@@ ys the impression of relap@@ sing and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; s@@ warming up the site from True Hol@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; so do they like what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you like , etc . &quot;
in the course of the day her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; it can be tired , fixed to conversation , or it can be &quot; in mood . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the inferi@@ or female properties , when you go a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluc@@ tance ) Far@@ rah is in@@ quiet one of the most . &quot;
&quot; on his website true True Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibration , why can men then have no ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; it is on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex . &quot;
their origin and increasing sophistic@@ ation point out a darker and deeper understanding of our culture towards a withdrawal from the ideal equality of gender equality towards a desire for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as an optional en@@ core .
&quot; most men will of course not hold a sex robot , and while the FR@@ R notices its rising popularity , they still remain on the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what per@@ me@@ ates out of the boundary zones , can be in terms of the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; many people are not stran@@ gely or insul@@ ting , until they have the free market for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; there is however a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots emerge in a time where the rights of women are threatened , in which there is a president in the White House who has master@@ ed women sexually attacked . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ terr@@ ent aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the hum@@ bling body and the extinct eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but in the moment this does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots consists of making a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( although with Por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
they want to make their pe@@ ers that they feel human and im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots represent no real women . &quot;
they cannot separate yourself from your companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or a background history , nothing that could distur@@ b to independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission . &quot;
differently expressed : you are counterf@@ eit slaves .
or to express it in the speech session of 2017 : ma@@ ids
dre@@ umps of great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the essence of the healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a Bin@@ sen@@ ti@@ ty of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era , that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US @-@ elec@@ torate , also split families in the small format . &quot;
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ anch@@ oring there was newspapers with advice on how to cope with the horror of Tr@@ ump of Tr@@ ump .
we are all supposedly directed to all of us to put our filter bub@@ bles .
less noticed is the power of wor@@ m@@ umps and families .
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been visiting with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , who visited me this week in New York . &quot;
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone who knows it , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ dre@@ d , with which she fought for decades due to politics , suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side . &quot;
&quot; in order to the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in a further connection that this will also bring significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the suspen@@ sive effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gross@@ est possibility that we will no longer encounter his mist@@ ress of a day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario , in which Tr@@ ump Re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison with his standards suddenly as a term of neg@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; nowadays I find myself from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how its tax statement looked ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact occur a very mild crimes . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of Re@@ public@@ ans must only be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as im@@ measurable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ uss@@ ells of the New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars that one can spend in the city when you don &apos;t need a caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all the clo@@ wns are cris@@ y and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and climate changing music conve@@ ys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many Kl@@ is@@ che@@ es of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite across the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss Cottage - the topic @-@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; but Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange experience , as here two two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have assessed the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him full score , but fortunately no one has asked for that . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before using my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in coffee from the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to buy the rating with a 15 % gratu@@ ity - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this leads not only to a slo@@ wing of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ting pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was apologi@@ zing , while I got tired the experience to reach my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar p@@ ic@@ us with chest pain sent from prison to hospital
p@@ istol has left the prison for a hospital at the second time .
&quot; last year he was brought to hospital due to the treatment of cuts in his wr@@ ists , which he suffered the prison authorities after a fall in his cell . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us was condemned for a first overthrow of the pro@@ secut@@ ors , against the murder of the pro@@ secut@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; he killed Ste@@ en@@ kam@@ p in the early hours of Valentine &apos;s Day , by following it several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us asser@@ ted that he held his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal inv@@ aders , who hid in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the pro@@ secut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal to this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of p@@ istol appeal , from which they say it be too sighted . &quot;
&quot; the National Criminal Court of Justice said that it will be lifted up to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years , when the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful . &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer find a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the neighborhoods of F@@ sho@@ oters and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen have been dischar@@ ged into the holidays and leading schools . &quot;
three of the kidn@@ apping go to the gram@@ mar school in the future four on the real school .
Schul@@ tz@@ erin Angel@@ ica sit@@ te greeted the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
&quot; the 29 students of the four classes elected by Sophia Schu@@ macher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des for a young eagle , who grows up in chicken , but then released into the freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the m@@ enter@@ e Sch@@ ar introduced a musical with the title &quot; The Adler in the chicken . &quot;
&quot; Arnold Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to bro@@ o@@ ds his chicken . &quot;
instead of a chicken egg came a little eagle out .
&quot; but the hope of making him a chicken , t@@ attered , the eagle rose up on a high mountain his wings , and escaped . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the studies of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance . &quot;
the hen danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les ; the cylin@@ ders bore to the bet .
&quot; the eagle stands for the integration , &quot; said Schul@@ sch@@ erin Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the young is different from the other young animals ( chi@@ cks ) , but also available . &quot;
he will never be like a chicken .
&quot; his purpose is to be free . &quot;
&quot; in each case , you wish to wish a quarter @-@ night @-@ win@@ der that he was supposed to be accepted in his new school . &quot;
&quot; the address was followed by the colleagues , the former school@@ manager Michael Müller , who again jumps at teaching g@@ us@@ sen , and the parents representatives . &quot;
&quot; the chi@@ cks is now over , explained class instruc@@ tors Sophia Schu@@ macher . &quot;
&quot; she was leaving her students for two years of teaching only very much , because it had been a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the neighborhoods . &quot;
&quot; at the end , all students got a song from summer time and holiday season . &quot;
there was great joy with the children .
for the new school year there are already eight first entry .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned because of illegal camps in Greece , shared the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television . &quot;
&quot; in Si@@ th@@ onia , the police was arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
the same day they were released while an investigation is currently running .
the State Department reported b@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated control of the free camps and place each who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose to substantial money on . &quot;
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can hang a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know now
how exactly do the software update take place ?
must diesel @-@ drivers take part in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
&quot; diesel cars have offered BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group updates for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they are intended to improve the emission standards of cars of the emission classes 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from it .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in of ACE Auto Club Europa are estim@@ ations :
is the new action obligatory ?
&quot; no , the tra@@ ded software updates are optional . &quot;
&quot; the compulsory updates previously only apply to vehicles , the Schum@@ ann software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
its retro@@ fit has arranged the power plant state ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the makers have announced a growing implementation in the next few months , but not called an exact date . &quot;
Daimler has communicated to any person concerned .
&quot; if any inspection may be paid , this will be done within the frame . &quot;
how long should the equipment be drawn altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the hill@@ sides of the involvement of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , volunte@@ ering , the aut@@ oh@@ er @-@ creators with the issue of environment so far not . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the upgrade itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE to wait .
&quot; probably foreign manufacturers would go up , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
is now a massive price fall from Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE feared that .
&quot; but even in the regions , where driving b@@ anning is dro@@ wned . &quot;
there are so far no loss of value for older diesel until now .
the ACE is to be seen with a sale still .
ll C@@ ool J receives Kennedy Center @-@ Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the glam@@ orous events in Washington .
&quot; the first prize will be promised under President Tr@@ ump , politically . &quot;
one of the winners will not come - out of protest .
ll C@@ ool J ( 49 ) is regarded as the first r@@ apper one of the cov@@ eted prizes of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the culmin@@ ation device announced on Thursday , this year the &quot; &quot; Est@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) , and the chore@@ ograp@@ her del Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the chore@@ ograp@@ her producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) . &quot;
the awards will be handed over in early December .
&quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and participate together with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;
the winners of a progressive TV series announced that it is already announced on the participation in the gala .
&quot; the New York Times &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this Presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even the means to depri@@ ve them - and even bur@@ dened me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to clarify their view . &quot;
the Kennedy @-@ Center after the former President John F. Kennedy nominated Kennedy @-@ Center is the largest culmin@@ ation in the U.S. capital .
&quot; among the earlier awards include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city li@@ vable
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes in R@@ ent in the coming year . &quot;
&quot; however , the place is already written - suitable applicants are rare . &quot;
since 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been .
and the work still makes him great fun as he is in the press interview .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for its successor . &quot;
at the same time sh@@ eri@@ ed him that so far no application does not cover the requirement profile .
the city is looking for an architect or engineer at the end of time .
so - taking into account the regular notice period - still enough time for a review .
&quot; since Has@@ l@@ ach acts for the administrative community as a sub@@ ordin@@ ance authority , the applicant needs to present relevant degrees . &quot;
for this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it is no longer able to fill in them any more , the citizens should continue to consult with Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but civil closeness is the city and it itself important , says W@@ acker that reported by a good company lim@@ a as well as a good mood between the authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; over 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated over to the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city li@@ vable , &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building office and its employees . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ arrangement of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as , and of the low @-@ car park , are about . &quot;
&quot; the bridge between B@@ oll@@ en@@ bach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter is estimated to beat around 1.5 million euros alone , &quot; &quot; when we make it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my followers . &quot;
work here is fun . &quot;
sty@@ led is available for a municipal Master of great man@@ oeu@@ vre .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building and gar@@ dener could be much flexible to react .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants will often be praised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; since the old city as an ensemble stands under monument protection , it is important to have an eye to have what fits &quot; &quot; when new buildings are approved , empha@@ sizes the lower Stadt@@ bau@@ meister . &quot;
anyway the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has high responsibility .
&quot; he is the landlord , &quot; in the end everything goes down to my table . &quot;
&quot; on many years of support and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ maier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been around for ten years now , Manfred Schön@@ er ( frozen ) has been around for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really identified and want to stay . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good company lim@@ a , but also for the wider design of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use Roland W@@ acker , should ask for information about the city of Has@@ l@@ ach , a completed study as a diploma @-@ engineer or Bachelor with technical direction architecture , and have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction companies . &quot;
&quot; the municipal office under@@ stand high and low @-@ pressure , construction planning , gra@@ under@@ age , administration of urban loung@@ ers , municipal farm with construction and cit@@ atory house , including the under@@ building authority , including monument protection . &quot;
bike on cables dropped : south @-@ track locked
according to police the previously unknown do@@ ers had passed the blue bicycle from the railway pi@@ pelines in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener street ( B@@ 116 ) on the leader@@ ships .
these were so heavily damaged that the her@@ eu@@ pon freight for@@ war@@ es had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male t@@ aps and look for them for night hours .
near the scene we have been observed by witnesses a pink and a bike driver .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ b stre@@ ich , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to the APA . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator would have brought himself in great danger , and at risk of the train traffic . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the installation , as well as the long @-@ minute drive and the cost of compensation traffic , even the track of rail customers could also come to the perpetrators . &quot;
&quot; altogether , be of a &quot; considerable &quot; sum , &quot; the speaker said . &quot;
&quot; the damage was fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south@@ ward track could be run without disability . &quot;
&quot; almost ten person@@ ages were on Friday morning , two of them consider the remote traffic . &quot;
&quot; goods fell away , however , they had a delay . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged around 200 meters high lines .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to rel@@ ieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bo@@ wel disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare .
&quot; but a new study claims the exact opposite : a diet , which is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million and 300@@ ,000 in the US , causes stomach ul@@ ls and blo@@ ating , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while those affected are usually advised to allevi@@ ate meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Washingtoner Artenschutzüberein@@ kommen that helps develop an essential amino acid Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins to develop a tolerant intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol , to ensure that damaging micro@@ bes that hide in food not to penetrate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to em@@ ulate inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body , without damaging tissue . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; in experiments , it has been noted that a type of tolerance promoting immun@@ cell cell on mice , which carry a particular bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the components of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial and lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a lack of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet tolerant , less inflammatory bo@@ b@@ umps , if the same system is wir@@ es with people . &quot;
&quot; the Post@@ doc@@ torate @-@ in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immun@@ cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study @-@ shre@@ ws had such cells , but a different group of the same tribe that had not been separated . &quot;
&quot; they suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ologists of the mice , the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi , which usually live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the ones of the mice were found DNA sequ@@ en@@ es and there were found six bacterial species that were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them in mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were raised in a steri@@ li@@ ous environment so that they l@@ acked a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria turned on the immune system , the researchers joined L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a fluid and then led small amounts of liquid - without un@@ ripe immune cells which were isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed to the tolerant cells .
&quot; when the active component has been cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism , which is known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ l@@ actic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers double the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ dicap were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i can develop the cells in humans as with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i lead to an extension of this population .
&quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot; &quot;
&quot; at Manchester United , signed with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , &quot; &quot; Gen@@ ie &quot; , &quot; believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ field player on the Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A @-@ Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impres@@ sing in the Hal@@ ter &apos;s role as people like Paul Po@@ g@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira . &quot;
&quot; MA@@ TIC was however ruled out by the prepar@@ atory Asia @-@ Tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had to improve it before the beginning of the Premier League . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later ready .
&quot; beside M@@ atic , also Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in the avi@@ va stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wished for three further peti@@ tions , but he ins@@ isted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of his four prime concern . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , for this I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happier if they were four out of four , but they have made great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. manufacturer &apos;s Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. State of Michigan , and moved into the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the shape of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be the shape of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers .
the whole thing was a term for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
&quot; new deep envelope for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
&quot; but as the wind revol@@ ves : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , the S &amp; D prime minister always looked forward with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; merely no stor@@ fire from the party central , merely a head@@ wind from the covenant - it was the most important wish of the campaign fighters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the staff members from the Willy Brandt @-@ House are watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach .
there were low set@@ backs .
and one after the other .
&quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal government sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions from the SPD and the Greens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be sure , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; the surprising fac@@ tional statement of a Green Party , the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) has thrown into a difficult crisis . &quot;
five months before the Sunday election his red @-@ green coalition lost its A @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Greens @-@ Federal Minister Michael Kellner gave the ab@@ err@@ atic Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Green @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ ests to return to their mandate .
the trans@@ duc@@ er to CD@@ U means a clear de@@ del@@ e@@ tion of the elec@@ torate .
El@@ ke T@@ ests immediately needs to return to their mandate and said the Federal Minister of managing and Elec@@ tions of the Greens to the editors of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; this must not be true , but , an SPD constitu@@ tive fighters , than on Friday morning the new Hi@@ king message reached the party centre . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ President of Lower Saxony , stands after crossing the green MEP El@@ ke T@@ ests to the CD@@ U without its own government majority . &quot;
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of big and small crises in the SPD country associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the misery began with the unexpected clear defeat in the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med down the comrades . &quot;
&quot; after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and Nor@@ dr@@ h@@ ein @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
that was then - and everything was clearly worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the Tau@@ ride , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite Haute the party . &quot;
&quot; for the weeks , comrades in the weeks afterwards came up again . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had just taken new courage , the G @-@ 20 @-@ Summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next deep .
&quot; Mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD leader , lost his Nim@@ bus , because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned . &quot;
and because he did in crisis communication so pretty much everything is wrong .
since then Schol@@ z fighting for its political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; due to the VW exhau@@ st and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime @-@ Sax@@ on Prime Minister has already been in criticism . &quot;
mi@@ ese re@@ frac@@ tional values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps because of that , Wei@@ l tried to become increasingly stronger in the federal government in the past weeks . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the former mayor of Hanover , his power in Berlin remained un@@ conce@@ aled , comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz remained un@@ conce@@ aled . &quot;
they let him grant it because they spoke of Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party .
&quot; now , the exact opposite could enter . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l meets the party in internal constraints , is basically no fault . &quot;
and Schulz not at all .
&quot; sometimes , comrades try to hold its own ranks . &quot;
&quot; your wrath is directed toward the Greens , and here above all on the ab@@ err@@ atic parliament@@ arians T@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ arable and democratic , as Ms. T@@ ests provides her own career entry over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , Chief of the Party left in the SPD Bundestag , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ ests is not elected because of her person as a direct candidate , but on the national list of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Greens to the parliament so that the Dutch @-@ Sax@@ on group continued . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that they withdraw their mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD Bundestag , compl@@ ained a &quot; non @-@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ torate of four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l for the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who runs the Lower Sax@@ on SPD as a peak candidate in the Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now , the personal careers section of a future CD@@ U @-@ members denoun@@ ced the election result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he asked to clarify the backgrounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want to know if there has been more or more committed to the CD@@ U Lower Saxony . &quot;
funding for local communities III
&quot; who will be his own home in the years , can soon get support from the country . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives in the jet@@ ties on Wednesday in delicate . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler gave once again a review on what happened so far . &quot;
since 1991 it has been in sensitive san@@ itation areas .
&quot; back then , in the refurb@@ ishment I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg has still taken over two thirds of the funding . &quot;
&quot; in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still at 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler the previous re@@ els are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the internal development , not only to open new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , you have received the information from the President of Karlsruhe , that there will be a san@@ itation area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which there were 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the congregation . &quot;
how is a san@@ itation is created ?
&quot; you will continue to examine such s@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; real old &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; however , it also plays a role as to whether in the planned field are at all interested in advance . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the area borders can then also move again . &quot;
&quot; the jet@@ ty appeared on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the content of the federal state @-@ program &quot; &quot; Social Town &quot; , &quot; where the sanctions would then be performed . &quot;
&quot; core of the program are the rev@@ itali@@ zation of inner cities , improving residential and labour conditions and maintenance and expansion of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; measures would object @-@ related , that is per plot . &quot;
&quot; the refurb@@ ishment , then , would finally be defined as a stat@@ ute . &quot;
the approval period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2017 .
&quot; however , until September this year the inventory of this year would only be performed , as part of which those involved in the san@@ itation area will have a questionnaire to fill out a questionnaire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December the pro@@ posi@@ tional decision should be made possible , so that in the coming year it can be started with the sanctions . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann declared that every Commune had to carry the said precautions .
&quot; it is therefore going to evaluate and decide the city &apos;s cities , and decide when it is sanc@@ tioned and to what extent . &quot;
it will then also be registered for the respective property a san@@ itation .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come again and make a picture of the situation he promised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Got@@ zel stressed that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , questionn@@ aires will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; Building &quot; &quot; and the property of the &quot; &quot; Building &quot; , &quot; with which it is possible to view the construc@@ tional state and the san@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; data can be made to size , division and residents of a living room . &quot;
the blue &quot; Oper@@ ator &quot; is to be filled only if in the building business areas are operated .
&quot; however , to be noted , Got@@ zel pointed out that a filled questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; moreover , new construction measures are not beneficial . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler stressed that the distribution of funding for the &quot; &quot; Wind@@ dog principle &quot; &quot; - who comes first is ad@@ mon@@ gers first . &quot;
one could not reserve the funding for later . &quot;
&quot; in conclusion , even photographs of the project &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; were shown to make the present a re@@ conditioning &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
British inventor introduces himself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand@@ movement in house and car
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his door@@ step , enter his office and even start his car . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and for@@ ef@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify your life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a Consult@@ ant An@@ a@@ es@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist in Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , together to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standard . &quot;
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr North@@ am also wants to change the Cast@@ les on houses and cars , so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now installed both at home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the promotional cost of the White House would cost tax@@ payers thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , a naval helicopter for an event to fly for an event that highlights the US manufacturing last month , costs tax@@ payers have been left to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter @-@ helicopter was exhibited in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin and one for@@ k@@ lift from Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or F@@ RA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted to be aware that you are aware of it , because it is an unusual event with high visibility , wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the deputy Marin@@ ek@@ om@@ mer of aviation . &quot;
the message showed that the helicop@@ ters arrived on July 17 at 7 am in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock and so long stayed until the lawn stood between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
&quot; the note adds that if your flight was delayed from the White House , due to the limitation of the service lessons a second team would require a second team for returning flight . &quot;
the original flight atten@@ tions was during the event at the helicopter while the security personnel of unity remained during the time on the plane .
the records made available from the TI@@ ME were not clear if ultimately a second flight service was required .
&quot; the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal , stat@@ eless property for political purposes . &quot;
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the event .
&quot; a question which we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; &quot; the deputy commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the President gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform , which was in the Senate , and he arranged the efforts to con@@ tainment the government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the plane , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
president are obligated to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
&quot; Tr@@ ump led an investigation in February , when the presidential plane was carried out in front of the background of his first Kamp@@ u@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential plane by its predec@@ essors . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products made of all 50 states , which are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lin@@ d@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 Occup@@ ations often lead training flights in the area around Washington and in South La@@ wn by placing the US President in the White House with precise cen@@ tim@@ etres .
&quot; as a Tr@@ ump in early July at the G20 , H@@ MX @-@ 1 was conducted in the White House 58 exercises . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event mat@@ tered with the training requires the flight planning for the month , said a be@@ amer . &quot;
helicopter @-@ units also flew 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ Presidential commis@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the White House said that the tax@@ payers were no burden for none of the other pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event . &quot;
&quot; said Mr Si@@ kor@@ sky , the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn . &quot;
&quot; MX @-@ 1 does not maintain bud@@ get@@ ary desig@@ nations for the presidential trips , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ al of the U.S. Ministry of Defence for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D @-@ Er@@ rat@@ chet for the v@@ H @-@ 3D however is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot;
records of the unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of the operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; the costs for tax@@ payers are set on the basis of estimates for the records , is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; Wal@@ ters said . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs , which are included in the annual funding . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from the year 2015 the income rates for DO@@ D does not contain personnel expenses , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contractual transaction . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ an , the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirel@@ ess@@ ly .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acting with the helicopter , when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the pits of a fire@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky , and burned with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of a kne@@ eling task
premi@@ ère of the Second tennis Bundesliga occurs in the tab@@ ular third Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will run tomorrow at 11 am in Kiel with the tab@@ ular third Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
despite having five games still mac@@ ell@@ os@@ er &apos;s balance sheet has obtained the meaning of the second tennis players in the sense of reality .
team &apos;s chief Mari@@ us Z@@ ay certainly respect the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , always played in quite similar formation . &quot;
&quot; right at the rear positions , I find the crew very well . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V , above all , imports from the high north . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their insul@@ ts and Finn@@ s can even refer to stakes in the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; and they are also strong in the double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ör@@ en and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen , as well as Andreas Bj@@ ör@@ hus ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is as always difficult for us . &quot;
you also need a good serving happiness . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ her team for the trip to the high north stands practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give max@@ im jan@@ in .
&quot; at the moment , the tournament is currently playing at the Chall@@ enger @-@ tournament in Italian Bi@@ ella active French@@ man , is currently playing at the Czech Li@@ bere@@ c Ko@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) for his first use in this season . &quot;
the named Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the White Russians An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski still at the AT@@ P @-@ tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el at the ball .

how America can harm the O@@ MV
&quot; really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump does not work when he put his signature under the law to prescri@@ bes the sanctions against Russia . &quot;
&quot; in his hal@@ ast , the law en@@ act , &quot; the Congress packed a few &quot; constitutional regulations . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was so sharp as expected , and even Brussels dre@@ amy against the US coup . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft is to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors of the domestic O@@ MV are involved in co @-@ financed with other European firms to build the Russian Eastern sou@@ eit@@ ung Nord Stream 2 . &quot;
the dro@@ u@@ isse is tremendous .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump itself would have to aw@@ aken the sanctions even by executive order to life . &quot;
twelve weapons are standing on his election .
&quot; the press &quot; has seen , which the Group might rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot;

the seasons were three and four were confirmed by the streaming Service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest bucks in the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , the DE@@ A has directed its attention to the richest organisation of drug trafficking in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful pins , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 @-@ company &quot; only with more state records and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Damian Alc@@ azar ) is her head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commanded the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;

role backward : the town is 46 cup@@ boards
the city is organized by the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban children &apos;s days the clock is turned back .
&quot; for September 1 , the city Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply to urban children &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance , deputy leader in the field of youth aid , this is good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
cooked will continue except house : a Cat@@ erer takes care of this task and delivers fresh @-@ cooked cool@@ ed .
&quot; the town operates in the Krem@@ lin area 46 children &apos;s locations , in 44 the children get a hot meal for lunch time . &quot;
&quot; last Kit@@ a@@ Year , 2@@ 800 children sat at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children , the 45 week@@ days are taken care of , in the K@@ ita at mid@@ day , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
the offer is also valid in 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 14 o &apos;clock .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time staff have served their meals for salad , crude food and fruit , they supplement the meal individually , food , raw food and fruit , put the meal individually , give the food off , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the workers are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ groups as well as seventy @-@ troops - decide on the timetable .
&quot; the chef now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; so they are much more involved , and it is easier for the relationship to implement educational concepts . &quot;
because that &apos;s why it is about : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
the children should help to prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen staff is there sensible .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far also the duty of the kitchen - will be completed in future by special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has the charm of cleaning and kitchen service - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also the charm that it has made available for the city as the most economical , it is from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are to be re @-@ adjusted . &quot;
&quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the educ@@ ator , not so strongly in weight , &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;

GM@@ B concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a union would like to meet at the managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it @-@ manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in their factory in Glasgow .
GM@@ B Scotland said that the company has wel@@ ded over the future of investments at T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the factory in addition to other products of Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea cookies .
&quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owners Pla@@ dis said , he invested more than 5 million pounds over the last few years . &quot;
&quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives were &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s alle@@ iter company called the GM@@ B Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to express concerns , that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be promoted . &quot;
&quot; GM@@ B @-@ senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can gain no clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of rab@@ ies , our members concerns deeply . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workforce concentrate heavily on the local community and the large space of Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and in front of the background of the Bre@@ xit , the rising life of life and of the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the Fili@@ berto at T@@ oll@@ cross did not only receive a letter from GM@@ B Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it , since we estimate the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had regular meetings with employees and GM@@ B representatives in T@@ oll@@ us@@ i , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we operate as all companies engaged in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , our business is constantly being checked - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognise the heritage of rab@@ ies as a production site . should change our business processes at the location , the employees and their trade union representatives shall be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago from Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the page of La League likes her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not leave in its persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar , after giving up an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to redeem his free@@ ware clause , but have warned Barcelona three years before the world revolution ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ Klu@@ b is ready to break the world record around more than the double of the previous mark , with Paul Po@@ g@@ ba returned last season for 89 million pounds on Manchester United . &quot;
&quot; after the end , Ne@@ ym@@ ar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional sports@@ men of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500,000 GB@@ P a week . &quot;
&quot; it is angry about the way Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced its way home , although a source near the Catal@@ ans predic@@ ament that the club has always been doing its best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President before this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each association , who wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players &apos; , said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players in their sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this summer , Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line with the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G @-@ Mittel@@ feld@@ player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow the International from Italy , under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar . &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen Review @-@ last@@ et Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen Report on the abuse of abuse en@@ cro@@ wned Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report for the mis@@ worn scandal with the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen provides further discussion .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ acher , spokes@@ man of the reform@@ ist movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after publication against the German press agency , he acquired by the former Rain@@ sburg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of the Benedi@@ ct XVI of XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church as Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger her deep regret about his om@@ is@@ sions or their then false evaluation of processes would be expressed .
&quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; , &quot; however , critici@@ zed that in reporting about violence at the cathedral sp@@ at@@ zen is measured with &quot; &quot; two measures &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in regard to the attacks in Regensburg no one doubt that it must be prevented by &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful acts , &quot; but the &quot; degree medi@@ ator &quot; , &quot; thus the author Lu@@ c@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian , and member of the national Italian bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of design@@ ate the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils , is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; also Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis , in the interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; one would like to go on the church and this is a great fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; they also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; beats a very normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; they are unfair to use today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with reports on the abuse of abuse , also pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger first emerged . &quot;
&quot; to injustice , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who was translated with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder band &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take George R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; he value the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is included in the 440 @-@ page report that is presented by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the provision of attorney Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plur@@ ality &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , there was too Georg R@@ atz@@ inger who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it &apos;s possible that Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. was applied in many cases forms of physical and psych@@ ical violence . &quot;
&quot; particularly with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be disastrous . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to numerous other def@@ endants , many victims were estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even connect positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse of the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ pages report on the &quot; &quot; incidents of violence &quot; &quot; of violence perpetr@@ ated by the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen &quot; &quot; gives an contradic@@ tory image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; to the one hand , many students highlight his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and Perf@@ ec@@ tionary that the econom@@ ist was w@@ rest@@ ful when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz has no top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate his bi@@ ograp@@ her this final report ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you make the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the rear , one has to wonder why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was found at all in it . &quot;
he is dedicated to eight pages exactly once and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspi@@ cion of complic@@ ity or co @-@ knowledge in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
also the atro@@ cities in the pre @-@ school are also taking part in the sphere of sphere of sphere .
&quot; at best , it is possible to get out of it too late or not taken seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ing school , on which he worked , was perceived by practically all respon@@ dents said - &quot; &quot; redemption &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so the broad majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger provides an excellent record , describes it as &quot; warm @-@ nat@@ ured &quot; , &quot; &quot; honest &quot; , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; the guys regularly cat@@ ered with cakes , bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; &quot; always supplied by grapes of children . &quot;
&quot; merely a minority compl@@ ained about its perfec@@ tionist and its high level of emotion@@ ality , which also led to deser@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; he that he kno@@ cked not only with chairs and cast the key legs on the ground , but also ear@@ ns and too fre@@ che guys passed on the hair or ears , he himself gave birth to himself years ago , deeply regret and apologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; however , for his honorary salvation , however , that such education methods in the questionable time , the 1960s and seven@@ ties , were widespread , in both parents and teachers . &quot;
do you also know such discipline methods ?
&quot; of course , I think of each one of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I have also experienced this in a se@@ cular school , a state @-@ Gymnasium . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely , the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and violence at the school , are the certainly dre@@ d@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; you ask yourself , whether it is not more familiar with his acquain@@ tance and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have straight forward to him . &quot;
&quot; at Bav@@ arian Pope many , who have never understood him , still di@@ lig@@ ently . &quot;
the truth is : the report dischar@@ ged Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; in the media in connection with the report , it reports a lot about the issue of abuse at the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also put some embarrass@@ ment or co @-@ knowledge related to sexual abuse on the load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very much no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to be familiar to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; said a du@@ ff substitute for the others , &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot;
the true problem with the clarification of sexual abuse was and yet is that most of the victims are silent .
&quot; if she does not even trust parents and si@@ blings , then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a be@@ ati@@ ated student wor@@ ded it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which rup@@ net ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) could have had timely findings and would have been able to spend the respective perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd to accept that out of it ... Bu@@ ben lon@@ ged and clearer or more likely to have opened than to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ men , trust instruc@@ tors , etc . &quot;
that you speak to him about sex ... - un@@ thin@@ kable . &quot;
&quot; thus , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; that concerned with the concerned students and / or their environment , the report could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
what sexual abuse is concerned is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger therefore acqu@@ itted of every co @-@ knowledge .
&quot; so it cannot be accused , nor prevented him or have brought it to the ad . &quot;
&quot; that is why there is no reason to associate a good name with these contradic@@ tory crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media was much of &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; to read in the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was accused in the report .
must he live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in reporting everything is mixed and rejuven@@ ated to a huge milking of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; however , this is again a misuse of the report . &quot;
&quot; namely , there will be clean separated : between the pre @-@ school and the g@@ ymnasium of the domain , between sexual abuse and violence , we say once , other allegations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not chor@@ us of the cathedral @-@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot;
&quot; the whole aw@@ ful audi@@ tor pedago@@ gy , the cases , in which Kn@@ aben were random@@ ized and mal@@ ign@@ ites , and among them were dra@@ ined , un@@ settled at the Vor@@ schule in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen und P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to be fought . &quot;
&quot; but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ing school . &quot;
&quot; on this one , like most witnesses emphas@@ ise the subject of &quot; &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; it was only happy to be escaped , and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states . &quot;
what was different from the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ing school ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was already discipline , but there is no expan@@ sive violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; &quot; a lot of victims estimates the general humanity of R. , and therefore , in numerous cases , despite violence even connect positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; so at most , there is still the accus@@ ation to have looked at . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the Vor@@ schule . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) was nothing to hear , and then again to 1993 . &quot;
betra@@ ying Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ agements , which the report even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this he points to this point , &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the test continues to be practi@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the light of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent inclusion . &quot;
&quot; this was of course at a time when legal clarity was , as the inspec@@ tor had long been banned in Bavaria too . &quot;
&quot; before that , they occurred in a legal gray area , just like any one of us probably know . &quot;
it was difficult for him to estimate where the affected might be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the per@@ missible border had been exceeded .
&quot; but you can not say , he has always looked at . &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the inspec@@ tors in Bavaria was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria too . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Taxis maintained yes , it is unfair to apply the present educational standards to the then time . &quot;
how do you see this ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we have to talk about the &quot; &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; &quot; the danger of the past , according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the princess has already been right .
&quot; of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse which was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times and also not for what was broken in the pres@@ ch@@ ement of rebellion and violence against inno@@ cent chil@@ dr@@ ons which goes far beyond that time . &quot;
this is all quite aw@@ ful and I am glad that it will finally be re@@ worked .
&quot; but at the same time , I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , for all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his funds for discipl@@ ining and punishment , therefore ear @-@ st@@ ling and at the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then forbidden , it has also kept strictly held . &quot;
&quot; what picture of his rainbow &apos;s time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because in discussions with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
did the topic test also for the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ k@@ ts XV@@ I. , tells of his perspective , since the cathedral @-@ sp@@ at@@ zen played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I am not at all that there was a strict rule of reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; but that must be said once again : without this perfec@@ tionist discipline , it would hardly have been possible to form an institution of world tran@@ g , true cultural message of Europe and his musical tradition , which went straight twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one does not make a huge singer and stand before every success , right in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ win@@ der . &quot;
what kind of man have you experienced by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger for talks on their book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through work on the book and in addition , I have seen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well known and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic , deep @-@ hearted and sav@@ ory people , from which one could not imagine that he could not see just a fly somewhat . &quot;
&quot; I am regularly playing with how many former dom@@ es@@ try still keep in touch with him today , 23 years after his Em@@ eri@@ ding , to visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was strictly with them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , father@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but yet a lovely respect , to which they still look up today and which they even adore it . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly , everything you re@@ jects , are educ@@ ator methods which were then on the order at that time . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long been overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just one man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; is the evil intent , which is behind it , just too apparent . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just released , reli@@ eved him . &quot;
&quot; now the Andes @-@ area , a 93 @-@ year old man who has acquired great merits , and without the outside Bay@@ erns and perhaps no one would probably know the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen , at last , would finally be in peace . &quot;
