<seg id="3">"a pit chapel, where now for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the one-sty reasons of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying when the maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">"that knows everyone who had already dreamed about, because the car-Navi instead of a green meadow instead of a green meadow."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical map of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of Geoportas Bayern of the State Government, are all but up to date - but that is why it is very conclusive."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compares them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it will become clear, as cities and municipalities in the spread-area of Munich's Mercury have changed since the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the digital Bavaria atlas is a patchwork of patchwork, which you see as such."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the big supervisor were involved for cities and communities for detailed maps, so-called judgments."</seg>
<seg id="13">This arose according to the details of the Bavarian surveying management between 1810 and 1864 and skip the first Vermessung.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second War of War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave an topographic recording of Bayerns - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops went on with the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801, the European neighbors, who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria-card."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max. Joseph drove the project ahead, and founded the" topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bayerische Observatory management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The judgment sheet for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is as all other to find on the website of the Bavarian National Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison morning / Today is the example of the state capital at the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is Untersendling which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling became 21 years after the creation of the map, thus 1877, as the Munich city district."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, the sendling lies in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings focus at 1856 along the today's Plinganserstraße which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: at Hineinzooming a small card with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-in numbered numbers from the so-called" Urge "," which was derived from the basic tax. "</seg>
<seg id="27">"today, small parcels do not occupy more - but small gardeners of the plant" Land in Sun. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is characterised by the north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 swings of the October Revolution, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the judgment sheet one reads in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, not only the road-name" "at Gasteig" "or from the hill" On the ventilation "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstrasse, once a person comes with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there was 1858 / 59 the Münchner district of the Irrenaissance" "On the Auer Lüften". ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard headed by Gudden - that psychiatrist was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time, and for example, he ended the chains of Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"he is also forbidden to use the personnel to apply violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museums of Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients had been at first place, later it was extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-East is one of Germany's largest psychiatry psychiatrists."</seg>
<seg id="40">At the eighth of the former Auer Anstalt the young people in Munich's Salesianum meet.</seg>
<seg id="41">"the Order acquired the building complex in 1920, and walked in a youth-home with training establishments."</seg>
<seg id="42">"west is the football field of the TSV Munich east, east residential buildings dating from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children-house" "Casa Don Bosco" "was built in an architectural drawing on the country of origin of the Irrency, which had been destroyed during the Second World War."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was recorded at 1856 as" "main square", "the merchant's road was called" Kaufinger alley. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the second world war even in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies were in December 1944 a lot of holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A large stayed until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business buildings and a greeting chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days were the preliminary work and will take place on 5 April 2017 for the second S-Bahn platform."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the sliders, the old Munich-card can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group posted travel insurance for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of colored colored has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board for the Federal State of Missouri, who wish to enter into force until 28 August 2017, since a series of fragmented, non-based incidents in the whole state will occur and here, it is said in the opinion of the group."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law from Missouri, which makes it harder to gain discrimination, as well as the enforcement authorities of the state, disproportionate disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to make the travel warning, the NAACP said."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have injury of civil rights, which people happen."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed," "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency which we have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group assaulted incidents like racial clashes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no gasoline any more, and was taken by the police of Missouri in custody without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also pointed out a recent report by the Office of the General-General-State Office of Missouri, where black motorists in the state will be 75 percent more common than White."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of and inform their families, friends and collaborators who could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be willing to bring if it could be Caution or their relatives have to travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri signed 100 hate speech in 2015 following the latest figures from the hate-back programme of FBI - which include the state in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new missouri law that would make it harder to complain a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil liberties had published (ACLU) travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States of immigration laws had adopted, the local law enforcement authorities have committed to verish people because of immigration violations, which will help the ACLU to further provisioning."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are generally issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries, but in recent times, stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Ordination project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fiscal Weifence-Project is a success project and continues to continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentary MPs Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have gotten a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the Arwendemann family, representatives of the Fiswendemann family met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two representatives."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann granted some insights into his farm, in which it houses 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milkisses and also many young animals and houses in five apartments Feriengaeste."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Black-milk" "is for him of an alternative marketer path for the milk of its cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste comes exclusively regionally.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also known as BLHV-Chairman of Fisherbach, it is important for the" "elementary project". ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not manage on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green area for a lot of work, much has to be processed with the engine sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here with the conditions and with the topography," "stressed Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the elterous operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if it is not bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the ordination project and is happy about the Leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers must be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">"one hope that the forestation of the areas could be drawn up yet another while." ""</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continued their operation," "said the Mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism because of promoting often in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots from eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">"the disclosure area is therefore 40 hectares, which can not be afforested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"of the total cost of 71 500 Euro, half of the population was funded, a quarter carried out the municipality of fisherman."</seg>
<seg id="87">"as a result, the farmers left 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of course fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and women's women."</seg>
<seg id="90">"even for Peter Weiss stood firm," "Here are the best food produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The maternity-law (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state promotion of pasture-fence.</seg>
<seg id="92">Objective is the disclosure of the Schwarzwalds.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisites is the presence of one of the LPR named conveyisse.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the temporary surface must not be less heavy (Hanging over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the forestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the fishery Weibel project 2018, the motion of eight participants are currently running with 24 kilometers of fence, which would like to build up just 16 kilometres fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the open space corresponds to 35 hectares, the Calabrian costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime changes is when they begin to attaching the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ash in a hitty dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the proposals of Presidents to drastic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller does not hold the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of landowners and Liberty Imitators would have wrestling him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he laid hold of its importance, and in particular the meaning that you have been written when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta shaded:" I don't want to go down here for a full thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illumines the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you refer to is later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is correct properly, but as it behaves itself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about contemporary resonance on the ascending words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state invites not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" "your exhausted masses, who desire for it, free to breathe free, the miserable waste of your wealthy coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "miserable waste" was better viewed on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller has not been committed in literary criticism - he clearly did that these people in Trumps USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: it is indeed a conflict about the significance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who settled for it to place their words after her death on the basis - were very good that they have taken a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by placing the feminine embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself another name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminine coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and exactly how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people wanted to change from the right wing this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great cry as Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not one, but rather an early neo-conservative is that the American flame is moving into the converted world:" Lady Liberty is proceeding. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It shall bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something hit.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and certainly a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative action of Lazarus consisted in them to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, but hopeless people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the true sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"of course, this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever recognise."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not enlighten the way but the hatred, who is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championships 2017: Neil Black looms Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle remembers a time when only two shots belonged to the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">"the power Director of the Leichtathletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member states of the World Championships" will contribute a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "developed in Scotland some special" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find it," said Black. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Leichtathletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type at the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which can compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 ft route, while emiliie Doyle was chosen by the crew to the team-kapsel."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"her captain's speech was amazing," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were chottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the genuine feeling that Eiliie brought quite naturally, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth-Silver medal winner, which will compete in their fifth World Championships during the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" incredible "that 16 gots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven that were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The midstrew Muir leads on this road and has five UK and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m run, is another Scotsman, which one should observe the victory in the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers its first World Championships as the only other Schotte in the team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">"Manning Chapters says that they are" enormously proud "of the fact that many of their compatriots do not only belong to the team, but in some cases even with the medals and at the Finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing to be on the team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honor anyway but to know that my team-mates voted for me and chosen to do something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the villi that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to rise on poisdies."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech is concerned as a chapter?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">"I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home world championship."</seg>
<seg id="158">"so it is really important to put on this home support and profit from it, that we are back at the Olympiastadion."</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go down there and compete, and it simply will be such a great atmosphere out there."</seg>
<seg id="160">"blocking critic on Facebook: don't throw you to a public office, if you cannot tolerate the freezing of voters"</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of poor press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers led him because of everything, from domestic policy to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he shuttled in criticism, safely."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not have his critics to be silenced.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783 Washington said," "The freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid, and mute, we become as the sheep to slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Governor General Larry Hogan, who has to work on it to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Society complained him therefore at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the rod of the governor left the lawsuit as freevol, and the online comment was full of a counterreaction with" Well, "and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like stool.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is an Republican Governor in a overwhelming democratic state, which is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the two-highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary Hitzhead.</seg>
<seg id="176">"" "he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles."</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect to his voters and to debate his hailess head after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blockage of persons who come to the side of the Governor - which is a public forum that is officially designated as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax-Dollars - needless and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, HowSprecherin Amelia Chasse the acts of the governor and argued that the blockage of comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spitting or hectic people, who resonate online the whip."</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people that were blocked by Hoganese.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments are respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest brought the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic Faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer. Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hasserted but she asked for hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate speech and gave other current news, she wrote in the commentary box of the news posting" The Post. "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea when a number of people takes place on the same subject, then they are misrespected by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the members of the governor referred to as" concentrated spam attack, "others would probably be called" "intercede". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era is easy to cut a message by simply blocked a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in previous time, if you had done the same that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical ladders and to burn or burn protesters."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that is exactly what is happening digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials who criticises it with Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is emailed by Twitter-users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County last the First Amendment, according to the U.S. district of James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she appointed a voter of her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be that hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, Washington had a similar effect at the time of the affordable port."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplies between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous correspondence stroke on his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius "," wrote all letters to newspapers, which made Washington decisions. "</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, who criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and navigation with the United Kingdom of criticized his office, according to historical documents collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>

<seg id="1265">"policy makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates down to 0.25%, with less members a rise in this month since the weak economic growth has weakened its support for an increase."</seg>

<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrunk from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack their bags and sells her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," "says Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1321">I searched for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">"this apartment was shown in Earls Court in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1323">I was in love with them and made an offer on this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet of the apartment has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">"originally a one-bedroom estate with a wasted layout - you had to go through the kitchen, to get into the bedroom - wanted to add joanne storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"this was my request," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, they commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the blanket was not large enough to place two rooms, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">I had to think creative thinking to release the stock.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel works is quite complicated," "he explains."</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were overthrown over, without which we had to bate ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but to lay the steel so that it had the right heights above or down."</seg>
<seg id="1334">"this arrangement made it possible to place Erfan, two rooms in full height - with a lot of extra drama."</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine looks a classic copper window from Retrouvius over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silberne accents and Vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program."</seg>

<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering was there," "explains Erfan of the stahlreinforced, furnitated MDF door."</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is very important, so it is when you slide the door very easily."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the base for sale - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they managed to increase the ground floor, and at the same time use top quality materials, which allows the space to gain its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and who therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>

<seg id="1356">"two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a confrontation because of one of the largest real estate imperial Victorias worth over 500 million dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"the former director of the" Carlton-Football Club's and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business should be divided. "</seg>
<seg id="1358">"Paul already wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers met 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family has bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail business."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis is now offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"according to an agreement with her late father, Colin - was described by Paul as" "main operator and the dominant personality" "in the family De Lutis - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A judicial record states that this means Colin property worth $316 million and Paul valued at the value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the divisions proposed by Colin proposed resolutions have left him with what I held for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed recruiting the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the brothers now fight for control of the existing business - what Colin, as Paul claimed to be excluded."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"argued, this was not true, but raises Paul before, some possessions incompetent to manage."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early affair, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hope to raise the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian legacy writes, that the family is the most important priority" "he wrote."</seg>
<seg id="1372">"the cost increases in the event, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both sides held law."</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her died husband Luigi were Italian immigrants to run the milk-bars and delicacy stores from the late 1950-s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">"you used the security to buy the Collingwood collection, opened in the Colin the first jeans of the family."</seg>

<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoping to pass their property to their children."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi said often to me, that he never wanted the brethren to land in court," she wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1378">"two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, with Colin asserted that Mark paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1379">"both Luke and Mark were," says Paul "about the conditions of their financial separation."</seg>
<seg id="1380">"Colin has returned very much, although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from 2015 of Eddie McGuire the best friend of the television stars."</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their attorneys.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"only Colin answered by SMS, to say" I can really not say much, "because the case before the courts may be."</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to mourn and to move our family names through the dishes," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1384">"in mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother."</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father did not know that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute," he said and added that he is still hoping for a solution. "</seg>

<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of the White House, met at his first working day by leading employees, he set a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House which he refused: poor information that got into the hands of the President."</seg>
<seg id="1395">"Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings, because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information."</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to count Trump by monitoring its media dions.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps relationship with television dates back for decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television inheritance is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if candidate was upset because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of places that were to convince," said the former election consultant Sam Nunberg in February to Politico. "</seg>

<seg id="1402">Perhaps these combat officers know something we don't know - that Trumps Tweets would have included more carnition without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never experience something about the tweets which Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his employees had made it a few times, anger can hold off from him, then their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>

<seg id="1407">"Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May with the fondness of the consultants, the president for strategic reasons, without doubt."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example which was described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-officials say that Trump can react to negative press cuts, especially those with shameful leaks and that he will find out where these come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this happened in the end of February when someone was accused of a printed copy of an article by Gottar.com, the website of the Internet provocation by Charles C. Johnson, who was the source behind a heap of being of leaks in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was scanned out of Twitter because of Shikanen, or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accusations in the past and voke them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">"Trump read the article and started to ask employees about Walsh."</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the then rod of Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system to manage and document the Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same for three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence."</seg>

<seg id="1484">"US intelligence agencies accuse the Kremlin for long, to be targeted in the presidential election in 2016."</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there was disagreements between the mumps of campaigns and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigation, several men should stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republican."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to report, Mueller also took more and more trumps private and business environment among the magnifier."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" Washington Post "wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Representative Trump spent personally to the center and seek the accusation if the President in the course of the affair may have obstructed the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1489">"the main task of Grand Lawyers is to examine and decide this evidence in possible failure, and decide whether to be charged."</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand juries are therefore also called charges.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are switched on when it comes to bigger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The trial is always behind closed doors.</seg>

<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President on Thursday night took a speech in West Virginia to portray Russia-affair as campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia-history is a total invention," "said Trump."</seg>

<seg id="1526">According to many researchers this could be connected to the warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has been a part of the Larsen-C Schelfeis.</seg>

<seg id="1533">"I'm talking about the fact that the Larsen-C Schelfeis is in danger, as the preload has never withdrawn as far as it is currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the iceplate is under tension and could be discarded, if at a key point, there is a piece of brevity."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"melting melt by Schelfeis and Eisberg is not elevated to sea level, as they swim in the water and ice as much water as it does after melting itself."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the depot leads to the fact that the glacier directly flows into the sea and can flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase the level of level, but only in the low measure, the British research project for observation of the Antarctica (MIDAS)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is after AWI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres the fourth quarter of the Antarctica.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"the passage from the mainland is up to 700 metres thick, on the front-edge to the free ocean around 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural happening and no direct connection to climate change is conscious, the ice sign is now in a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most successful withdrawal from the beginning of records," "confirmed he also."</seg>
<seg id="1543">"under scientists may be controversial, whether the Larsen-C Schelfeis going to grow again or long, and possibly collapsed," said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even though these researchers will not lead the upheaval of this gigantic iceberg on climate change, so in recent decades, very many ice-drops of the Antarctic peninsula are discarded."</seg>

<seg id="1547">"according to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice area of the Antarctic peninsula has gone back to 28 000 square kilometers."</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly paper Riodoce meet usually on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and unceaseless drug wars. "</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">It has been told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what is more secure: they should take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with Granads, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"safety experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporter to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdomen."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug policies, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of the secret list of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no resting break from violence, and while throughout the country the corpses are frequent, more and more journalists are standing: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 have been subject to attack and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven states this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, its editors and their inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be journalist, Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence in connection with drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence is felt deep, although its presence is present everywhere - a large picture of Valdez, which shows its mediumfinger with the word" Justice "depends on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, wear T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmare, insomnia, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although in 2010 a probe of the Federal Convention was established, in order to process the cases of journalists, it introduced only two criminal proceedings according to the committee for the protection of journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murder, each year associated with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely put forward to justice."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are outrageous and even though the terrain is still slowed down."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of safety is little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to waste my time at this workshop," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know this, we mistrust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"in the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive a few blocks away, before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - the" "Twelded river". ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius went away in his car away and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two adults.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to walk freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But to the theme of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans arrest in the past year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlements of the country as rivaling factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the streets or that the cemetery is full of figured out two-story removal of plastic registers, which are larger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget about a minute that there is a state of" rest, "if only a cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"initially, in February the publication of a interviews with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cartons in the war with Guzmans's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have made annoyed the sons, suspected gangmembers bought each copy of the output as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second fault was in this, Valdez does not impose on this, after the confiscation of a different newspaper which had published the same story to leave the country into its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killings is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues imitate that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was active as an experienced reporter for Noroeste when he joined with five colleagues for the foundation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa, it was impossible to operate journalism, without encountering the anti-dowry problem," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with the time, the paper served a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and revenues and publicity."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporter loved it, hard apt investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories, which nobody else to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it lead."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ-award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trade in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV in October last October."</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you have to take the task that falls to you as a journalist, either that or you play the dumb."</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what did you do in view of so many things... why did you not say what was going on?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce-Team mixed Valdez, the spawn-bird, who was like a dockers, the friend, the generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trust in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite to the office, go and sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now, ask them: was his love for routine his destruction?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also has forced them to question their own assumptions on how they can perform their work best and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like it, if you are dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runaways and cross-ways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that" smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happens with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer in Sinaloa, as not as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, suddenly there were no mobile phones allowed. days before has been known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen were seeking protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the local government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-class area of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen, which the governor himself referred to as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago, since the reporters have gone into the mountain scenery, where the drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has put on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an exposé to the government spending, which focused on the hometown of the governor."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group that in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, led a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write, which everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug retailers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"reporters from public records, that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy leader who ruled the governing Institutional Revolution Party (Pri), who ruled out almost the whole century all political planes."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several Pri governors were accused of high-careless cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this pub, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman came to a military takeover."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"just a few months before, the readers have seen the column of Valdez as the best informed source about the kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had already knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of its slim body stature. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez was dedicated to storage space for signs and stickers, devoted to the morde of journalists, because the employees have become something they had never expected, activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">"reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped up a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning, because of another journalist to the Office of the Public Prosecutor."</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists have become vociferous by having written in organized protests" SOS Press "on walking and constructions."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"this day, the director Bojorquez went away in Washington and tried to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"in a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, on the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to pronounce journalists and bring it to it because they said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has therefore asked that she is once again divided by the government, because it is concerned that her anger has violated their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico by organised crime, involved in government officials and a equal society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security workers who have organised crime among a blanket."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the media-whales group" Articulo 19 "was assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials over the past year."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico, you think, because they want you to disproportionate the mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"your body was found along with a note that supposedly signed by the Zetas de Kartell:" "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer stats and earphones in addition to their separated head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">"some branches have chosen to include, like the newspaper El Norte at the northern border of Chihuahua for the assassination of the correspondents Miroslav Breach in March."</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue on how it did El Manana from Nuevo Laredo following the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels on the title page with the title "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they are still watching the roads and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted how it was apparently murdered by the photographer Ruben Espinosa, which was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who remain back and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be Poets, gives it to that the drug-trafficking promised him."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and therefore I was reporter."</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat at the sidewalk before the office and drank beer, than once all their phones began to reach."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of sliding-notaries with bandages and security guards near the bathing resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continues to escalate as it was promised by a series of Kartell messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the brownstone edge they released the news on the website of Riodoce about mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The title page had to be changed on the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens heels in the vicinity - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">"Bojorquez threw a look at the police officers, the guards held to see if they were in readiness."</seg>
<seg id="1919">If they were afraid they didn't show it.</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, the Mittelfinger was visible for quite Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed its traces."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you only think about it," said Bojorquez, "if on the same day when Javier was murdered, the practicant asked me to send them to the street."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used to soften its enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">At first sight it looks like a statue if also a frightening.</seg>

<seg id="1925">"it was so well preserved that they could even find that its chartered skin of reddish was brown - and they said they could have had something of a" troubled past. ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" "Current Biology" "was referred to as" the arduous dinosaur dinosaur, who ever was found, and one of the best dinosaurs specimens of the world. "</seg>

<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant-eaters is the best preserved fossil fuel of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk when he was born on 21 March 2011 in Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something which was missing from the surrounding rocks at the board, and decided to see more accurately."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy oil cladding."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blinking a little with the eyes, you could almost believe it has slept," said the captain Caleb Brown, scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is visible. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it is going to be more than one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs of dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this plant fresher, although he is covered with an armor and a changing shell, probably by meat frescos dinosaurs was threatened."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage, in order to hide from predators, and used a shielding technology which is known as opposed to many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have allowed themselves to better mix in its surroundings and to soften its enemies, say, what suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaur has been headlines for the first time in May and is now in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta markchelli after the Museumstealth Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the astounding conservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of scales and armaments about his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shaded, a common defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shaded is common, the results are surprisingly, as the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it points to the fact that the dinosaurs was hunted out of sufficient pressure by meat-eating dinosaurs, that the evolution of the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the counter-shadation - think of deer, zebras or garrison - are much smaller and hurting than prey, which signalized that this Nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behavior on a massive, strongly armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators have to have been", "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis organic compounds in their skins also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs red brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal on hints about his life, including its fourth Darminhaltes to find out what it eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs died when he died, into a river and went out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably more widespread than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really noteworthy, because it is completely covered with convent skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the beast," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal is almost exactly the same as in the early chalk time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just have a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is at bedtime."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time when giant theropoden, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs, the earth were drafted."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his furious ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this belongs to the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tonnes heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings in the scientific journal Current Biology appear, believe that Borealopelta was buried after the death in the sea and in mud mumified."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was born on 21 March 2011 in Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the pre-adjusted dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long peaks that rained from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armored plant-eaters was curved by the western Canada, until a flooded flow into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaurs kept his armour in an exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">"the petrified remnants of this particular specimen are so well preserved, that the skin remains still hollowed hollows along the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"like Michael Greshko for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as" rare as a profit in the Lotto. "</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"just one day after having arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis in the bed of an Airbnb apartment which she rented and scrolling through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled across a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year child, and it still is on the street," says it there. "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, as no one else had posted the information on their feed, she finished Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on its timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., killed live, live."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He sted a picture of browns lebloos that was stretched on the road and would stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," thought Ferrell at itself. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new to them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her cell phone away in order to return to Tweet on people on the Canfield Drive later.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people, the crying, and by a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription:" Fergusons police have just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">They watched a live feed on which a policeman was in front of a group of demonstrators with a bellish dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said that another policeman is his rifle and cried out," I will kill you... animals all kill you. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," she remembered her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder that we have used to ourselves and that we can call them typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt joyous frost.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept.</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a flight back and went home next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock, she fetched her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary film," Whose Streets "," in the cinemas from the 11. "</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and the protest, of love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the perspective of men that live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, who bore a flower-dress and a suitable crown, after Ferguson, the two had a conversation that they had countless times in front of this morning" over the black experience and the black state. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what she believed?" she remembered what she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">We are now going to Ferguson because the police have killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not correct.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">That which happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">You have to know it and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it has to be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even though I have the luck to give her an experience, in which they personally experience no eclatant racism, it is no different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would turn her a bad service to keep them away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when she arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which was a place against the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there was Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local staff, lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and halves to pass them to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly started to accept a new kind of activism for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism was completely changed after the 9th of August," she said and notices that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"" "I had no experience in organizing."</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her comrade Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to only document" document "," what happened. "</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came from Ferrell in the sense:" "do you want to document, or try to find a story that you can exploit?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by white - in a community, benefitted by their pain and resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently explained in an interview:" "we heard that people who were born in Ferguson and grew up, their voices do not centred and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for its activism around Todestrakt inmates."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought the project closer to Ferrell's project, along with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets "" in the years following browns. "</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not somebody who speaks for us or speaks with us. we talk," said Davis. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, because I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr's experience - to show that it is with the movement" not a Messiah leader, but about a community that comes together, "said Folayan - she proved to be the most revealed participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"consequently, documents of" Whose Streets show? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells life, as she loves and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be certain vulnerability during this work and in the humanization of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells has repeated history the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have shaped the film" BlacklivesMatter "in social media, identify as a sulphul."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in executive positions have borne the movement altogether," "said Ferrell," and we are constantly struggling with different fronts. "</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must wear the main last of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to notice, that" the movement is really held by black women and many black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it is clear that" this is not a affirmative type of action, "where Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who stirred this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence, although it was at the forefront, because with a life on these crosses as a black, sowl wife is so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the cameras cameras in Ferguson have long gone, but the racial connections between the church and the police are continuing."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of the blockage of a highway in a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area they call their home: "a mess."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, they pledged themselves to a singing and she feels bound to this memory, since she went on the road three years ago in Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love and support each other.</seg>

<seg id="2088">"from" dream "to" scale ": TV readers are discussing about bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit-gallery moves the people, although it is not yet built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern part of the pedestrian zone splits since the first presentation in 2009 the population in advocates and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold the topic hardly leaves one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "People's Frey and Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to say to the bit:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" that would be genuine "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" does not need a person "(Siggi pers) or quite simply:" "size" "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while advocates build on that a gallery attract more customers into the city, from which the rest of the business will benefit, the opponents of that then the pedestrian zone bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farm market hall is available in which 13 market market market offers its products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the start of construction work will be the conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the Gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new construction, namely for Beda square with possibility of sitting outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"Simone Room:" "we have been buying a market hall for many years for many years."</seg>

<seg id="2101">"we would like to have a chance to maintain this offer, even during and especially after the construction of the gallery."</seg>

<seg id="2103">"especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Gerd Densing:" whether direct market in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the amount of the rent. "</seg>

<seg id="2107">"clothes, shoes, drugor supermarket: I find it superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are plenty of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You see how many Ladin stores are empty here - some have been empty for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a decent weekly market, it is all the more important that us at least receive the market hall."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods are fresh there, is mostly offered directly from the producer and is also very inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, Ladin stores are reserved only from larger companies, because the rents are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"shame, specialty shops there is almost no more and what still exists, will probably even disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a markthalle does not fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmers market hall during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even if the bit-gallery is actually actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">"or does it get the specter-gallery before, all shops from Bitburg?"</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it just will not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"a Shopping Center, which is empty, does not need any one."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my view, it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farmers' market there are many - as I find - sensuous construction projects in Bitburg is no longer a place.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"if the peasant market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portrait with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost invisible from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and Haarlem who have been sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from the prison of Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analyst sent a 35-year prison sentence after they made publicly known diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on August 2nd, is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewy-Hagborg, whose discipline was united in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transwife and groundbreaking dissied, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been extracted from the algorithms analysis of DNA, which was extracted from Manning and look out of the 30 portraits, such as someone could interpret with these genomic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the indurent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning who was born as Bradley Edward, but has been spoken openly about the identification as a woman, was condemned in 2013 due to 20 accusations, including six violations against the SpionageAct, computer was and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in jail, her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a bashing, black-white selfishy, in the Manning clearly sits at a driver's seat and has a platblonde Perspacy - with which it was also associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of its 2012-Project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Therein the artist portrait of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette smoke and chewing gum that extracts the DNA from the waste to create a picture of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," stated Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea, and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse were exchanged at unequal brilliance that exchanged several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of the Shoili Kanungo illustrated Comic" Suppressed Images, "which would foresee a future in which President Chelepad's ruling would convert and it would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning release was asked for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome way of happenings."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also a little lowering and Starkes at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads to war against informants from the governmental camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable paths that he should actually fix, continue to defling."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about all these things, she said that" things happen to happen for a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"on the wall of the gallery underwritten artistic statement, Manning with her oversized signature below (the" i "in her family name is provided with a heart) an end of the automatic fragmentation, the basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandwich of Cs, and Gs and As, in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"to show Dewey-Hagborg, by integrating the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist) show how amazing, at least in biological ways, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring with, is that our genome is not taking care of who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories, too. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in an own room is a page from the above comic novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning as she appears with a release-out of hands in the hands of the disciplinaromas of the United States as King-Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they make your speech, then they have won," "says it."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never, never the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greeted me from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get godly, when I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it would be foreseen in the comic book, but if they should do it, then it will be welcomed in the center of the room by their own genomic simulacren, which are like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"that was also focused on how everything was written in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning Stature), where their genetic haplogbook with pencil were written. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had her on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed by Chelsea, like the movement, which hidden behind her liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2391">Sex-robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emerized professor for robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take its rise seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of nipple and type of fingers."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves fun about it but the companies deliver lots of it, and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey with the release of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexpubs have developed from its inflatable partners to robots with a silicone scalp which is warm to the artificial intelligence which is achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adapt his robot correspondingly to his beliefs" "and choose everything from the eye color of the robot by the form of nipples to the type or colour of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it is still disturbing, as many robots have the" personalities, "which would have a Stepford-woman to be progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexpubs have developed to robotic with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appealing, such as bulk solids."</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the true companion Roxxxy Gold Sex-robots with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah." who conveys the impression of relapsing and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," swarming up the site from True Holion. "</seg>

<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibration, why can men then have no roxxxy?" "it is on the website."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex."</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their origin and increasing sophistication point out a darker and deeper understanding of our culture towards a withdrawal from the ideal equality of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not hold a sex robot, and while the FRR notices its rising popularity, they still remain on the edge of consumer culture."</seg>

<seg id="2413">"many people are not strangely or insulting, until they have the free market for this purpose."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is however a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots emerge in a time where the rights of women are threatened, in which there is a president in the White House who has mastered women sexually attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the deterrent aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical images, the humbling body and the extinct eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but in the moment this does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots consists of making a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although with Pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">They want to make their peers that they feel human and imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots represent no real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate yourself from your companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or a background history, nothing that could disturb to independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims the exact opposite: a diet, which is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million and 300,000 in the US, causes stomach ulls and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while those affected are usually advised to alleviate meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner Artenschutzübereinkommen that helps develop an essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins to develop a tolerant intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the gut patrol, to ensure that damaging microbes that hide in food not to penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are able to emulate inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body, without damaging tissue."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experiments, it has been noted that a type of tolerance promoting immuncell cell on mice, which carry a particular bacterium in their intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the components of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacterial and lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a lack of tryptophan rich diet tolerant, less inflammatory bobumps, if the same system is wires with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the Postdoctorate-in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immuncell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study-shrews had such cells, but a different group of the same tribe that had not been separated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"they suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiologists of the mice, the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which usually live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the ones of the mice were found DNA sequenes and there were found six bacterial species that were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were raised in a sterilious environment so that they lacked a intestinal microbiome and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how the bacteria turned on the immune system, the researchers joined L. reuteri in a fluid and then led small amounts of liquid - without unripe immune cells which were isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component has been cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of the tryptophan-Metabolism, which is known as Indol-3-lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers double the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophandicap were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri can develop the cells in humans as with mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said:" "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophanvalues in the presence of L. reuteri lead to an extension of this population.</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen Report on the abuse of abuse encrowned Pope Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report for the misworn scandal with the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisacher, spokesman of the reformist movement" We are Church, "stated after publication against the German press agency, he acquired by the former Rainsburg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year brother of the Benedict XVI of XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church as Müller and Ratzinger her deep regret about his omissions or their then false evaluation of processes would be expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican newspaper" "Osservatore Romano", "however, criticized that in reporting about violence at the cathedral spatzen is measured with" "two measures". ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"in regard to the attacks in Regensburg no one doubt that it must be prevented by" shameful and shameful acts, "but the" degree mediator "," thus the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian, and member of the national Italian bioethics committee. "</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of designate the Catholic Church as a source of all evils, is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal for normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"also Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis, in the interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk:" one would like to go on the church and this is a great frescoes. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"they also pointed out that in her youth" "beats a very normal pedagogical means" "to be done with cheeky children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"they are unfair to use today's standards for earlier decades, because the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with reports on the abuse of abuse, also pope-brother Georg Ratzinger first emerged."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"to injustice, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who was translated with Ratzinger the reminder band" "My brother of Pope" "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take George Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," "he value the results of the final report."</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is included in the 440-page report that is presented by the Bistum Regensburg with the provision of attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" with high plurality "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, there was too Georg Ratzinger who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" in summary, it's possible that Domkapellmeister R. was applied in many cases forms of physical and psychical violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"particularly with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be disastrous."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"in contrast to numerous other defendants, many victims were estimating the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even connect positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was relieved in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr Hesemann, the 440-pages report on the" "incidents of violence" "of violence perpetrated by the Regensburger Domspatzen" "gives an contradictory image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"to the one hand, many students highlight his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and Perfectionary that the economist was wrestful when a Domspatz has no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate his biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you make the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the rear, one has to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger was found at all in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated to eight pages exactly once and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or co-knowledge in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the atrocities in the pre-school are also taking part in the sphere of sphere of sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"at best, it is possible to get out of it too late or not taken seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzenging school, on which he worked, was perceived by practically all respondents said -" "redemption", "" "heaven" "and" "better world". ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"so the broad majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger provides an excellent record, describes it as" warm-natured "," "honest", "" competent "and" understanding, "the guys regularly catered with cakes, biscuits and Bonbons and" "always supplied by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">"merely a minority complained about its perfectionist and its high level of emotionality, which also led to deserts."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he that he knocked not only with chairs and cast the key legs on the ground, but also earns and too freche guys passed on the hair or ears, he himself gave birth to himself years ago, deeply regret and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, for his honorary salvation, however, that such education methods in the questionable time, the 1960s and seventies, were widespread, in both parents and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such discipline methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think of each one of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state-Gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely, the horrific sexual abuse and violence at the school, are the certainly dredhood."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"you ask yourself, whether it is not more familiar with his acquaintance and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have straight forward to him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"at Bavarian Pope many, who have never understood him, still diligently."</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report discharged Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media in connection with the report, it reports a lot about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also put some embarrassment or co-knowledge related to sexual abuse on the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very much no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to be familiar to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to speak with my father or my mother," said a duff substitute for the others, "It was all very embarrassing."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem with the clarification of sexual abuse was and yet is that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if she does not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a beatiated student worded it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which rupnet (Georg Ratzinger) could have had timely findings and would have been able to spend the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd to accept that out of it... Buben longed and clearer or more likely to have opened than to their parents, internatsmen, trust instructors, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you speak to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus, the report comes to the very clear result:" that concerned with the concerned students and / or their environment, the report could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse is concerned is Georg Ratzinger therefore acquitted of every co-knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="2943">"so it cannot be accused, nor prevented him or have brought it to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"that is why there is no reason to associate a good name with these contradictory crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media was much of" "violence" "to read in the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger was accused in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in reporting everything is mixed and rejuvenated to a huge milking of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"however, this is again a misuse of the report."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, there will be clean separated: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the domain, between sexual abuse and violence, we say once, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not chorus of the cathedral-spatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole awful auditor pedagogy, the cases, in which Knaben were randomized and malignites, and among them were drained, unsettled at the Vorschule in Etterzhausen und Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to be fought."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they were already on the Domspatzenging school."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on this one, like most witnesses emphasise the subject of" "preschool" "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">"it was only happy to be escaped, and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even" heavenly "states."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the Domspatzenging school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was already discipline, but there is no expansive violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" "a lot of victims estimates the general humanity of R., and therefore, in numerous cases, despite violence even connect positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">"so at most, there is still the accusation to have looked at."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the Vorschule."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible (so the witness) was nothing to hear, and then again to 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Betraying Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengagements, which the report even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points to this point," that in the pre-school the test continues to be practised. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "in the light of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent inclusion."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was of course at a time when legal clarity was, as the inspector had long been banned in Bavaria too."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they occurred in a legal gray area, just like any one of us probably know."</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate where the affected might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible border had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but you can not say, he has always looked at."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the inspectors in Bavaria was officially abolished in Bavaria too."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis maintained yes, it is unfair to apply the present educational standards to the then time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we have to talk about the" "Fallstrick of Anachronism," "the danger of the past, according to today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse which was abominable at all times and also not for what was broken in the preschement of rebellion and violence against innocent childrons which goes far beyond that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all quite awful and I am glad that it will finally be reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I must take Georg Ratzinger into protection, for all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his funds for disciplining and punishment, therefore ear-stling and at the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then forbidden, it has also kept strictly held."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what picture of his rainbow's time has Georg Ratzinger, because in discussions with you for the book" "My brother of Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the topic test also for the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedikts XVI., tells of his perspective, since the cathedral-spatzen played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I am not at all that there was a strict rule of regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but that must be said once again: without this perfectionist discipline, it would hardly have been possible to form an institution of world trang, true cultural message of Europe and his musical tradition, which went straight twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and bonbons alone, one does not make a huge singer and stand before every success, right in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-winder."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of man have you experienced by Georg Ratzinger for talks on their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through work on the book and in addition, I have seen Georg Ratzinger really well known and again as wonderful, humorous, basic, deep-hearted and savory people, from which one could not imagine that he could not see just a fly somewhat."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I am regularly playing with how many former domestry still keep in touch with him today, 23 years after his Emeriding, to visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was strictly with them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but yet a lovely respect, to which they still look up today and which they even adore it."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly, everything you rejects, are educator methods which were then on the order at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust one man, just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"is the evil intent, which is behind it, just too apparent."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just released, relieved him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the Andes-area, a 93-year old man who has acquired great merits, and without the outside Bayerns and perhaps no one would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen, at last, would finally be in peace."</seg>
