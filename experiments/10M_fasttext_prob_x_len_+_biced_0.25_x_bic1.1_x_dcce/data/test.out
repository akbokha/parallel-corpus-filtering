Jennifer An@@ iston : I will always put in drawers
Jennifer An@@ iston must not always be perfect or successful .
that has clearly stated Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ambiguous .
&quot; I will always put it in drawers , or get caught by the outside label , who usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
&quot; I do not have the desire , always perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; honestly speaking , these things are more of me . &quot;
Jennifer An@@ iston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan &quot; .

gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sport@@ pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournaments in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a little variation with some colleagues on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a first .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses recall their celebrations , they j@@ acked in the fast g@@ allo@@ p home to the feed @-@ ring . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and with it the riding career ended then again .
on satur@@ day Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament branches - again in the vicinity of horses .
&quot; he left himself with his family about the installation of the AL@@ RV , on a horse , he didn &apos;t try to look for photo purposes . &quot;
this was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Sports Centre handed over to the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small Gala in the Golden Sport@@ pyramid .
with awards it lacks the sympathetic athle@@ te .
&quot; Bundes@@ worship Le@@ aders , sil@@ ber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the Year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has taken him already .
the 18th @-@ winner of the Sport@@ pyramid .
&quot; at Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; this award means a great deal to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for it is not only given for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring .
&quot; and so , he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros further . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time Master@@ s@@ si@@ eger was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include the Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ ten Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Sch@@ mit@@ t , the Fairy Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ enal Sch@@ mit@@ t , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the ski@@ pper Al@@ win Sho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the palms of all Erhard . &quot;
many of these sports@@ men had come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part the illustr@@ ative Society went into the Spring@@ stadium where the Lav@@ az@@ za price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ &apos;s and Tr@@ umps Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement T@@ TP - that is both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two US presidential elections are however in control and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , more philosophical difference . &quot;
control of the role of the state .
&quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt rather small , and warning about how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton destro@@ ys the economy to death and regulate death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claims a ump . &quot;
he will massi@@ vely return regulations and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching control reform with lower tax approaches - for individuals and businesses .
&quot; Clinton , on the contrary , says : the state has certain tasks to perform , he has disadvantage and needs money . &quot;
&quot; that is why the taxes for the rich would be increased , she says . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; it has to be invested , say Tr@@ ump and Clinton nearly wor@@ t@@ equal . &quot;
the democratic Candi@@ date announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ap@@ y @-@ wing of the Republi@@ can .
so on Tr@@ ump you could send partial internal discussions .
more evident are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build carbon power stations and resume the coal mining in the USA .
oil @-@ mining should also be possible in so far protected areas - the Paris mi@@ tigation agreement wants to announce .
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to expand and demands renewable energies with their investment programme : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want we are . &quot;
&quot; but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; PP , the transp@@ azi@@ de Trade Agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the United States doesn &apos;t want to isol@@ ate the United States from international trade , but only to protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; this should also be better paid , for example Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger fee .
it wants to increase it on 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage must be , then he says , he should not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand Tr@@ ump , the economy and the citizens want to rel@@ ieve the growth to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics hold him before , so the budget deficit would be even greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who at least want to ask for the rich that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; any fasting woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is part of women who alone flee , almost to everyday life . &quot;
when they arrive in Germany they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers shelter .
there are four women in a big kitchen .
each one has a baby with a maximum of one year old .
one has put her little son in the arm .
he looked into the room with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother rigid on the table @-@ top .
until it notices that it is observed .
it sm@@ iles short and kis@@ sing the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; it is the business leader of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier of social aid offerings in Bavaria , and deals with women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen were stu@@ ffed .
they live in Munich north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment of Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich &apos;s Women &apos;s Aid relief .
recently she was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - also not as visitors .
the exception is a wax in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has done on her escape experience with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because they are politically pursued because they threaten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a hope of hope to Europe . &quot;
&quot; women are far ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh other reasons for the escape : &quot; many ste@@ aling themselves secretly , because they do not see another way out . &quot;
&quot; in her home , they have experienced experience with sexual violence , forced marriages , honorary mur@@ ders , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this drives them away .
on the run this goes on .
&quot; that tractor for example ask for a bottle of water an sexual act , is not r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that as soon as they anchor in Germany , ir@@ re , tells b@@ ahr . &quot;
here too many women in refugee @-@ events would often be considered inferi@@ or and worst if mis@@ used .
&quot; this leads to about 90 percent of women who live in the area of Munich , in Munich , are estimated to be traumati@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are as usual that they have nothing to say .
&quot; or they don &apos;t trust , openly talk about the experience , because the shame is too large . &quot;
&quot; as they often don &apos;t have to help , there are more accommodations just for them , demands B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven District governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , answering some with no . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is no such thing in the governments of the governments . &quot;
&quot; also in Schw@@ aben , women are not housed alone , &quot; says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ks there are in some common areas of floors or own homes only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot;
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it is said : &quot; it is very important that men and women will be separated . &quot;
&quot; lack of privacy or will be taken together for men and women , it may come to - continual violence against women . &quot;
&quot; the laundry rooms should be separated and readily available for women , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel of this protection , you can read in the cont@@ en@@ tion which it gives to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has been around that there are us , we have a long queue , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
general practitioner : demands for new work @-@ amp@@ ons
&quot; a@@ dep@@ u@@ aries have called for their union to obtain new work @-@ amp@@ ant actions in their disputes with respect to a new contract .
&quot; the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) demanded his entire Council , from beginning of September more work measures . &quot;
&quot; the J@@ DC spoke out that ministers had a failed to address the concerns of the contract .
assistance and medical students have agreed on the rejection of a contract in July agreement with BM@@ A .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; pers@@ ist@@ ently quiet &quot; to problems which resulted in the treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board has been coordinated to fully reject the proposed new contract and are concerned with official re@@ negotiations . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today placed a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to escal@@ ate a leading program of escal@@ ating work measures , which starts in early September . &quot;
&quot; disputes resulted in that assistance during the year was sixteen , the first out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
the director of BM@@ A Assist@@ ants Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came after the election to rejection of the agreed contractual conditions that had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
&quot; he divided BM@@ A members during the sessions , who still found before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 Assist@@ ants and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; following the vote , the Minister of Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of foreign ones &quot; ?
&quot; it was a gesture , which ended up a crisis . &quot;
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and to pro@@ claim an official end of the eight month long war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish bac@@ kl@@ ers in the gol@@ ese Hall of St. Petersburg &apos;s palace at the reception , I can not rep@@ el the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles had a mal@@ ign@@ ant , and it was hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for its long @-@ term conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I could not count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but can even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have heard so would never happen anything worse . &quot;
to me the enthusiasm seemed to be the opposite to me .
&quot; but one of Putin radi@@ ant , sustainable bol@@ le showed that the President of Russia had nothing forgotten . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his sub@@ missions : the de@@ ton@@ ing of a Russian campaign on the Syrian border with Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was w@@ anders burned .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to please Russia in his back .
the failure was even greater because it was committed by a alleged friend .
&quot; the v@@ etr@@ ack again to rebuild is difficult , if not even impossible . &quot;
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the public @-@ controlled media carried out a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; once seemed , the Turks seemed to blame for everything . &quot;
the most serious trials were the accus@@ ations of leading officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family from illegal oil stores in Syria would have benefited from the so @-@ called Islamic state .
he has denied this v@@ eh@@ ement .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology of President Erdo@@ gan who he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the benefits of a cease @-@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan requires all the friends which he can get after he contained nearly his am@@ ad last month at a failed coup .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions made Turkey hit hard - especially on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number is decreased by almost 90 % .
travel companies and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights are resum@@ ed .
you count on a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght in the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week projected the state remote to see fruits and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imported goods will be allowed . &quot;
&quot; a report in ve@@ demo@@ sti wor@@ ded it as : &quot; &quot; tourists there for long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West as it was a response to the tried to take power over a weak response .
&quot; to this end , the ongoing Gro@@ ll come across the sn@@ ail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke to move out of the cool atmosphere and decrease the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian leader won a bonus in Ankara that he called for the sovereign government to support the elected government organs . &quot;
&quot; this is well @-@ noted for Moscow , a matter of course , which itself changes a deeper fear of reg@@ im@@ e@@ change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this glo@@ wing palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y it as an analy@@ st once described , &quot; Alliance of outer side &quot; &quot; : two countries that contra@@ ven@@ e themselves from the West and now ign@@ ite themselves . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two still . &quot;
&quot; the largest difference in Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support the opposing views . &quot;
&quot; it could be signi@@ fying that after nearly three hours of first talks , both Presidents were told at the press conference , that they would not even take the issue . &quot;
&quot; the president of Turkey comp@@ ed it to question a question about their differences , while Putin decided to stress this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on how a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dis@@ cord , NATO member of Turkey collap@@ sing the Russian martial jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state will at least once again talk . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
&quot; according to the Board of Directors , the R@@ BS brand should be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the Board of Directors . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with that the R@@ BS brand have joined the global ambitions of the bank .
since then the bank has dist@@ anced itself when she had almost collap@@ sed and saved almost eight years ago .
&quot; at this time , brand str@@ ate@@ gen &quot; R@@ BS &quot; used to protect other end consumers .
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds on sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to the Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she has decided to put more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
&quot; in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized Head@@ quarters and the stock exchanges for Nat@@ west change . &quot;
Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are others , smaller brands for the private customer business , which are received more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was interviewed during a visit tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the RS@@ B brand will become our Invest@@ ors brand as well as the brand that our employees will be busy as we are now becoming a bank of brands .
&quot; as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now , I say that we do not pursue a global goal , but to pursue local goals . &quot;
&quot; each of these marks will be completely different in their own communities , and our employees are working under these brands with the customers . &quot;
&quot; R@@ BS has already announced that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsorship , and that it will increase the perceptions of different brands in its sport sponsor@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of brands , for how do we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal for three years ago , if we had said that we could be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think that you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can try these marks again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;

&quot; I am very happy about it &apos;s going to happen at New@@ market , because I am here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the Ju@@ bel on when he wins the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacles race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached over 4,@@ 300 wins in a recru@@ iting career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 careers . &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern age and it is not a surprise that he has reached this milestone just a few before him .
&quot; it has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that distinguishes it from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma thrilled fans since years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already scored 6,000 prizes , if he was not just a weekend and big tur@@ no@@ ck jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has been a winner in the UK nearly 30 years ago which is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a bri@@ tish race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;

Russia Putin dam@@ ert arm Serge@@ y Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly released his chair Serge@@ y Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the close associate of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to the special commission@@ er for environmental and transportation matters .
&quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is said that Putin has arranged the dis@@ mis@@ sal of his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidency management . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o who has been Ivan@@ ov@@ s replacement since 2012 was appointed his successor .
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he made his conclusion at the prestigious State of Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Krem@@ lin , it is said ( in Russian ) that he was later a protocol and chief executive manager of the government . &quot;
&quot; he said to Putin : &quot; &quot; thanks for your confidence . &quot;
&quot; I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your work as heads of state , and controls the implementation of your instructions . &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov has asked to leave his posts and have recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time of one of the busi@@ est Vladimir Putin &apos;s and works as he works for the Soviet intelligence service to K@@ GB .
as a staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the rod should withdraw his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
he currently knows no one .
&quot; but the official statement - that a man , who once was tou@@ ted as a potentially president , would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - smote great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks on Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; &quot; It is true that I have asked you in early 2012 in a conversation I could almost say - compl@@ ained about four years long . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presidency management for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of Defense .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin former member of the Security Council of K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power in his power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted most . &quot;
&quot; once was believed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , since a third term Putin would violate against the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , close allies Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became prime minister before he became president thirty and a half years later .

Queens@@ la Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion expensive project should be completed by May 2017
engineers have joined the Nord@@ deck of the que@@ ens@@ ary ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to fiction .
&quot; it is the first of four closing of the &quot; covers , &quot; which approach each of the three towers of the bridge each . &quot;
the brid@@ ging section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons concrete , and 46 s@@ lash @-@ silk . &quot;
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion expensive project should be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; economic Minister Keit@@ h Brown stat@@ s took a visit today , and was one of the first who went on the bridge to the bridge . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queens@@ bridge Cros@@ sings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering of engineering of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which alone were used for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the brid@@ ging a delicate activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the complete rolls are in their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks gets a bet@@ ong@@ ation for the deck , what means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge to his place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; the first closure puts a significant milestone at each Br@@ ücken@@ project . &quot;
this fantastic project represents the clas@@ p @-@ tr@@ end@@ setting high and low @-@ wall building .
&quot; after installing the last exit section and its connection with the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck area , we had to make the still existing gap on the north or country side . &quot;
this was reached by dra@@ gging the northern immigration bridge 700 millimeters .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct 2@@ 22 meters long , about 6,000 tons weighs approximately 6,000 tons and had to be drawn up at an ascent of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; the toler@@ ances , since the toler@@ ances , on which the team works , tiny - on each side they bore only a few millimeters . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
saving in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; happiness yet to be alive &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; happiness yet to be alive , &quot; after they were thrown from their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck 13 : 20 BS@@ T alert after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim in safety , while their boat moved out of their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around to revol@@ ved and set us the worst before , &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds made the boat already apart from its range until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved from a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found at a ram without b@@ ail@@ out . &quot;
they all come aboard the coast of the coast and were brought back to the b@@ ail@@ out station .
&quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men who were cast into the water have fortunately un@@ har@@ med and still be alive . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the boat had an emergency , however , these holes occur in the mou@@ ths of the person from the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has awakened over these men today .
difficult hurt - man sti@@ cht on his ex @-@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
&quot; as the police yesterday evening , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcoholic perpetr@@ ate the clothing of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when this entered the apartment , he went twice on her . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was hurt by the hand and the body .
the police could determine the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old , the clothes of his ex @-@ friend destroyed , he called his mother . &quot;
this alar@@ ming as a result of his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm down her brother . &quot;
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
&quot; therefore , she went out of the house with her partner . &quot;
on the street they met the ex @-@ habitats of the man .
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old took his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who is building up affordable housing apartments ?
the SPD and Green Group mean that investors should in future be put more strongly into duty .
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
&quot; the SPD is proposing a &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; &quot; at the next level of meeting . &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
&quot; first of all , the question is about : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ? &quot;
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; SPD presidents Christoph Brat@@ mann believes : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Greens : those who want to build on urban areas will be 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
the cheap apartments can also be found in the stock market .
&quot; however , the great dispute in the city hall was , however , Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you want to build up investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to be at least 10 percent in such areas , but 20 per cent of apartments are building as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new municipal construction program , which will cost millions of costs and is still to be financed , should provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , Brat@@ un@@ mann : &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make investors as few as possible .
the left will still be tough conditions for investors .
&quot; regardless of how viol@@ a , viol@@ ates a ti@@ ghtening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; the scope of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the construction administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the specialists .
&quot; the program is not entirely : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
but how do you like the loss of further around 1300 cheap apartments which will promote boost in the coming years ?
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , so the plan@@ ing policy spokes@@ man Nicole Palm , should now be bought from the city now . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it would have to be thought about , again and again in the price . &quot;
this is possible in the West town .
at one fell s@@ woo@@ p the problem can solve .
because in the West town there will be an end to the end of the year .
&quot; around 1800 apartments , one could get back to the price of cheap apartments . &quot;
only : these are the owners who do not want housing companies .
&quot; for the number of social housing in the west city is again dras@@ tically increased , one away from the goal of the so @-@ called through@@ mixing . &quot;
a concentration of social @-@ weak in just a few districts should not give it any more .
the Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; leader of the Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says , &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must be with the boat . &quot;
&quot; though , I have concentrated on more construction sites for family homes . &quot;
but what does not mean that not yet another compromise can be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; that teenagers and child are no longer going outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time with it , on screens too rigid , has been in the last decade of many acc@@ esses . &quot;
&quot; at Pok@@ emon Go , it is about getting people from the sofa and become more active . &quot;
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to television , then on video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters , which were first created for the video games in the 1990s ( later emerged from it a cartoon , game cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot;
&quot; like many phenomena of pop culture , the interest before the release of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand early July somewhat . &quot;
the market launch in other countries was moved by the massive demand that the server over@@ fed .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go for more users than ink of ink and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the player with their smartphones to be out and look for Pok@@ é@@ mons that are followed with a GPS and once they have been found &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; ( about a scre@@ enshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a generation that played the game as she was still younger , joined the whale and j@@ umped out for the search from the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable rise of steps that the &quot; average &quot; person runs every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ o@@ gram , an app for Apple Watch , which followed 3@@ 5.000 users , distributed the Washington Post recently concluded that within two days of launch of the game , the number of followed people who train every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only looks the raw data to the performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to bring &quot; themselves 30 minutes to get &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; to be active every day , because many public messages are boring and coming from people who look . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sport , reduces his chances of suffering from cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here . &quot;
&quot; but the Wonder@@ ful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun . &quot;
some people even close friends on the hunt .
&quot; as always there are m@@ alls , who always have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what is it to be ?
it has made a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphones , as Fit@@ Bit could already follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its charm and use it with time .
&quot; thanks to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games to unite the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ism in the real world and will help many people in hunting , active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ entur@@ ers
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all this im@@ mu@@ n .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the floor .
on the whole line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympi@@ as .
the 19 @-@ year old American gymn@@ ast er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for multi @-@ struggle title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes below the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
your overall result of 6@@ 2.1 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the silver med@@ all@@ ists and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ ic@@ sk@@ amer@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze statue Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ ers on the pig @-@ beams during the individual multi @-@ struggle for women at the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth hetero@@ sexual American , who wins a multi @-@ struggle title and in total the fifth , while she has fir@@ med their reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
&quot; she broke out in tears , when her final result was shown , and her long journey was an end to this moment . &quot;
this success puts them in the same League as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps who brought her sports to new heights :
&quot; it has dominated the last three years its athle@@ tic , 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises , making a mixture of ambition and precision that she &apos;s the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it was expecting a final examination in Brazil , a competition that went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered a disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americans are Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace with gold and silver in the single multi @-@ year acquisition of women at the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while at the farewell @-@ party he served at the retirement he @-@ ordin@@ ated Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as an exit . &quot;
&quot; although it ins@@ isted on the top , during its long path to the top , never the future is planned , it is not really true . &quot;
part of its b@@ ail@@ ments - which included their typical tum@@ bling passport - is adapted to Latin American music which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grandparents as a small child , and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school@@ ing in the g@@ ymnasium , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has lost no multi @-@ fighting competition , a strainer series which will continue as long as it wishes to do it . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ af@@ ina was easily led by two rot@@ ations , dec@@ eiving the picture . &quot;
sul@@ p@@ sich@@ ord and bo@@ dent@@ ures - in which the world championship holds - lau@@ ghed .
she resum@@ ed with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig @-@ beam - and sat on the ground with a 15 9@@ 33 on the floor .
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ aced her gently as she was supposed to be her end @-@ story - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow in bil@@ y red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision that once described in her collection @-@ book , to reality . &quot;
&quot; the Power Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought the third place , but the bronze medals in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke on Must@@ af@@ ina went . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man @-@ capitalism had been named by the Americans &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; , &quot; a lead . &quot;
&quot; after its flo@@ wering , she cast to the public Kus@@ sh@@ ouse , overwhelmed by a com@@ eback , which was sometimes dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of this week , it quickly became apparent from the start of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims in mass murder when listening in the car
&quot; according to police report that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot in one of the fatal attacks since a decade in the first mass murder of Phoenix , while in the car they stopped in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Andrea Liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah was shot on 12 June while the car was par@@ ted in a tour , said the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the offen@@ ders fired eight shots from a hand@@ fire @-@ weapon , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is in the report to read . &quot;
&quot; the police shared with that the thre@@ e@@ fold murder did not seem to be the result of a rob@@ bery , as the att@@ acker was not the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which were owned by an adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the police officers of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the sho@@ ot@@ ings have led the investig@@ ator to become a closer look at , whether it is connected with four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , predominantly in h@@ isp@@ anic dwell@@ ings were killed in nine months in nine attacks and two others injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , distributed Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , an affiliate of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown n@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that they have led to conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized due to their injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site . &quot;
a witness shared by the police with that it was not uncommon for them to sit in a par@@ ted car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the sli@@ des@@ y , which began on an empty pick @-@ up truck a half hour before the triple murder and came from that it was the work of mass mur@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ eous and secured a ball out of the seat , as well as pu@@ bis fragments from the motor region . &quot;
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it becomes better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old loves Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to the singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; as the least of his aging enjoyed Ed@@ mund micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during their pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought , I won &apos;t . &quot;
I do not create that .
I did not let myself .
&quot; what is not true at all -- of course , one has left itself on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; Vincent and her husband Vincent and her husband has been told that Ed@@ mund she will never realize it , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they suggested to institu@@ tion@@ alise him .
&quot; my first response to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a wal@@ ker .
&quot; Ed@@ mund was neither sitting nor scrat@@ ched until his third year of life , and he can still not speak . &quot;
but he slowly makes progress .
he can run and cycle with support .
he likes to play and sing with his two brothers and sing .
&quot; Elizabeth shows the character language that has turned Ed@@ mund for &quot; &quot; Please send me something out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him string , &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign @-@ language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as well as Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as mas@@ h or the ci@@ ca@@ vi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to say how it will affect the life of the ci@@ ca@@ vi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to remembers the emotional price of a certain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
&quot; I have no longer asked for the prognosis for a long time , because I am not expecting them to really say to me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hopeless advice for mothers of infants with birth defects that were caused by the ci@@ ca@@ vi@@ rus .
it will be better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; fierce rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives rise to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Mississippi
fierce rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana covered the governor to rest on Friday the emergency . it is calculated all Saturday with more rainf@@ all .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ anas and the south of the sea flooded its banks and threatened with large @-@ faced floo@@ ding in extreme rainf@@ all , reported the national weather service . &quot;
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John Bel Edwards shared with that government officials are standing in the constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the road with the local communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Govern@@ ors , shared with that the requests for high water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags are several . &quot;
Ste@@ am said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a would have requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a floo@@ d@@ war@@ n@@ system is used over large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ anas to Saturday .
the Wetter@@ dienst could dis@@ miss that additional 3 to 5 inches in this area could fall in rain .
&quot; in the south of Alab@@ ama , a fl@@ ut@@ ary system was deployed on Friday , while in the area of mobile it continued to rain . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana are all probability reach over the weekend record high@@ s . &quot;
the Me@@ ter@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could stream many houses in the subur@@ b near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a flow @-@ down@@ ward floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger since it can flow slowly into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
&quot; the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ v , south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached on Friday already at 09.@@ 00 the highest stand that was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still sli@@ pped people from the floo@@ ding water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kinson in the South@@ west of Mississippi .

&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually situated more than 400 feet from his house , over night . &quot;
he said that him was a further step@@ son who lives in the vicinity .
&quot; we are awake and the water flowing and flooded in , &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford , that she had lived there in 48 years , in which she had never seen such a flood of the river . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members were all disabled , and he would be the only one that can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that the hel@@ fer would have saved all three in a large military @-@ truck , and brought them to the next fire@@ guard in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding was spread quickly , since there was still heavy rainf@@ alls and that authorities take ev@@ acu@@ ating instructions into consideration . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer held near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil due to rainf@@ alls since Wednesday was considerably complete .
the authorities gave that heavy rainf@@ alls and street sw@@ amps the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and educational failure in five quarters .
the C@@ BS @-@ subsidiaries WW@@ L reported that an ordered in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches now both were flooded .
&quot; the Vor@@ steh@@ er of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven pets , which were fl@@ us@@ hed by the floods . &quot;

&quot; once the water starts back , they will be back into their homes again , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a , almost two de@@ pl@@ ating streets were provided due to the floo@@ d@@ water and sand@@ bags for the residents who are hoping to keep the water from their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last great flood that we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in V@@ pp , the Emer@@ gency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ ay of Harrison Coun@@ t@@ ys , that it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his information , a handful of homes on Thursday was reported as in@@ und@@ ated , but on Friday were not reported until now . &quot;
&quot; Keit@@ h Town@@ son , manager at shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I saw water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; sco@@ ops &quot; , &quot; survi@@ ves late in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police dealt with , that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time being shot a 6 @-@ year child . &quot;
the grandparents of the boy identified it for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grandparents assumed that Brown suffered several sliding injuries , including in the end , leg , arm and belly , but that he was at his transport to the hospital in consciousness . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was per@@ ated by bul@@ lets , distributed his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transm@@ itter . &quot;
I cannot believe that .
the boy &apos;s condition was regarded in a hospital as cri@@ tically and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy shared the transm@@ itter that he is expected to be repeated .
he would have to start the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
&quot; also , three men were aged : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is located in a critical state , shot up , reports the transm@@ itter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police are precisely determined if one of the injured men of the perpetrators could be found .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to be a crus@@ ade between multiple guns .
&quot; pat@@ ron@@ age for storm @-@ pipes , which were rep@@ u@@ pro@@ secuted to different storm @-@ borders , s@@ wir@@ es the scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly a prolonged struggle .
&quot; on the street , on both sides of the walk , were sle@@ eves . &quot;
&quot; in this way , there are several armed fighters to have been involved , which were very actively involved &quot; , &quot; the police skin @-@ p@@ mann Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di police in Philadelphia . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles met in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest , and the police are currently checking for monitoring video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year girl was taken by a squee@@ z@@ ant on the arm , when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she recovered and the police are still looking for a susp@@ ects .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I imagine among the women &apos;s Olympic Games and that from more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I have been doing so dominant since 1984 at each summer Olympi@@ ad and the USA had never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second , this team has three tur@@ ner@@ ers , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspired for many young girls from other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ ine is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , which is ca@@ tho@@ lic , rounds , makes every pride . &quot;
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has solidi@@ fied the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one below the female Tur@@ ner@@ inside was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americ@@ an@@ erin .
last year were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
in the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising olymp@@ a@@ reg@@ ress and America che@@ ered .
&quot; now , the world was able to be a witness of the incredible performance of the triple world in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as she was unexpected , but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics rout@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , hetero@@ sexual American , who won gold at an individual multi @-@ struggle event for women . &quot;
team member of A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are witn@@ essing the tip of this sport , but you do not see the turn@@ around in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all smote all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison , to create it in the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; you are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic Games will only have four turtle inside the team . in addition , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi &apos;s trainers . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks like that Tur@@ nen is a more expensive sport and Tur@@ ner primarily unite in private gym that will be maintained by parents , who pay for training , furniture , travel , and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their tower and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ outs lie in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these verses , the Tur@@ ner receive their entire training and that is for families a more expensive and long @-@ term commitment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer from Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started with the tower . &quot;
&quot; we have to be inspired to the municipalities &apos; innumerable , young girls that are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , provide a high @-@ quality and easier access trainers . &quot;
I was founded my gym of 20 years .
&quot; with my events , we have done free and affordable turbul@@ ence in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors . &quot;
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hometown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ ons which make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this amazing olymp@@ ic sport .
&quot; tur@@ quoise develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , who take thousands of young girls to interest themselves and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
it is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power , &quot; motivated her so many young girls with different background to begin their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance practitioners want to organise further strikes after they rejected Jer@@ emy Hun@@ ts proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over changes by adopting a reform@@ at@@ ant contract with the function@@ ary of British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ ,000 assistant who voted for a vote , refused him down . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t plans was un@@ veiled to introduce the contract , and said that the N@@ HS were in a &quot; &quot; non @-@ land &quot; &quot; and would be harmful to any further delay in the employees and patients . &quot;
the first general practitioner should obtain a new contract to improve the changes to night and weekly work in order to improve care for free movement .
&quot; DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Com@@ bin@@ ed for assistance held last night in a communication with : &quot; Ass@@ istance practitioners have serious concerns about the proposed treaty , particularly that it will be the current staff crisis and administered it to treat all doctors . &quot;
only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract must be made progress and time is running out .
efforts by the BM@@ A to solve the dispute through discussions with the government on the sake of reluc@@ tance and sometimes silence .
&quot; this happened to that of a promise , Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t died last month , that his door would always stop at her time . &quot;
Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t has to act now to raise the penetration and address the worries of the assistance .
&quot; if he should not do so , the assistance have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work @-@ related measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and skilled practitioners were involved in order to give physicians on the strike post coverage . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over changes by adopting the reform@@ at@@ ted contract with the function@@ ary of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A would like to pay a better week@@ fee for the 5@@ 4.000 Assist@@ ants , which are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director of the N@@ HS employees , called for the assistance practitioners to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; working amp@@ utation do not reach nothing of the only little , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , care and their families just worry , distress and interruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we have talked to the comm@@ enting of the assistance of the assistants and the Ministry of Health and other ministries , and the concerns with regard to the tut@@ el@@ age and the wh@@ istle @-@ naked wings . &quot;
&quot; the employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as discharge , flexibility in training courses , training holidays , training and gender @-@ specific wage counterf@@ eit in medicine - a sign that has been the employer , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health to comply with the agreements with BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day @-@ medication that can reduce heart attack
&quot; thousands of heart disease patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , after having been advised by the authorities to ad@@ minister this more people for a longer period . &quot;
the inn@@ inn@@ em@@ ulation drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart attack for people with a reduction disease .
&quot; the drug is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , thus reducing the risk of a stroke and another heart attack . &quot;
regul@@ ators N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has recommended a four year long intake to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
regul@@ ators N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has recommended a four year long intake to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 14@@ ,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and one quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attack and stroke are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the arteries that form the har@@ row .
&quot; when the Occup@@ ation breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ap that causes blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; if the blood cl@@ ap sol@@ ves , it can flow through the flow of blood flow and the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
individuals who had already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ eca and is distributed under the name of Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; the accus@@ ation of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with one twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health prevention center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary schools , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack , or stroke , often with disastrous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing further heart attack and stro@@ kes in people who had already had a heart attack .
&quot; due to the provisional recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are glad that we are able to extend the options available to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
&quot; the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the draft law recommends no treatment , which passes over this period . &quot;
culture of the Political Cor@@ rec@@ tor leaves Ele@@ v@@ ants in Muslim regions flour@@ ishing
&quot; the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on , for Rah@@ man was cancelled last year to dis@@ mis@@ sal a government report on corruption from office . &quot;
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ede has led to wi@@ dened and wi@@ ped wi@@ dened constitu@@ ents in Muslim communities such as a crus@@ hing government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member , Sir Eric Pick@@ les , verb@@ ally the police , constitu@@ tion@@ ers and Rath@@ buildings to have ignored the evidence of electoral abuse on the basis of &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ es and religion . &quot;
&quot; the former Minister for Integration and Community government , who now is a Ant@@ corrupt regime , said that the intimi@@ dation of voters from religious motives should be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up ab@@ rup@@ tions outside of electoral vessels to protect sli@@ pped voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should lead a proof to prove their identity in elections .
at present a vot@@ er must merely call its name and address .
&quot; the report suggests , not distant ink to the finger of a person when she will give her choices to prevent someone to choose twice . &quot;
wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers should obtain more protection says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to municipal and decisions of non @-@ official commis@@ sions or working groups .
&quot; this is not only for electoral fraud , but also the municipal government before the wider corruption and financial corruption culture that goes with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets Leg@@ als in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a Special Tribunal decided that the Mayor of Mayor Lut@@ on for Rah@@ man ought to be dis@@ missed after a L@@ itan@@ ei on corrupt and illegal practices of its Am@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; the court was that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal nature and that he would have sil@@ enced its critics with Rass@@ is@@ sm@@ s and Islam@@ ophobia . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ ig@@ ous duty of Muslims , to choose it . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 votes were either doub@@ ted or the result of im@@ itation , when one person chooses one another . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence for fraud throughout the country .
he expressed particularly alar@@ ming to frau@@ dul@@ ent correspondence - in the older members of the Muslim community printing pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system including the filling of them to prove the identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report it is stated : &quot; as proof , pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the determination of elders , especially communities with Pakistan or mund@@ ane background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions have ignored such a behavior due to &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ es and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric talked to 50 recommendations to clean the system including the prohibition , that political activists deal with op@@ tionally , in order to stop &quot; electoral harvest . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires the tough@@ est registration of registration to prevent that the electoral directory for im@@ migrant and social storage purposes is used . &quot;
consider taking voters prior to choosing your comment .
&quot; do not use remote Tin@@ te on the finger of a person , as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone to choose twice . &quot;
systematic veri@@ fications about the nationality of a person to perform to make sure that they are either entitled .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications based on automatic brie@@ fing .
prohibition to process political activists full brie@@ fing and dis@@ closing arguments .
the police give the authority to set up ab@@ rup@@ tions for election stations .
&quot; a legislative change , which makes an indictment for intimi@@ dation according to the &quot; &quot; representation of the People Act 1983 ( Economics Act 1983 ) . &quot;
photography offered in election stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the voting stations ( except for Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the staff usually enforce that voters alone go into the franchise . &quot;
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it amazing that after the Tower Ham@@ lets no case has been announced .
&quot; the electoral tribunal has declared Lut@@ on for Rah@@ man and his deputy on account of a L@@ itan@@ ei on corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , it was not guilty to meet the high requirements in criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also critici@@ zed the effective &quot; exhau@@ st controls &quot; of the constitu@@ tions of the Rath@@ geber .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court sur@@ part in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country is wearing as the mother of the parliaments a proud heritage , but the worrying and covered spread of electoral and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy for K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger in and other famous Double @-@ go@@ ers of Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ i in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio this week took place over the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot besides the edge and the band who has proved impressive double @-@ limbs in the Duke of Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by far not the only one that has gold batt@@ ling Ath@@ let , who has his own famous twin @-@ go@@ ers - at least not when you can believe the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which are currently fle@@ eting for our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of the Olympi@@ ad that have more than just a certain similarity with Hol@@ ly@@ a @-@ famous . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o . &quot;
&quot; besides K@@ ate Doppel@@ gänger in the Rad@@ ren@@ bahn , many people were on the Internet to see how to be a certain ar@@ cher of the Twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter , after pictures on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star unbeliev@@ ably similar . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher was given the madness into the social media and gave it to hear that he has already heard since his childhood , that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself see no big similarity , with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; said Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I thought it probably as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; one of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly step into the center : the all@@ all@@ ying similarity between the British Prime Minister Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Har@@ ris . &quot;
&quot; the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eyes should be seen as a double @-@ predecessor for the Cub@@ an American singer of Gl@@ oria Est@@ onian . &quot;
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
one course higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor .
a further sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ h who has similar serious eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver @-@ med@@ all@@ ists in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the sun@@ ni@@ fied skin and bl@@ ond hair such as the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne McC@@ ord during the Americans Nathan Adrian of fans att@@ ested with an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes &quot;
not the only ones : a Twitter user was very happy that others like the similarities to others
theory placed in space : according to this user there is perhaps a reason for the similarity of the couple .
&quot; a Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in explained their satisfaction , that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the U.S. football star Hope solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar facial form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular comparisons collected from Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical with the von act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , who has her own beautiful , broad smile that resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

&quot; the Canadian transm@@ itter C@@ BC had to apologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers went in &quot; &quot; like mad &quot; &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the comment@@ ator Byron Mac@@ Don@@ alds thought that his microphone would be off , when he at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ isti@@ l@@ sch@@ kn@@ ay gives his own opinions . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ don@@ ald that had been fet@@ ched into the comment@@ ator ente@@ am of the C@@ BS , to give more &quot; color , &quot; you could hear : &quot; this little 14 year @-@ year Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , went away like mad , died like a pig . &quot;
thanks for this .
&quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of swimming staff@@ el 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1,@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which made it possible to close the gap to China . &quot;
&quot; the audience in all Canada reacted quickly , after they were shocked by the sound and the language . &quot;
&quot; saw the C@@ BC comment@@ ator , &quot; Do@@ es the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer@@ ing in China &quot; like a pig has died ? ? ? ? ? ? &quot;
the idi@@ ot did not get broken that they were still on show .
&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m Fre@@ isti@@ l@@ sch@@ kn@@ ay for women as follows : &quot; this small 14 year @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the review against Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard on which many questions came to speech
Twitter users didn &apos;t stop back when they heard how uns@@ ensi@@ tizing Byron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ mon Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you are presenting the C@@ BC and Canada only and lets us look like rac@@ ists . # noted .
&quot; a short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live , live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; we apologi@@ ze that the comment has been broadcast over a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was a unhappy formulation , we are sorry that it has happened . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BC apologi@@ zed at the end of more than 90 times at the people , who have responded to the comments about Twitter . &quot;
the comment@@ ator Col@@ line Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ olog@@ ise in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
&quot; C@@ BC kop@@ ated and added his ap@@ ology at more than 90 other Twitter servers , which had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
the network also apologi@@ zed quickly and gave a message .
&quot; we regret it sincerely , that these statements were made and that it was possible to be broadcast . &quot;
last night we quickly apologi@@ zed with our viewers on show and our Fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in the social media .
&quot; to clarify , B@@ yr@@ ons comments related to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers in and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and a miserable wording . Byron does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention , that it is not intended as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to take a moment to apologi@@ ze for the comment , which I made after the C@@ BC Olymp@@ us , to apologi@@ ze , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have sat down on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers , and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark outra@@ ged over women who tried in the middle of business ling@@ erie
&quot; the buyers did not know where to see them , when a woman moved their clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try to try sub @-@ pants . &quot;
&quot; in order to wor@@ sen the situation , they numbered them as it looked at it , she drew off and put it back into the shelf . &quot;
she continues and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the Pri@@ mark shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson who had tried at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear to buy it again and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the outlets , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the base , pulled off their own strains and pants , and tried them . &quot;
she didn &apos;t even try to find a dis@@ crete place to do it - she simply was there . she was just like O@@ sk@@ ar .
&quot; each star@@ ed when they pulled back the under@@ pants , which you obviously did not like them , as they put them into the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three other tro@@ users before she finally decided that her was nothing left and went out .
it didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b it that they watched someone - or think about the person who would like to buy the under@@ pants they had tried .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent said , &quot; How contradic@@ tory to think that someone would attack a person who had a different person and which were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; as I took part , the staff have tried to pull the garments from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
&quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants , and find out that another woman had her and returned , and they were not washed away . &quot;
&quot; Mr Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday , 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question were taken out of sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from ceas@@ e@@ fire attacks
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to walk with armed rob@@ bers on distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how you revol@@ ve for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; when one crosses yourself from behind , then you should turn off as a check , so that you can see your att@@ acker and move out of the touch , &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
grab the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free el@@ bows to face .
&quot; then hit him with your knee in the bar and shoot , while the att@@ acker is collap@@ sed before pain , the weapon from his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move back@@ wards while they set the weapon on it . &quot;
&quot; at att@@ ackers , which approach itself from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the touch line , grab the weapon and rot@@ ate them so that the att@@ acker may not shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time shift the weight into the gun and hit the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the weapon from his handle before they move back@@ wards and set the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how there is Miz@@ ra@@ chi Pre@@ fecture .
&quot; however , remember that it is most secure for you to transfer your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master . &quot;
travel@@ er Ian Wright sch@@ y for a guide to his tongue on the dirty places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and wor@@ ef@@ le@@ x a serious test - by le@@ ased some of the dirty and ek@@ el@@ est places of Europe .
&quot; the present@@ er and travel@@ er Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k picked up his course on a Euro @-@ Sch@@ ein , a rail@@ ing on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a sink kno@@ b , as well as a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of its immune system . &quot;
&quot; before picking each object , he used a l@@ umin@@ ometer to show itself and to show us what he will let . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was fil@@ tered under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to day@@ light . &quot;
&quot; the thought , the r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ b has been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact they are in a kitchen sin@@ le more bad bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke with physicians and medical specialists about the promotion of bo@@ wel bacteria as well as his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left that he stretched out more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright was known to test the resili@@ ence of its intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and ate peculiar as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to railway stations to a flush of toilets , the task presented its immune system definitely under a sample &quot;
&quot; he told the film : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns , and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms , and s@@ lu@@ d@@ water . &quot;
in the film he was able to do justice to his reputation .
&quot; the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot;
his trial line showed a l@@ umin@@ eter number of over 4000 units .
&quot; compared with this , the L@@ umin@@ eter number is more fresh or less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to cut off after their l@@ umin@@ ant figure was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o manufactured the Reis@@ ef@@ il@@ m &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number in different locations like the bathroom . &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; This comes the worst thing I have been in a toilet , near . &quot;
there is nothing bad than that !
&quot; I will not touch here , because it is here in@@ doors . &quot;
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company st@@ ado@@ wed Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D , to support the promotion of bo@@ wel bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiot@@ ics .
we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that ended with that we told &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot;
claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
&quot; also , I think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour ! &quot;
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the Director of the film , added : &quot; let me tell me so - I would have tasted my respect for Ian when he would have reli@@ eved some of things that I have reli@@ ed to him , like the ek@@ el@@ ective Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was simpler to bring Ian to touch it and others , where this was quite difficult . &quot;
glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents carried out in 2015 , in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said they are at least occasionally used products , which included l@@ actic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social family destroyed prior to Del@@ o@@ gi@@ val social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left her social apartment after a del@@ isting with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 because they terror@@ ising their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , we found the property of the property in an irre@@ par@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; the walls were ru@@ gged holes , wood di@@ mp@@ s were ri@@ pped up , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls . &quot;
the family were surrounded and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the management of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that they feared that the apartment was no longer repair . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
&quot; there are many things to consider , since this property is likely to be considered as a beautiful part of Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that had attached the family , street fights with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ele , intimi@@ dated by people , drug abuse , drug trade , and excessive cry , streams and fluctu@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which will be demol@@ ished under circumstances , old cra@@ p was found . &quot;
&quot; they were acted in the estate in which drugs have been tra@@ ded , the wood@@ lands . &quot;
&quot; neighbours said they had to fight them on the streets , and regularly initi@@ alled the police . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ ded it and its partners this week for@@ ci@@ bly by the estate , after offering them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to volunteer . &quot;
Del@@ o@@ gi@@ val were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors that told her life to hell .
&quot; one said : &quot; &quot; they did not see anybody . &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
&quot; the countless times , which we say the police here are incredible . &quot;
&quot; today tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood there because it was so quiet here - that we are not accustomed !
&quot; now , where they finally are gone , it will become nice . &quot;
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it had been ad@@ minister@@ ing the family with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police was called in regular intervals , 20 years &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ thrown side of the municipal house , trash and old toys were thrown down . &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that there is the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family since a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ver is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing takes into consideration . &quot;
it was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extremely difficult and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbours .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have gr@@ ace@@ ful to us and have received the information we have made . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this development will take a few neighbours in comfort , and the message is given that anti @-@ social behavior is not toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they are all over 20 . &quot;
&quot; a dirty mattress , which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house according to Del@@ o@@ gi@@ val on the ground . &quot;
workers of the house management will now have to for@@ ge garbage dump the house that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 the police took a raid on the house , and found more than 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ es and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a donation after having found guilty of the own@@ ing of a class B in trade review .
&quot; she asser@@ ted that money for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don was , who came in 2013 with a car accident . &quot;
&quot; after they were without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner will now live in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many of the rooms of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
police says that they will do tenants who do not stick to the house order
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall shared with that the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ val is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not stick to the house order .
&quot; this goes to those who think they can live without self @-@ accus@@ ations , as well as those who have been damaged by such behaviour , &quot; she said . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

&quot; this was the moment , in which fri@@ ghtening tourists start to panic into panic , after a ti@@ eff@@ ected jet cras@@ hes over a full beach . &quot;
dramatic video recordings were seen as the military plane nearly in reach on the sun @-@ section on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the holiday makers pointed out as they were understand@@ ably beginning to make worries about the noise of the bowls , without first seeing what was coming through the clouds on them . &quot;
&quot; the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many holiday@@ makers , watching videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media : &quot; &quot; it flew twice very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would overthrow it . &quot;
&quot; N@@ uno arrogan@@ ce added : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane crash down . &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were panic when the plane came out of darkness and flew incredibly deep .
&quot; the Portuguese air forces had announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Orion aircraft was on a training flight , to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them . &quot;
&quot; the speaker said that the jet did slightly deeper than usual due to bad visibility , however , the air forces pers@@ isted that security at no time was at risk . &quot;
&quot; area fires have destroyed this summer &apos;s parts of the Portuguese feast , in which four people came to death in the island of Madeira . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese air forces had announced today that the pilot had to fly due to the conditions - heavy fog , and br@@ anded as well - so deep that its perspective ent@@ ails . &quot;
the plane was on a workout flight when the pilot fishing boats had to identify as part of the exercise .

&quot; so far , Coach Luis Enri@@ que was looking at a clear decision so far and left Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er ste@@ gen in most other applicants . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory match of the new game period , there are doubts about the fitness level of the crew , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
&quot; also at 3 : 2 in the rehearsal room against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria , on Wednesday , Li@@ on@@ el Mess@@ i and Co. are not really convincing . &quot;
&quot; in Seville , the 2 : 3 defeat after renewal in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid has to di@@ gest and asp@@ ire the second triumph for the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot; &quot;

bronze went to the Japanese Jun@@ n@@ ani .
the two Chinese have made it as expected in the final game and made the title one another .
&quot; thus , it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would pick up the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings . &quot;
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympia stair@@ cases was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang on the record alone had left to the record , between sets and in time outs , they had no co@@ aches with themselves . &quot;
they had withdrawn on the tri@@ b@@ une and left their shot at the fair competition alone .
&quot; the Mat@@ ches to here , I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the finale I play for myself , &quot; &quot; had said Z@@ hang following . &quot;
after the Parti@@ cip@@ ated gold and silver med@@ all@@ ists with the China Flag .
the match itself was unexpected .
Ma was only able to fight with his 28 @-@ year opponent only in the first sentence .
&quot; after that , he determined the pace in the record , and dropped off as only a total of 13 points . &quot;
the superiority of Ma did not develop the expected swe@@ eping match .
but nevertheless enough breath @-@ change were to be seen .
Mi@@ re@@ ani won the game for Bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; the white ar@@ usi@@ se had moved in his quarter @-@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , a ri@@ b violation , was then in medical treatment , had to settle for &quot; &quot; ultimately &quot; &quot; with metal . &quot;

Donald Tr@@ ump spatial ″ huge problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative German states to stand up their majority . &quot;
presidential elections : Donald Tr@@ ump now gave weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Utah .
&quot; a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ lane and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire , such as concerns vo@@ iced , as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within one &apos;s own Republi@@ can camp , now the doubts about his success in the struggle for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump from evangel@@ ik@@ al Christians , which he asked for support in important federal states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; to blame are false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he took his well @-@ known media . &quot;
Republi@@ can Hoch@@ bur@@ sts w@@ ack@@ eln
Utah is normally a secure bank for the Republi@@ can .
&quot; a survey conducted by Sur@@ ve@@ y@@ USA from June , according to Tr@@ ump and his F@@ entin of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , equ@@ als . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see tr@@ ump in the front , but not by the distance that are common to Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state . &quot;
&quot; as a danger , Arizona and Georgia are considered at risk . &quot;
&quot; in an interview on the Senate of CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump rep@@ lied to the question as he wants to stop the march of Clin@@ ton : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and whether behind : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
&quot; he does not make anything else , as &quot; the truth to tell . &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich for him at the end of the political correctness , be it in order , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to the press report , the party Tr@@ ump will have to risk funds to support his election campaign , he should not present better transformations . &quot;
instead of what the candidates of the re@@ public@@ ans be stronger for Congress stronger under arms .
Olympia : Dre@@ ister fraud at D@@ oping @-@ Test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ commission .
K@@ eni@@ as Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ ten threatens the second D@@ oping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after a fraud test in a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a coach home to Kenya . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee shared with soon to set up a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ commission to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had communicated that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s Coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , released a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runners F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i . &quot;
this is the team@@ leader Kenya had been reported by the dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; the World Association IA@@ AF has asked the IO@@ C to provide information about the case to have their own studies , shared an IA@@ AF speaker . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following actions of the IO@@ C the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; says it in an IA@@ AF declaration . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the dop@@ ing control station and turned out to be F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , the rehearsal and signed , &quot; &quot; declared Kas@@ eni@@ as Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I . &quot;
&quot; he was owned by the ac@@ creditation of athletes , who stood on the list for training controls in the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency . &quot;
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was about 800 meters in 2015 .
four days before the Ken@@ yan Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics delegation Michael Rot@@ i was deduc@@ ted from the Rio games .
he is to have informed against cash payments in his country over @-@ standing D@@ oping tests .
media report says that he was arrested in Nairobi at his return at the airport of Nairobi .
&quot; in Kenya , at the IO@@ C after numerous D@@ oping periods have been under special observation for a long time . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement of the IO@@ C &apos;s announcement made more than 2000 D@@ oping targets prior to Rio @-@ games , it was previously noted that athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into sight . &quot;
&quot; the World @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functional control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before Olympia @-@ beginning .
&quot; as a result , W@@ ada Kenya took place from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing fighting with the rules of W@@ ada are . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the funeral of the country won the most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports , the ARD reports have been re@@ pro@@ ached , that in Kenya D@@ oping means are easily accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of the athle@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently requested a similar study in Kenya , as he had put them in Russian suffering . &quot;
&quot; in this case , it was proven that this sport @-@ art was built @-@ up and systematically tr@@ acked . &quot;
Russian Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ ans were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival will present the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Julia . &quot;
with this a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a Musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; the artistic director Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical , and filled with the role of Mary a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; in orchestr@@ al , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ elan Di@@ ri@@ gen@@ ed Gust@@ avo Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm . &quot; &quot;
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody .
&quot; it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say we Bern@@ st@@ eins music really have in our blood !
in this staging Bart@@ oli plays an older he@@ e Maria .
she remembers with melanchol@@ y to her love with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances . &quot;
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
&quot; so she is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she resembles me very , my Italian character , which I found as a Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the Opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enormously important human being .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compliments back : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
rigi@@ dity is for him a necessity .
&quot; one sees it in any of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with it .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip World Championship . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; : &quot; in this piece , it is about prejudices and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , at that time , the Pu@@ j@@ ans have gone to New York , and the New York &apos;s inhabitants did not want it . &quot;
&quot; these are the same topics , and they are just as meaningful today as they were at that time . &quot;
59 years later the piece is still relevant .

apparently he is the view that it is the Calendar too .
&quot; we must return to the representation of timeless and classical s@@ nu@@ dity , in which both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release on the publication of the cal@@ en@@ dar@@ s . &quot;
women are going to participate in this project because it is a beautiful artwork .

Turkey : Kurdish community counts with mass evasion
&quot; whoever does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed caffeine , &quot; says the name of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , the Kurdish community in Germany expects ten thousand of those seeking to flee from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term it could even be &quot; &quot; some hundreds of thousands &quot; , &quot; the exile @-@ president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; due to the hard drive of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup , the Kurdish community expects a mass cur@@ sed to Germany . &quot;
&quot; at short notice , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of thousands , medium term , with some hundreds of thousands of citizens from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime further fought the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the &quot; Le@@ aders &quot; Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government came over months ago in strongh@@ olds with Stra@@ in@@ tions , 500,000 Kurds inside Turkey on the run . &quot;
after the van@@ ished put@@ sch had yet se@@ cular and op@@ position@@ ists ethnic Turks .
many will want to restart in Europe if they are to be sup@@ pressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that strikes themselves refugees , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the exile compl@@ ained the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
thus Erdo@@ gan increase the expul@@ sion on the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been wi@@ ped out or sold in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U member . &quot;
&quot; the President called for the Federal Government to become &quot; &quot; sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot;
also in Germany find a &quot; Hex@@ en@@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics .
I feel no longer in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement feared also the escape of many Turks .
&quot; more Turks are seeking asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition . &quot;
the Brand@@ marking as Gü@@ len p@@ endant destro@@ ys teachers and other academics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed bags , by the way also the Kem@@ alist and se@@ cular , &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ related Foundation Dialogue and Education , The World . &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reported by calling on figures of the Federal Ministry of Department , the Turks presented the biggest group of the asylum entitled for political persecution in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; at the point of June 30 , these are 11.@@ 3@@ 91 people and therefore under 29 per cent of all considered eligible to be recognized as asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , there is not that war , poverty or the fu@@ tility of conscience . &quot;
&quot; asylum entitled to the Basic Law are exclusively political , so by the state of the state , individually per@@ secuted . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; to where , where it we@@ h@@ eth &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : locals get nothing of the summer campaign with - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia may not choose the land day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern it was understood .
&quot; to 2021 will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for silly as far as far , it is not about : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ day struggle - that is bites . &quot;
the locals who are to be convinced by the defen@@ ders are on vacation .
&quot; most of the tourists who are in the country are on the way , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are no locals , so may not choose the land day . &quot;
&quot; these are practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters infl@@ atable , ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , and end up in the end , only lab@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; up to 4 September 2016 , the electoral and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has once again to be gone by a campaign against the people of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , is now in pol@@ ls clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; exciting , how strongly new@@ com@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; S@@ ell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 leader , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive electoral campaign , one sees from his grandparents . &quot;
&quot; he travels across country , spread ro@@ ses and ch@@ atting a little with the people , just as it was already his legendary liter@@ al predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , sailors got stuck and gives chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel to blame on the flo@@ wering of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; We create this &quot; have accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing popul@@ ists , which will now probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its peak candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced as it is , when you make the wrong time at the right place of election campaign . &quot;
she has invited two chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to wholes@@ aler from Merkel ; Merkel &apos;s Bundestag in the Nor@@ theast is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group was not agreed , there were more Nor@@ dr@@ h@@ ein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; this was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it too bad not to listen to anybody from other corners of Germany , even Angela Merkel . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the northeast @-@ CD@@ U is largely disp@@ osed to the usual electoral campa@@ igning on market spaces and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and air balloon . &quot;
&quot; so , Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; sub@@ ordinate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also noted that in the country , it is the base that it must be very strict to find a wire back to the people . &quot;
&quot; you are like the left , the SPD , the Greens : in the times of the country there is hardly any way . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U comb@@ at@@ ant Kok@@ ert to his collaborators is also self @-@ exposed : &quot; they must go there , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party needs to be used . &quot;
&quot; because a lot is on the game , cel@@ ering its SPD has now called for a particularly committed election campaign . &quot;
in surveys the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 the SPD had yet clearly been won by 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; the Greens , small party with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , are likely to create the jump into the land day . &quot;
&quot; they make a modern virtue of the holiday , a modern virtue , and put their electoral battle at the internet . &quot;
&quot; online Elec@@ tions &quot; , &quot; it calls the state @-@ president Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the green warri@@ ors will take part in finding a native search for local stimulation among the tourists . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the top @-@ can@@ did@@ atin , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a house@@ boat through the mur@@ kl@@ ists lakes and finds it even more beautiful . &quot;
&quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : guest facilities suffer from block@@ age
&quot; on the speed , with which the B is san@@ es , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for building construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 clock in the morning and only end up against 20 clock , there is no praise . &quot;
&quot; they did everything fairly z@@ ack@@ y , &quot; &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no default .
&quot; the construction site was scheduled to move on the weekend to half @-@ time plann@@ er to the south , until the end of October everything should be done . &quot;
&quot; the ab@@ orig@@ ination will also be praised for construction workers , e.g. when it comes to the establishment of homes . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday to the south , the block@@ age of the asphalt road in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was removed and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again lifted , the traffic situation is relaxed in the place . &quot;
the citizens can now run both from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 .
the traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were partly considerable complaints , &quot; &quot; says the responsible management of the re@@ organization director Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach@@ ar road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner street and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many sha@@ ves were searched and rather their Nav@@ i trusted than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to some types of trucks in residential areas f@@ fran@@ ste .
&quot; since the speed limit has not been observed , the municipality requested the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable survivors , &quot; says King , who made himself a location on location . &quot;
there have been two to three per minute lit@@ res .
the fastest was traveling with 77 hours of hour at the pace @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has moved , it has become more quiet . &quot;
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg is now the road again open .
business@@ men don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment has led to them to sales performance , everyone is asked to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; , &quot; thus , for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has hardly consequences . &quot;
&quot; in the car of Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; most slight decline , &quot; but also one that is of course missing &quot; the tre@@ adm@@ ills . &quot;
the most vulnerable are the local restaurants along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have made it &quot; hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it l@@ acked the customers from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil . &quot;
we must be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; the revenue figures rose to &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the road@@ side took its operation &quot; &quot; by two years &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he had to release half of his employees .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been released , the policy would have been different . &quot;
&quot; instead , the president Jörg Schmidt on a request of G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial balance , with the reference , the hosts benefited otherwise from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now , they also need the disadvantages that arise through the rehabilitation . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties where such a large number of people have been handled .
&quot; for all charges , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been settled since 17@@ 15 , he points to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars now account less frequently because of the complicated transportation of transportation , it can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you cannot ride , it is also somewhere nice . &quot;
&quot; that his tribal wall comes back after the end of the refurb@@ ishment , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BS@@ E and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner keeps the effects of B 27 @-@ construction based on his client &apos;s greatest crisis which has experienced its hospitality in their long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , this is brutal . &quot;
constantly in the name of the terrorist struggle against law is bol@@ ted .
&quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick security package . &quot;
but what has a d@@ ul@@ ence status with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ enable partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; all of his proposals were politically reasonable , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new safety packages . &quot;
you are asking for anyone .
&quot; others , additional points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I will also participate in the participation .
&quot; but when the Interior , he was on the outcome and in a &quot; &quot; for@@ dable consensus &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach , a little time after the recent attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach presented a little time before it presents its conclusions for the safety of the Republic . &quot;
but they are all the more extensive .
&quot; a lot has already been known , announced that a new security office should take care of the tu@@ b@@ und communication , is not new . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU guidelines for passenger data and weapons . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the safety authorities does not come surprising .
&quot; in part , the Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second startup for proposals that have not been able to make with the SPD so far : he wants to crum@@ ble sympath@@ ies for terrorist groups , and jihadists with double citizenship in the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be tough points for the SPD , &quot; called the CD@@ U @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he still consider this to be reasonable and demanding , but no opportunities in case of co @-@ ordin@@ ates whatsoever . &quot;
a few new ideas presented at the Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
some of them have been in themselves : he plans to de@@ port@@ ations for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for de@@ tain@@ ement of people before deportation .
refugees trying to be fet@@ ched into the country before they are supposed to check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security examination .
&quot; for distr@@ acted asylum seekers , he wants to put some worse still worse than until now - such as those who commit crimes , or raise their papers in order to wear their identity . &quot;
some of it is politically and legally healing .
man@@ ches also has un@@ earth@@ ed and leaves questions open .
&quot; and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of thought , for example - does the question arises : what does this actually have to do with certainty and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , say de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not sure that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Wür@@ zburg were refugees . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , a lot of people were worried about the high level of refugees concerned about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that are deeply employed people , did not cling to election times in election times . &quot;
the internal security is enormous in the focus .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are electoral fights . &quot;
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly confronted on the issue of internal security .
in the last days between the two parties went high .
&quot; only a gar@@ sti@@ ff dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a safety policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior , in which the res@@ ists also call a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also pain@@ t@@ able tones here .
from a return from the double pass he gets nothing .
we have freezing the discussion in Germany .
&quot; make new up , be not useful . &quot;
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether its own package is un@@ constitutional at all corners and whether it is &quot; reasonable &quot; is for the co@@ ali@@ enable partner , it has to be revealed only . &quot;
there is quite a lot in what could do for dispute .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently trying to pro@@ claim himself on the issue of internal security . &quot;
&quot; Party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes first with careful talk and says : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to safety further . &quot;
Volkswagen comes Volkswagen g@@ lim@@ p .
&quot; despite diesel @-@ scale , the pay@@ load figures are rising worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets it is running around .
&quot; in return , there is Wir@@ bel for a term . &quot;
Volkswagen will start with the ship@@ ments in the second half @-@ year .
&quot; in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ run markets , the biggest car@@ makers can continue to offer a plus thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ run markets . &quot;
&quot; however , in July the core brand VW , above all in Western Europe , and it is hard to see the overall sale , as the companies listed in D@@ ax . &quot;
the world @-@ selling brand VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year . &quot;
in the homeland market Germany acc@@ esses the supplies to almost one six@@ ths .
CEO Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July above all on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; moreover , in some nuclear markets , it has also given a changing economic framework . &quot;
&quot; apart from the situation around the coup in Turkey , British V@@ ot@@ um was also deb@@ ited for leaving the EU and explained a speaker . &quot;
&quot; in the US , where the car@@ bure@@ tors first escal@@ ated first , there is also a minus to book . &quot;
large stand for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the mainly affected domestic brand of the Lower Saxony already continues through the diesel scandal : after the first seven months only a minus minus of 0.@@ 9 percent is at 3,@@ 37 million vehicles to be@@ ech . &quot;
consolidated balance by Fred Kap@@ pler from January to July was able to present a sales stand out from January to July .
&quot; 1,3 percent more vehicles delivered to Volkswagen at this time , around 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software subscription .
&quot; alone in Germany , VW employs some 2.5 million cars for re@@ armament to the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the re@@ armament , VW , that the renovation of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting of the vehicles , it does not give any deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor output . &quot;
&quot; the Autobahn offer the customer after re@@ armament a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it meant on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
reason is legal nu@@ ances .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen provides its German customers now a guarantee for steady diesel models .
this was confirmed last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the Traffic Department has been confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has the requirements of my investigation commission and the KBA &apos;s work to be fulfilled . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of these are not accepted , &quot; &quot; declared Federal Minister of Alexander Do@@ ing ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that for fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine output after re@@ armament no deterior@@ ations take place and all type approved vehicle values have unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not as it was in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; in the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; , Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers come back for example a half year after re@@ armament approximately with an engine in a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that there are any other damage caused by any other damage that has nothing to do with regard to potential warran@@ ties , as it was meant . &quot;
&quot; this is why VW use the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich austerity - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just about 139 customers , the 40 million euros at Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily cash accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case and does not see a signal : normal Spar@@ er would not have to fear , to pay for their spar@@ se criminal offen@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; bearings banks spend money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay for 0,@@ 4 percent criminal offen@@ ders . &quot;
this charge requires the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on pl@@ ro@@ - or daily cash accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs in the future 400 euros a year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; he has been around 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the other , and that it could not fail . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and do 0.@@ 4 percent expense , &quot; said the bank chief . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can not lay up for each million 4,000 Euro . &quot;
the cost of which he will give after the caus@@ ation principle .
&quot; the cash simply lie in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have experienced four incidents , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! &quot; , &quot; said the bank stood . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and are rarely based on other assets .
only a few hikes to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative union of Bavaria explained : &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is causing considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; it is not possible to wear alone , be &quot; &quot; economically durable &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their charges on account , credit cards or instructions . &quot;
&quot; with offen@@ ders for deposits of three million euros , the Thur@@ in@@ gian Pop@@ ular and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank was made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 head@@ lines . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive leader of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay for deposits , the competition in Germany is much too strong for banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a banker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a cliff , which is equipped with a little bit of exu@@ ber@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; this can become a small bank for a small bank , if it is free of charge for money . &quot;
&quot; the genome of the cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ love , Cre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; in the region live known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; the cooperative union of Bavaria &quot; is currently no further banks , which calculate a projection for deposits of private customers , &quot; said Mr Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Bundes@@ verband of the German People &apos;s banks and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ banks ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had explained in the end of June : &quot; the threshold , to go to the Neg@@ ative , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is hard , and it dro@@ mes the emigr@@ ation of investors to competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany will not have fallen in the width .
destination plates : who does buy sound plates ?
lonely men middle @-@ age love plates .
&quot; before making a comment to over@@ saw it under the pseudon@@ ym of non @-@ aging men with harsh insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the disp@@ arities of sound plates did not want to be seen on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the novel@@ ty of physical objects but attributed to Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who have recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght at the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyers .
it is also not a horror by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older records reserve their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but vote the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on television , I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and wild , before I ste@@ al , my hands hold and something certain of the saying , &quot; &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let &apos;s take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart of So@@ hos is slowly involved in his charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sal@@ es@@ men were located - there are still a handful of fantastic records . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to be@@ g the camera for the next part where I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to cher@@ ish their age and mind by observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 which I use of S@@ ister Ray ( Daten@@ report : two young women , three men aged men ) to the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Daten@@ report : eight men middle ages , a woman , probably about the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill the couple of hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , question I ? &quot;
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; these sound plates , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I am not sent to it home ) , dress up the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he possesses a considerable number of albums and singles , the result of his available income : he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford , when they had appeared and once again buy objects that he sold , when he was young and ple@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early 70@@ ies which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things that I probably was too young to buy it me , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who are buying the boards are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
this is my push .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers that he meets to apply the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the medium , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and set yourself to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the discussions that I have led , people generally have been emp@@ tied in order in 1998 or in 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to get back their records again , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of the turn@@ table of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
&quot; it takes only a few seconds in a shop like ph@@ onica , in order to recognize that there is a soothing community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the non @-@ contact payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record @-@ fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of familiar sil@@ pl@@ atten@@ ds , of objects , the happy Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ inn@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material goods than a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
this is true with me as collectors so and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to employ spiritually .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; fl@@ utes a staff of a record stack .
&quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month , they have not yet heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % possess a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , do not have a record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried , while at a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova Comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( Daten@@ count : three men middle @-@ aged ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the Revi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone came just recently here and said , &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead Sh@@ plate , so I can put them into the shelf , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a great percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more manufacturers , less musi@@ c@@ tual . &quot;
&quot; we have people , who say , &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not elderly , who are not slow to come . &quot;
&quot; stop@@ over , which has dedicated to the record of sound nearly a whole floor , has a little audience when I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ ager and women middle age . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the pre@@ standing stores - Wild Be@@ asts neu@@ ros@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ tu@@ cked pop , instead of experimental jazz , out of the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks quite lonely , but na@@ ve mental trau@@ mas are hard to imagine if one stands next to someone 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around in business for a few minutes and looks at the vari@@ ance of the plates for sale . &quot;
it is rather a shop her@@ edi@@ tary as a big purchase .
&quot; it does not earn a lot , so the collecting of records is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or another way but the beauty of records is ... it drives with a loved si@@ gh si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
&quot; my last stop is a business , of which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban out@@ f@@ it@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; while I lay the semb@@ lance that je@@ ans je@@ ans hot@@ spot , I observe a group of young teen@@ ager , group@@ ed for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and his daughter contem@@ plate , to buy a Cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a blend of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody looks at it - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to put it . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; however , considering that every attraction for these items will mean more money for the industry and some customers can send in the depths of so@@ ils for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my research inquiries made that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave , at least in record business in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record companies that exist in reality , record business and in Online@@ . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday tomorrow not with the b@@ um@@ ble through records of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they avoid the rigid view of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator , who over the shoulders rises nothing of the middle aged men . &quot;
the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k is the longest living cycl@@ ist - Vide@@ om@@ i@@ cht

French dish : offering an offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; French court has rejected an offer of authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , living in the thousands of refugees . &quot;
&quot; in a trial period this week the authorities of Cal@@ ais , that the state should be authorised to sell 72 pro@@ vision@@ ing shops , selling hair@@ dressing services or tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or easy meals for a few Euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture , argued that these places should be crus@@ hed out , because they would be a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and san@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups divided the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state supported by state and other groups are not enough food for growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a tribunal in L@@ ille decided that there were no legal basis for the instruction of people who run the 72 pro@@ vision@@ ing business , but spati@@ ally believe that the concerns of Cal@@ ais are absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just nour@@ ish people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas will offer tranquil gathering between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the Netherlands was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; cafe of the camp , which is hosted and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum of asylum for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0.000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; cafe . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closure &quot; for these children of a catastrophe would be the youngest eight years old . &quot;
&quot; the two aid agencies Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge of the Migr@@ ants held on Friday that the number of people rose to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arrivals over the course of summer . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany Ras@@ a must adapt to the next generation of speed measurements : in various federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , the tempo of which should effectively survive the tempo . &quot;
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler from the Company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at random points where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
&quot; for example , on motorway construction sites or to cable bridges with temporary tempo , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limit . &quot;
a long @-@ lasting mobile construction can be too dangerous or consuming .
&quot; the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery holds five days , the case data is encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all cars can also be recorded at the same time via multiple tracks . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limit , as well as transit message to time , lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in a high @-@ run state , one can move the p@@ endant according to the manufacturer by car with p@@ pling cl@@ utch . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not just stolen , it is reduced in measuring operation so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way disappear disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built alarm system is to protect the car@@ ver from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to the sources of Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used . &quot;
&quot; in addition , foreign authorities also supports ban@@ quets with the new technology : recently , France has found 100 pieces of Georgian , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
great Britain takes place silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after taking Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance of Britain at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came in the finale on Thursday evening at a ab@@ rupt stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were be@@ aten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ posit stage here .
&quot; Fi@@ ji distributed a master class in handling , side @-@ Step@@ ping , post @-@ back , line @-@ cycle , and ro@@ her power to win gold - its first olymp@@ ic wa@@ ist of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was caused by the non @-@ poor tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Great Britain in that day - and they were able to be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they smote New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the distinct defeat of the bo@@ k , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could be back on them in the finals . &quot;
but irrespective of that Fi@@ ji would have be@@ aten a 15 @-@ man team in existence in the form of a 15 @-@ man team .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck . Fi@@ j@@ is chief trainer Ben Ryan , the former head of England from Wimbledon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
she lost eight years ago in Ryan &apos;s games at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
&quot; this work@@ book is going to do , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and left the attacks GB@@ s from fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell , and Co . on , when one would run into driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as the O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with even four minutes of playing , Jerry Tu@@ wai still added another attack from the right corner that he changed . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly has the ball arrested .
a h@@ itting T@@ ackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain by man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third gate ; but it has only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner to get a touch@@ down and there stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ets through further weak t@@ amp@@ ings of the UK teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the pause .
&quot; it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while the GB was still growing . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB led to basic changes in half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap ... for whole four minutes , which was fine for the circumstances of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua t@@ is@@ ova ran after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started a trial for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran for a long time in favor of the South @-@ se@@ sul@@ an@@ ist whose fans s@@ add@@ les , flags and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not hard to admire the playful approach to Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the p@@ fi@@ ff stri@@ des , the fi@@ j@@ is re@@ impover@@ ished and GB ki@@ cked crus@@ hed in the la@@ wns . &quot;
&quot; earlier in the day Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain forced South Africa in a scarce semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - British transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the bo@@ k in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton passed the line with an impressive foot@@ work and achieved a gate under the post in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant Tac@@ x by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer for ro@@ cker
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ aler@@ es gold than with these games and that wants to be called .
&quot; from the first stroke back to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve who enter the story , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in its golden moment at the Est@@ acio since Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though it was only those who were sitting at the Ru@@ des , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all@@ present when she joined the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in two without tax wife in succession , the first women in the history of British sports that put on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their dominance was absolute , at least their 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ wel@@ ded use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins , which gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which is not the nature of the Tri@@ om@@ p@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in the rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on to wil@@ dering hel@@ pers , which make the difference and it was no one more than the trainer , who would survive this day at all , than was diagnosed with him cancer . &quot;
he said he was risky .
&quot; I had bl@@ ister cancer , who is co@@ oper@@ able and that they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do it , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been quite a terrible situation .
it changes a bit the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck that he was at the beginning of 2014 , out of the season , could start what the interruption had to be kept on a minimum , in case that under such circumstances is the correct term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it starts .
&quot; rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the in@@ toler@@ ability of the victory they went their first thoughts of Williams , who spent a ner@@ ven@@ ing morning with a little bit more than anything else and tried to process its own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , who was the captain in the Royal arti@@ ll@@ ery reg@@ iment in an application in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s maybe something extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it is repeated only how much what this means , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one ; therefore , a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach of the world . &quot;
I could not have wished for a better person to wear or would like to have a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race in the past five years .
&quot; the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents were not able to keep up . &quot;
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had much in reserve . &quot;
we were very trapped at the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the trial . &quot;
it is really important to not take it away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not able to make some Tol@@ les .
&quot; we did not want a fire@@ works , we just wanted to get a good result and win the race what we did . &quot;
the pair will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV adv@@ ent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that that was my last race .
this would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London it took about six months to conceive , that I am an Olympi@@ as . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; it feels so much better , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years in exemplary for clarity
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ing@@ group &quot; , &quot; R@@ up@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , is reti@@ ring . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; Bav@@ arian &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a small fr@@ y drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for large water producers .
so it was some time ago in the original article in a post of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
a little later the water forum of the government of In@@ fran@@ ken announced the two @-@ association .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ing@@ group &quot; Bav@@ arian far as exemplary .
&quot; behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who was 31 years in the two @-@ association employees , including 28 years as Managing Director . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 65 , he was reti@@ re at the age of 65 . &quot;
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ing@@ group based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes annually approximately 150@@ ,000 cu@@ bic metres of water and supplies 32 places and hamlet with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member municipalities are the churches Pap@@ es , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Baun@@ ach . &quot;
for further towns and villages there are water supply agreements .
&quot; the current chair , latitude &apos; mayor in Ger@@ tru@@ de Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler 1985 was appointed as a water @-@ wart and was appointed as Managing Director of the Pur@@ ch@@ association . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from the water management and maintenance operations , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency sets on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; outstanding events she called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , the property sales in the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of a central computer control ( 1999 ) , and the bat@@ ching of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there have been no stagnation and you always have added any changes , because water lives and drinking water the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o she praised Go@@ als faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years away . &quot;
he used herself with a lot of heart blood for its water purpose and he has been living under water @-@ purpose as if it were his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , he had to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ing@@ group at the nit@@ rate level in front of the water@@ forum of the district submission . &quot;
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler s@@ on the one hand praised Wasser@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons Greek , who worked together with him 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water @-@ sk@@ e@@ eper and he was a loyal cap .
together we were an unbeatable team .
&quot; as the highlights from his point of view , he called the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the restructuring of the purpose . &quot;
but the biggest challenge and the most difficult operation was the pi@@ cks of the high @-@ pot at church lou@@ der on a 3rd January .
&quot; here , minus 17 degrees had to work throughout the night , so that the loc@@ alities could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; also the supply of Neu@@ brunn , one can only be maintained , because you filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the management of drinking water purpose was handed over to Daniel falls from Lau@@ ter , who joins the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler . &quot;
the sop@@ rano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko is openly talking with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; you have to have the courage to talk about it .
&quot; the medicine has made great progress , &quot; &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Corri@@ ere della Ser@@ a . &quot;
&quot; when the disease has been recognized by her son , she believed that she must die . &quot;
&quot; but the now eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago was well ahead , and will now be privately in New York , where the best therap@@ ists give . &quot;
&quot; to give an example : if I ask him something for two years , when I sang at the mailbox , he recalls nothing , &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot;

&quot; the victim was year 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator 1981 . &quot;
&quot; the responsible police in Lü@@ beck , first of all , did not want to make any information on the Ta@@ ther@@ ing or the relationship between perpetrators and victims ; but confirmed that a man was killed . &quot;

steel - light overview for German steel industry
the anti @-@ oxid@@ ated and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in meg@@ acities .
&quot; financial stresses that threaten the sector from the oil production , are from the table . &quot;
&quot; it abi@@ des for exemp@@ tion from the Renewable Energy Effici@@ ency in the field of production for self @-@ energy production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister of Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Fri@@ ag@@ erial ) . &quot;
I &apos;m really glad that we were able to finally reach the negotiations after two years .
&quot; therefore , the European Commission was initially planned to ask the steel manufacturer to ask the gases from the ho@@ fen to generate electricity for its own consumption , for the cas@@ hier . &quot;
the steel industry has an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry sector .
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a base certificate with the EU Commission after talks with competitive commission@@ er Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators in the steel works will be replaced , in case of an EEG @-@ setting of 20 percent . &quot;
but also this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall greeted the agreement of Germany with the European Commission for de@@ hydr@@ ation production .
&quot; thus , the status quo of the previous regulation will be widely determined . &quot;
special importance have the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; steel , future &quot; is a first step . &quot;
&quot; further need to follow . &quot;
&quot; considering the reform of the emissions law , climate and employment targets are also considering &quot; &quot; IG Metall facilit@@ ators Jörg Hof@@ mann , in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and substantial price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
&quot; in the past year , the situation was more exac@@ erb@@ ated than the world &apos;s largest increase in China in the face of the weak@@ ening domestic demand mass steel on the world market . &quot;
European manufacturer throw Chinese steel con@@ fes@@ sions pricing dumping .
in the course of this spring the situation has a little relaxed .
&quot; for a one hand cat@@ ered import duties on import steel effect , on the other hand the economic prospects have risen in China . &quot;
&quot; unclear , how sustainable the price of price is re@@ conditioning . &quot;
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p remained carefully on Thursday .
&quot; finally , the prices would have been more stag@@ nat@@ ed again . &quot;
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p also wanted to close the closing of individual works .
&quot; in the German steel industry , at the end of 2015 approximately 8@@ 6,000 people were employed . &quot;
&quot; in July , German steel producers remain cautious despite increasing prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tons of good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the economic association of steel produced on Friday . &quot;
after a short increase in May the crowd went back to each other next month .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increasing output . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : sing seniors well &quot;
&quot; the singing has accompanied UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp already her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the teacher training she defeated the F@@ ach of music , and now the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in an seniors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing me - emotional and physically , &quot; &quot; describes them . &quot;
&quot; after a sample she feels balanced , cheerful and overall living , she says . &quot;
&quot; by doing so , she does something good for her health and her mind . &quot;
&quot; S@@ ingen is equal to several perspectives , a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior League . &quot;
&quot; most seniors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; due to regular meetings , seniors can build and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; they often solve social and family structures in the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
this experience also made UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp in her choir : to address and organize themselves on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together .
singing can be ti@@ ring in a positive sense means H@@ ac@@ kler .
&quot; in doing so , seniors exercise a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
&quot; whoever calls for his lungs regularly , also in everyday life not as fast from the Pu@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; even if it comes to obtaining the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , S@@ ingen is often a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Association of Sen@@ iors @-@ organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the common singing had a much higher significance , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often observed that singing or hearing of songs in older people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; through Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te and particularly chanted tunes , the sick people deny itself in long rec@@ alled events . &quot;
&quot; while singing , the head is also required to have a special achievement , &quot; L@@ enz explains . &quot;
at the same time concentrate on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
&quot; elderly people who live alone , exercise alone , do not only concentrate on themselves . &quot;
another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through the singing in the choir means H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows through the singing in the choir .
&quot; to show yourself , if I am long for something , I will be better and vigil@@ ant about me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with the singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he says to have little talent , betra@@ ys l@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sings only - at 50 sin@@ ful people , who h@@ ears it , when a note goes to it ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the suitable offer , seniors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; sings someone from the acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior ench@@ y@@ ma , one can simply connect . &quot;
many cities also offer views of the choirs in the area .
who wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church .
many seniors can be found on the Internet .
&quot; if you do not have access to the internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with the Internet site . &quot;
&quot; who desire to sing should definitely join in a choir , s@@ lan@@ t H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing is doing a soul well and has a bit of liber@@ ating - this applies to all ages .
cats react sensi@@ bler than cr@@ ater on scre@@ ams of the young @-@ animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hannover what the effect of kittens has grown to adult animals .
&quot; to their surprise , the Mi@@ ght did not let the males go cold - but the difference ended up with the females always the same . &quot;
female cats may recognize the arousal level of kittens at the mi@@ cks of the little ones .
&quot; they respond to ten percent faster on foli@@ age of kittens , who choose to be found in great distress , like scientists from the veterinary University and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ater also react to the rod of kittens , but always the same . &quot;
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the mixing of less and strongly aroused young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; said Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; she is first authorized by the study , which was published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already figured out that the duration and sound of the kittens with the urgency of their help is different . &quot;
&quot; in total , nine adult males and eight females have been observed from the animal management of the MH@@ H . &quot;
they were introduced to a rod of little ones who were taken for three minutes from the throw @-@ box and separated from mother and si@@ blings .
&quot; to the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger kittens , which were additionally lifted up . &quot;
the researchers keep their results in spite of the slight sampling .
&quot; all females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , reacted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Con@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned out to be faster to the speaker if this rep@@ lica of the very aroused kit@@ ten .
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop with the sex mature .
&quot; one surprise was that the males have responded at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men to baby @-@ noises in the past . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women were sensitive to infants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey an arrest warrant has been issued against the one @-@ day soccer star of Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup , Turkey takes place again an important football game . &quot;
in front of the Du@@ el of the Erz@@ riv@@ ets Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clearly : &quot; business as &quot; is said .
&quot; even during the im@@ position of the exceptional state after the crash of the crash , the government , the everyday life of standard brus@@ hes should not be affected . &quot;
&quot; this , however , does not apply to those who are suspected of the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup . &quot;
the case of football will not be made available before the football case .
against the previous Star@@ ki@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ l@@ r introduced the pro@@ secutor &apos;s office a warrant .
&quot; according to this , the boom in America is now living in America , a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
South rice is to be p@@ endant of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is held responsible for the coup President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; although the exception for 90 days is still valid till October , in fact this has been on the lives of most Turks but as good as no effects . &quot;
&quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; in public places across the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split in p@@ endant and opponent &apos;s Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; particularly fans of the &quot; &quot; club &quot; &quot; were traditionally not among the friends of the President . &quot;
&quot; but what the Gro@@ s of the Turks , however , faced a dramatic experience in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans usually agree - no matter if their hearts strikes for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or col@@ lage .
at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala &quot; it will be back on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski again .
&quot; his sporty value presented the Köl@@ ner in the exp@@ ired season : with 17 gates , and nine templates in all cont@@ ests , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first time as a top@@ as of his association . &quot;
in the end@@ game against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he scored 1 : 0 @-@ seals .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy for his team .
thanks &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the dis@@ appoint season found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion .
&quot; according to the round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League the &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; also occur in the Europe League early . &quot;
in the southern via Li@@ g it only reached rank six .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; this is what we managed and this is the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master Bo@@ kt@@ as the game was better .
&quot; above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 Se@@ ason figures as Southern @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ar@@ kö@@ nig , presented the basis for the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; in this case , the alleged Gom@@ ez agreed under the contract and were not to return to Ar@@ kt@@ as for the coup only , because of the political situation in the country after his European Parliament . &quot;
&quot; if Mario yet wants to come to us , he only has to say it , &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; club @-@ chief Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , the storms would have to be ready to refrain from around one third of his to 7.5 million euros estimated vin@@ ess@@ al@@ är@@ s , Or@@ man is clear : &quot; his salary in Florence can not pay . &quot;
&quot; despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have medals to compete in Rio &quot;
the 34 @-@ year J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa must not start in Rio .
other over@@ led athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they are fighting in Rio by medals .
&quot; however , the topic of dop@@ ing determines the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
&quot; the Russian swi@@ mmer@@ ing in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ o@@ wa , who had compl@@ ained after a dop@@ ing lock , just before playing the playing ( 100 meters chest ) , was wi@@ ped out and bu@@ sted at its start ( 100 meters chest ) . &quot;
it provided a sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le scenery : with a set smile she was still proud into the hall and had prov@@ oked with her performance .
&quot; when fixed , that they will not bring gold , the audience broke into a j@@ ubil@@ ate storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are many more sports@@ men who , despite the dop@@ ing past , at the Olympic Games in Rio to start . &quot;
here an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was already locked two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since his spell the Olympi@@ ans from 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , it is number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds , and is regarded as the greatest challenging of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympi@@ as and seven @-@ fold World Cup in 2010 had to sit a six month lock in 2010 after taking the intake of the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery had had a strong dental pain , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended themselves . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : 2011 the Olympi@@ asi@@ fication of 2012 , World Championship in 2013 and European Championships from 2010 to 2016 has been positive on the prohi@@ biting stimul@@ ant funds meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine . &quot;
Per@@ kovic had the kno@@ w@@ ful intake and was closed for six months .
the four widest thro@@ ws this year will go to the account of the big Gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ pe ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , 2010 was positive tested and 21 months have been blocked . &quot;
&quot; a means of penis enlargement was responsible , praying Mer@@ ro@@ de . &quot;
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the so far fastest man in the world .
&quot; I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athletes have been removed so many medals . &quot;
&quot; thus , Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his world championship title of 2005 nine years later , after with him testosterone D@@ oping was established . &quot;
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympics @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abnorm@@ alities .
&quot; he also recognized bronze medals for the Olympic Games in 2008 , due to a certificate of the International Sports Tribunal for S@@ CA@@ S . &quot;
with 80@@ ,@@ 04 m it is situated in the rank two of the world list .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world empire and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was tested only in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year old World Championship clu@@ es referring to the intake of a forbidden dietary supplement , the Sper@@ re of the World @-@ Anti @-@ dop@@ ing Agency W@@ ada fell off and ran already on July 13th . &quot;
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian @-@ Sah@@ aran
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stands with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the State Department , Thomas L@@ ö@@ ll , Fri@@ ag@@ early . &quot;
&quot; she has suffered f@@ aded and was treated in the hospital , but I already left it again . &quot;
she has planned her home trip for early September .
&quot; whether the other explo@@ sions on the holidays of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ on are also affected by Austrian citizens , are still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the State Department says in close contact with local authorities , so schn@@ au@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were first explo@@ ded on Thursday night in a stop@@ over of two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to police , a Tha@@ il@@ ar were killed and about 20 people were injured , including Austrian people , three Germans , three low countries and three Italians . &quot;
&quot; Friday early then two explo@@ des went high again , and according to the authorities there was another man killed . &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket was reported in the morning a bomb attack .
in the det@@ ector near the popular beach Pat@@ ong is injured by police force a taxi driver .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb that had been killed . &quot;
the spr@@ ite was gone into the air according to the authorities in a flower strip in front of the territory of the coast .
&quot; finally , Det@@ on@@ ations were requested in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ om@@ on on the southeast coast , several injured . &quot;
&quot; one go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it meant . &quot;
&quot; the Bom@@ ben@@ att@@ achments carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said Army @-@ Major Dan@@ ai by meth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ ag@@ early in front of journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to speak to possible motives , but probably it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot;
&quot; Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks , which is typical for the bom@@ b@@ att@@ ate muscle separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; however , the Thai police declared , the attacks were not in relation to the Islam@@ ist movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said an speaker in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , it is clear that the bombs of opponents were placed by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; in recent days the authorities have received secrecy about im@@ pending attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
it is still unclear which group behind the attacks .
&quot; the police showed its officials across the country to increase security around important government buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and amuse@@ ment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bombar@@ d@@ ants , but mostly they are not directed against tourists . &quot;
&quot; in Hu@@ a H@@ ein lies a palace , which was used over the years of Tha@@ il@@ ands king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j . &quot;
&quot; according to the nun@@ ner@@ ed bombs , the Austrian State Department recommends to do a consequence to his homepage , the instructions of the Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high safety risk ( safety level 3 ) paid for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ al and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; according to disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , there are no necessary travel to these provinces . &quot;
increased security risks ( safety level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were taken a few days after a controversial referendum held by the military jun@@ ta .
this spatial military influence also has an impact in the years to come .
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said , the bombs should have been an attempt to sti@@ ff chaos while moving the country towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military jun@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody civil distur@@ ban@@ ces , holding itself in good to have the kingdom again to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not have been able to handle the military rebels in the extreme south of the country in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
a year ago in Bangkok in a case in Bangkok was killed by a popular Hin@@ du @-@ Sch@@ er in 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the recent history of the country .
the &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; is taken into Visi@@ ons of the Federal Constitutional Court for Constitutional protection . &quot;
&quot; according to several nation@@ als , the constitu@@ tion@@ ers in the federal government have provided the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see in the &apos; identity movement &apos; references for aspirations against the free democratic principles , &quot; said constitutional Protection Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , the im@@ migrant Islamic faith or from the Middle East become bl@@ amed in extrem@@ ist way . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we observe the movement too . &quot;
the &quot; identity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
&quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; mul@@ ticultural &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; loss of its own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional Prot@@ ect in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; &quot; identification &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority was closely coordinated with the state of the state . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; generally , extremis@@ ts to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ iger music . &quot;
&quot; ties , as well as right @-@ wing extremism . &quot;
this is not acceptable advertising for your own cause .
propaganda should address people emotion@@ ally .
young people are in a special way suscep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
&quot; at last , there were reports on contacts of the &quot; identification &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type can only be relevant to a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the particular party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals , the extrem@@ ist , changes their target , and so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; so , whether such persons are controlling their control over the party . &quot;
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view of the significant increase of ri@@ ghtful criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers , and refugee income , Ma@@ ate , he would not even talk about new rights in this context . &quot;
but we have established in recent years that there can be ri@@ ster@@ r@@ or@@ istic structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the free group .
&quot; it may well be that further ri@@ ster@@ r@@ or@@ istic groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee camps , or attacks from other extreme right @-@ wing motives . &quot;
but a clear or pan @-@ wide control of legal hor@@ ism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; did Ma@@ ate concerned about that many over@@ came to the account of men went , which had not appeared before in the right scene . &quot;
this is worrying .
&quot; many of the Tat@@ ar@@ rests with attacks on asylum arrivals were not known as criminal , politically motivated or p@@ endant of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed crimes that had previously agreed with right @-@ wing wing , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , however , who then took a far right through right @-@ wing m@@ oods . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it

this shows the courageous appearance of RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am of slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia , so slowly that it was no longer visible in the TV @-@ pictures . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was chosen .
in social networks Hab@@ te subsequently became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a return of 48 seconds to his outlet and won the 5@@ 9th rank of 59 . &quot;
but it was rather his not just a sporty figure who attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old is participating in the Olympic Games ?
Ethiop@@ ian got a special interest in the international swimming association .
this will be distributed to make swimming in under@@ rated countries more well @-@ known .
&quot; as in ae@@ dic@@ s most sports@@ men run , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the great race .
fast the first top names made the lap .
some media reported it as &quot; RO@@ BE@@ L of W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; drawing on a &quot; &quot; Well @-@ wearing &quot; &quot; the English Bou@@ lev@@ ard@@ stick &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; made it funny with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od . &quot; &quot;
&quot; his time , he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter of Fre@@ isti@@ l , since no part played . &quot;
comparisons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; with the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i for media attention . &quot;
unforgettable was the performance of the driver from Equ@@ atorial Guinea @-@ Guinea when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run about 100 meter Fre@@ isti@@ l .
fr@@ en@@ e@@ tic was fired at the time M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned eight months before Olympics and never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not look so closely
the Republi@@ can Presidential candidate of Donald Tr@@ ump talks on an election event in Florida .
&quot; if the election to the US President , Donald Tr@@ ump has already become an aging video . &quot;
he then went to the holiday .
&quot; when Donald Tr@@ ump loses the U.S. presidential elections in November , it would be either cl@@ ed , or I have a very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of Re@@ public@@ ans in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich for him at the end of the political correctness , be it in order , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he called the US President Barack Obama and the nom@@ inee of Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia of the Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within its party , more and more resistance are formed . &quot;

the interest of other firms on the vehicle is obviously big .
the Post is planning to sell its electric vehicle rout@@ ing sco@@ oter .
&quot; shortly , the Group wants to launch trade with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
the mail wants to offer their electric transport from the coming year as well as the free automobile .
&quot; we want to get into the sale of third parties , &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the company has been checking for months since months , whether it will be delivered to its own Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with the letters and bag , to sell other farms too . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ board Jürgen Ger@@ des had said , there are always again requests , e.g. by craftsmen . &quot;

&quot; in post @-@ own production , the company is planning to build up to 10,000 cars a year and layer . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ des had announced the Group to increase its fleet of electric vehicles significantly and in long @-@ term , a complete change to the environment @-@ friendly vehicles . &quot;
&quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he had said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we place the complete fleet .

G@@ FR@@ P Leadership enters after the resignation of G@@ FR@@ P
the consumer research company Gf@@ K sw@@ am his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
but the retreat suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the Gf@@ K market research was that the chair by Chief Matthias Hart@@ mann is all the more uncertain - the longer the successes we promised .
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after once again dis@@ continued business numbers and the resignation of the company leadership is the worldwide number five of the industry in front of a personalized new start .
G@@ FR@@ P leader wants to leave the company by the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board of Arno Mahl@@ ites already with effect on 12 September from the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the leadership in the board should already take over the previous Board of Gerhard Haus@@ jer@@ inger for the 1st September , divided the company . &quot;
&quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; super@@ visor &quot; &quot; until a successor to Hart@@ mann . &quot;

details did not want to call on a Friday on Friday .
&quot; who will in future become the market research company , be still unclear . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , it was on Friday , at the shareholders , the disappointment was last great for the continued success of years ahead of years ago . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K tip since 2011 .
&quot; but the fruits of the restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business , every shareholder will eventually be rest@@ less . &quot;
&quot; if that would be in the case of BMW , that would also make the quot@@ as such , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; after set@@ backs in the previous quarter , the company could not stop loss of loss in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; with 36@@ 1,2 million euros , sales rose by 6.@@ 1 percent below the level of the comparable figure in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in the first half of the year , revenues generated with 7@@ 21,@@ 2 million euros by 3.4 per cent . &quot;
&quot; in the second quarter , the value of the company is deb@@ ited in the face of its difficult economic situation . &quot;
&quot; the Consumer Experience was necessary for the Group &apos;s value of EUR 139 million to the Group , under the St@@ ay a loss of € 14@@ 8.@@ 2 million . &quot;

&quot; after a man@@ s@@ lu@@ ous calculation , the se@@ wage rate in Az@@ endorf then lie at 4.@@ 37 euros per cu@@ bic meter . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was observed in the approval of the budget by the estate department , that for these se@@ wage systems . &quot;
&quot; due to legal foundations , Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the equipment free of charge . &quot;
&quot; as of 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from World Heritage , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg have to grip deeper into the po@@ cket@@ book . &quot;
the bones are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt showed the Panel , was necessary for the se@@ wage plant of the market for wast@@ e@@ water systems . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , Over@@ - and sub@@ folders from the previous calendar period are to be exp@@ elled . &quot;
&quot; the engra@@ ving gi@@ ver increases , Schmidt therefore that it is equipped with all three se@@ wage systems for relatively small facilities with a very low se@@ wage waste , which lie between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; due to the small distribution basis for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros could have been engra@@ ved . &quot;
waste water in all three systems is slightly declined .
&quot; furthermore , the calculation period in all three systems were not least due to its age of san@@ itation and repair applications in a considerable extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf was almost 30 years old , the facilities for World Heritage , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt desp@@ ised that in the se@@ wage system Az@@ endorf had to be exchanged on the basis of any damage .
&quot; in the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ins , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led by reason and in the pond installation . Lop@@ p had to be built after nearly 20 years of operation of the first class pond , the Kl@@ är@@ schl@@ ch provides to keep the water @-@ legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the advanced super@@ visor and maintenance costs came to be taken into account in accordance with the new calendar period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 still considerably below the current level . &quot;
stone houses made clear that at the low se@@ wage case in the three systems the expenses for operation and maintenance are fully integrated .
&quot; over the past 20 years , N@@ added Schmidt , added the market of large entertainment costs in the past 20 years has been spar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the mentioned systems will continue to be prec@@ arious according to stone houses in the long run , since one could not extend the supply area of the water @-@ purpose Fri@@ esen@@ bach around these plants because it is concerned with deficit of deficit . &quot;
Bulgaria booked for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria stayed in July 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first to be booked over zero since October last year .
the annual average de@@ flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
&quot; the price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1,@@ 0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1,@@ 0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.@@ 2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 -@@ 0.@@ 2 % .
in July 2016 the following groups of consumer goods were observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.@@ 3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.@@ 3 % ) .
&quot; prices fell by clothing and shoes ( 2 % ) ; mo@@ bili@@ ar , household appliances and routine expectations ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,@@ 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the advance of alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; anim@@ e &quot; effect as asi@@ an caricature critic@@ ised
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is inspired by anim@@ e but some observers say that it is uns@@ ensi@@ tizing against breeds .
&quot; with his filter tool , sn@@ ap@@ chat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already has an absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or figure , which could be of a Roy Light@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ flo@@ wering , stub@@ born tools that produce more than 30 million improved sel@@ fs a day . &quot;
all mis@@ steps are transferred to the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past criticism in which they were accused that the app Black@@ surface conve@@ ying or white skin as beauty ideal .
&quot; when this week some users proposed a filter that gave them mud , wrong teeth and raised che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist caricature of A@@ sians - &quot; yel@@ lowing . &quot; &quot;
they asked if these repeti@@ tive controllers on a larger problem reported that the company has diversity .
&quot; the news and the rebellion were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports by The ver@@ ge and motherboard , one day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat , that it would have the feature disabled . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e @-@ characters and not as cartoon by Asi@@ atic .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders that did not experience se@@ is@@ atism , the filter reminded in@@ viol@@ ating se@@ is@@ che@@ es . &quot;
others refused to the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail I wrote Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean American art student , whose t@@ we@@ et over the photos were widely distributed that the filter &quot; hur@@ ting and mild were told unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the oppos@@ ites of a very conflic@@ ting Asian cartoon and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not a long @-@ proof , but that the yel@@ lowing was pulled to the extreme extreme . &quot;
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural hub .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless dialogue and integration of integration , from meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience young people - who are in the race di@@ vers@@ ed as their older opponents - could be more likely to expect their sen@@ sibility .
&quot; when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats felt an image created that for one user , it is much more difficult that such things were un@@ noticed than it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Zh@@ u said in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Zh@@ u , Zh@@ u decided to work as a product manager and engineering in the medium to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account , and to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes that r@@ ack@@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in adju@@ sting practices at Sn@@ ap@@ chat . &quot;
Zh@@ u critici@@ zed the big part white , only male leadership position and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese Zh@@ u @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they are safe or comfortable to say what to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the Sn@@ ap@@ chat largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat continued to discuss the cultural background of his employees , but according to a consultation , the company has recently set up a personnel responsible , which focuses on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Zh@@ u said that she will be closed her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not OK . &quot;
&quot; military management of ISIS Intelligence , presents the Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military @-@ related information of the United States Central Command began changing information to record an optimal picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it had allowed the actual states of Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of armed forces , intelligence and the Wehr@@ macht , reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analy@@ sts who reported how pre@@ dict@@ ate their assessments to the American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; news @-@ related information , which have typically been cro@@ wned by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Com@@ man@@ ders , marked regularly a positive image of American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual states on site and were consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; commented a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what has happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable to our soldiers if poor analysis presents our political leaders , &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can Member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
leadership in the Cent@@ Com range until the top tip of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed continuous problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of the Iraqi armed forces .
&quot; although there is no direct indication that government tips given under Obama instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts saw the pressure from their predec@@ essors , an optimal picture of the threat of the Islamic state , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 many Central Command Press Rel@@ eases , comments and statements made in front of Congress is clearly more positive than the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com also known that a military re@@ conquest Mos@@ sul@@ s can begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investig@@ ators , it is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can congresses from K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the tips of Central Command changed the after@@ math of economic reports to the risk of ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
the Re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force to live after they had played that analysts are worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be fully completed by detailed findings while the investigations will be continued .
additional investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the General Secretary General of the Defense Department .
democratic members of the news service committee published on Thursday their own findings that coinci@@ des with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of after@@ math about IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; gave the highest democr@@ at democr@@ at in the comm@@ enting of Adam B. ship , known in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , such as Mr. Shi@@ p , &quot; delayed the release of after@@ math reports , &quot; s@@ hab@@ by the morality among analysts and &quot; gave no less space for smo@@ other opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Shi@@ p and Democrats , who gave no evidence of an intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analysts with regard to a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by investig@@ ators via the General inspec@@ tor of the Pentagon , which were received after complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a spokes@@ person of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Defence Department would not comment on Congress while the investigation of the General Staff was still going on . &quot;
&quot; but he also gave that &quot; experts sometimes quite diver@@ ging opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defense . &quot;
&quot; the investig@@ ational effects on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an alleg@@ ation , which is now taken by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations last year have raised the question why President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest in@@ estim@@ ations of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds on constraints of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , faced with the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation of occupation in Iraq and had little time on it to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team at Mr. Hoo@@ ker presents a significant impact on the financial situation expressed by the Islamic State and had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these pro@@ vision@@ ing refin@@ eries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; this knowledge was not published , however , reported the Times in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ s commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legis@@ lature because of his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the USA win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with the UK . &quot;
&quot; one day after they shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American players won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
&quot; however , they know that the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition , and are equ@@ alled in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which after its 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
the United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first lap .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which of the two within their group from six teams will reach the first and second place . &quot;
the first place will take a little longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
&quot; as always the game may go on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising deal by their success story , four years after they landed at the last London games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
B@@ AM was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time in three years with a ho@@ ckey sleeping in hands ( their two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a national team of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , as it could not qualify for the Ka@@ der . &quot;
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team everything went wrong . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , a trainer of the National Team , and thus the things began to turn into better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work in London that we now have .
we have the ru@@ d@@ der completely s@@ nat@@ ch .
&quot; on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door@@ step in the first half of the game with a return from the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and kept the play of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took their hands into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she accomplished a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the center and swal@@ lowed the ball into the gate around the Americans to get a 2 @-@ 0 guide . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last district .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , which had previously had a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the end of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are consistent and in@@ escap@@ able , a quick season between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the olymp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself is a burning stom@@ a , which is passed from wr@@ ist@@ ening to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athle@@ te for the tri@@ athle@@ te . &quot;
&quot; you can not switch off the TV to read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue shop , without hearing over Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ is@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and a woman &apos;s warm with di@@ m@@ ples , could possibly have been sent under this known name which would be sent to Prime Time , provided by sponsors and well @-@ being @-@ TV advertising if he would be a swi@@ mmer , tur@@ ner or even fen@@ cer . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the olymp@@ ic trampoline for gold . &quot;
the olymp@@ ic flame not illuminated every event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not universally accepted : air@@ brush , ar@@ chery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast@@ swimming and may reign over for a long time .
&quot; but if I might make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet char@@ me of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline has been an Olympic Event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years it was so spar@@ sely noticed that many that I had asked , did not know that it is at all an Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the US has sent athletes to competition , there has never been a medal in the trampoline and had made a athletes until the end of 2012 . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Can@@ adi@@ ans to share the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ she Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend her gold medal from London this year .
&quot; jumping on the trampoline has some out@@ sider char@@ me , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ resolved ear for a clo@@ wn@@ school than that sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; in this place I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a born enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
it has hum@@ orous potential - the car@@ to@@ on@@ ous tre@@ mb@@ ling of its never @-@ end clouds - but also the Grazie of the turn@@ around and diving , the two sports that unites it essentially . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means so much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; asp@@ iring winner jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling moves ( turning , he@@ aders and sal@@ tos ) before they land at the feet . &quot;
&quot; they are evaluated according to the official Olympi@@ ad after execution , degree of difficulty and &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women are compete in Rio against each other . &quot;
the most common Olympic V@@ ector is straight .
&quot; med@@ all@@ ists must continue in their quest for gold faster , faster , upward and over , sometimes down to the finish , sometimes back and back , upwards and down to the playground . &quot;
&quot; they do not only hunt the ornam@@ ental or the cur@@ tail@@ wall , but also in the television transmission : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the targeted pursuit is pos@@ h , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator . &quot;
but it is also what I think even when looking at these games as something ti@@ ring .
&quot; of this , the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite . &quot;
the vector of the trampoline is above .
moving forward is not the goal .
&quot; he or she ins@@ ane , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effortlessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no h@@ ectic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is just as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the Streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; those of the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will show the ends as part of a medium @-@ bloc on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
&quot; in the middle of the Olympic Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in general turmoil . &quot;
&quot; if the raising awareness can only be achieved through the anxiety and the L@@ ti@@ fication of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal recently , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits his after air , new fan@@ base . &quot;
&quot; one generation prot@@ ested &quot; &quot; in Ethiopia , Long , an ally of the US &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia on violent resistance from the government .
witnesses say that seventy prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police when clas@@ hes were killed .
is Ethiopia just to break up ?
&quot; over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in the past few months , protests against the government fought the country and spread out more and more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response was un@@ mer@@ ciful to human rights organisations .
proclaimed that poli@@ c@@ emen were shot at tens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killed .
&quot; moving around the protests , which probably are from the last or beginning of this year , show like security professionals young people with st@@ aves , while they were forced to make a hand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Office for Human Rights now requires a thorough examination .
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror across the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded at the respectable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new com@@ mu@@ ters in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but an example for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country was limited , with dissi@@ dents effective for silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile , or sent into prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness . &quot;
but this could change .
&quot; if you sup@@ press people and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Ze@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous ail@@ ments that cover everything from the ground @-@ use to the stran@@ gle@@ hold with respect to the power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a far provisional election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the tensions rising along the border with Eritrea ; a battle for this timi@@ d , controversial line , called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts are afraid of the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den which in recent years have been more or less forced to benefit the turbul@@ ence and ar@@ ming themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of contrac@@ tion after years of prior to exec@@ utions under the surface explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , very many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate via social media , as cheap smartphones were more and more frequent and improved the internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government doesn &apos;t get access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially for protests , do many people still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies which conce@@ al where they are staying . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave that they gathered themselves so too protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia , mostly Christian floods , in politics and the economy , while they are exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and live in flat @-@ areas . &quot;
but even this is changing straight .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests found in areas of the Am@@ hara and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , in the secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the unrest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; he was seen as a tactical cooperative , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
&quot; analysts say that it was particularly mis@@ used to perceive early signs of dis@@ content and to use special officers , to handle opponents and make them in@@ harmful . &quot;
&quot; the present regime is lacking in this basic regime , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively un@@ seen reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of the north of Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am from the south . &quot;
analy@@ st say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security @-@ controlled safety services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time Ethiopia was experienced such a turmoil in 2005 , after thousands of elections were prot@@ ested , according to the figures of analy@@ st , were seemingly fu@@ elled by the government and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even if it were less than in the last months and these days of unrest were relatively fast over . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian Ethiop@@ ians leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new com@@ mu@@ ters , as well as for their measurable progress in poverty @-@ fighting poverty . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal abnorm@@ alities of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , protest in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ an city , from Tig@@ ray @-@ shops and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more experienced in social media . &quot;
analy@@ st said that protests the US and other Western allies bring in a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ ym about the neighbouring Somalia , even if it &apos;s recently raised that it has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West will clearly support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want his ally collap@@ sed in an already volati@@ le territory . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin gr@@ at@@ walk . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama founded ISIS &apos; sar@@ cas@@ m &apos; .
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to dissi@@ p@@ ate the last controversy , which surrounds his campaign by saying that his repeatedly repeated claim , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would be the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State , not seriously meant . &quot;
this clari@@ fying clari@@ fying new questions about the skills of the Presidential candidates of the Republi@@ can to whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandable to the American public .
&quot; it also brings his co @-@ members , who seek to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase in protecting , in the actual position , to explain statements , which he might not have meant . &quot;
&quot; after spending the hint at an election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump went back to the claim on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really did not intended to indicate the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was just a sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was opposite to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative radi@@ om@@ od@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to help weaken the statement slightly , he reminded him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him , the Republi@@ can presidential elections can &apos;t know anything about it . &quot;
the last storm of criticism sh@@ attered on Mr. Tr@@ ump while he tries to draw the focus of his campaign because of random transformations to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking to the economic situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this topic again .
&quot; to get through Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ ton proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
&quot; at the end of July he drew strong criticism of himself , when he said , the Russians should crack Mrs. Clin@@ ton E@@ mails , however he later stated &quot; Natural , &quot; I said the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back home .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of its methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans as they arrive , and then possibly &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe , he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has taken an additional tone , since its re@@ frac@@ tures have continued to go back . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a tour with great lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to apologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he frequently accused his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to understand his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while he is strengthened in the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ kes have brought his loyal co @-@ powers to stand in the un@@ comfortable situation regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may also be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the umps of prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , had great trouble to defend the candidates in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was asked to the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ umps , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in that sense that Barack Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ bone , completely wrong and so it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , served by the Mrs. Clinton as an external minister@@ ial , it ISIS allowed to spread out the situation in the Middle East corro@@ sive under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and cast them before to riding upon each of his words and be taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he under@@ mined the &quot; poor , dark@@ ly &quot; television experts , who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; You cannot do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked over Mr. Tr@@ umps as a further proof that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; once pushed across the market , café in Green@@ point returns &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a s@@ hab@@ by café in Williamsburg , where you could only pay cash , which no Wi @-@ Fi had , but for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ ka was pushed . &quot;
&quot; the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , the b in the summer of 2014 , sold soap in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous people as the last loss in a gent@@ ler city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ed wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is changing , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but when New York is changing , then it is also new . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north from its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accept credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ term staff of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafes . &quot;
he began working in 2001 at Ver@@ b and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when he offered a customer to provide money for a new out@@ post , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , gave many things . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu we are facing sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are Gar@@ ni@@ es such as cap@@ ers and su@@ cking oni@@ ons .
there are Natur@@ re@@ iss@@ ors .
&quot; the café does not serve beer , but there are fresh juice . &quot;
&quot; after nine months Rodri@@ guez , Rodri@@ guez said that he has noticed a st@@ alled stream of ancient tribal customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also pushed at the price of Williamsburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was a such a customer .
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Williamsburg , and visited the ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after having moved to Green@@ point , it would take the way . &quot;
&quot; after the b had closed , she gave a while the coffee @-@ ham , she told them . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that the coffee and the culture was in the ver@@ b that liked me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she has got coffee again , even if she ordered this day instead of her usual I@@ ced Coff@@ ee Tea , who is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long @-@ standing customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before work and ordered inevitably the same .
&quot; I moved to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch , and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients into the menu .
&quot; nowadays , Ros@@ enthal get still his usual order , but sometimes he switches his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said he won &apos;t have a Gro@@ ll that the soap @-@ shop has taken the old business space .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , offered a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go back to their offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish residents Green@@ points have also accepted the café too . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu to the Polish , and Rodri@@ guez said that he presi@@ ded to face them soon so that his new neighbours will feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has additional advantages .
an ör@@ n saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the cafe is expanded to a nearby building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is sufficient to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was Chief certificate and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the appearance of the Lok@@ et and the bri@@ ers felt a new coffee like a home@@ coming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; an abundant meal &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after its climb to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roo@@ sev@@ elt took his lunch in the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as the gour@@ mets , President Roo@@ sev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for elaborate delic@@ acy of Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ia gr@@ as and Maryland water turtles . &quot;
&quot; its menu on this day was somewhat modest : filled eggs in Tom@@ ato Sauce , potato p@@ ü@@ ree and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with young people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both grocery stores .
&quot; co@@ es last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; was told by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while pulling in her book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; about living in a residential house at the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their newest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in the Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity as they met with a re@@ porter at the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , bu@@ zz@@ led snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market . &quot;
&quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh k@@ äs@@ es@@ and@@ wich with olive @-@ piece , while co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with mas@@ hed potato and vegetable mixture . &quot;
&quot; when the re@@ porter ordered Hack@@ br@@ ate , this was suitable for discussion on food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there was Erd@@ nut bro@@ t , liver cheese and sav@@ ory bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little tri@@ ght that crosses the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as a dinner .
Co@@ e sm@@ ir@@ ks .
&quot; it has to be placed in the stomach like b@@ lei , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in recent years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , a All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women bo@@ iled for male field work , and it became freshly baked past@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; there were Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; a Square &quot; &quot; is characterized by the road that the country went with it , no longer the land of the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , tense theme , &quot; &quot; buried co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; just as tense was the new bud@@ get@@ ary : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and cas@@ ser@@ tions were too stap@@ le food , the casinos re@@ ass@@ uring as &quot; wonderful way , eating remains re@@ reliable , &quot; noted Zi@@ egel@@ man , because cooks were able to hide in@@ appe@@ al ingredients under a Cre@@ ed sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper drying processes .
&quot; meat , which was for years the focus of American food was a rare luxury . &quot;
especi@@ al mixtures have been tried out as a cal@@ orie and nutritious satisfaction take preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy kitchen .
&quot; during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , prepared Zi@@ egel@@ man a dish from this epoch , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular supplement on lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the farm recipes .
&quot; never before or since then , the household econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , leader of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 to 1943 - the eating habits of the country @-@ like . &quot;
&quot; publishing their recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; household policy &quot; &quot; and the challenge , pamp@@ er like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals to be met . &quot;
&quot; a Square Night &quot; is a celebration of historical delicacies .
&quot; especially tasty , the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmer kitchen in his kitchen , he is like the million@@ th serious man of the world to which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost con@@ gol@@ ded dining room and carried a smo@@ king .
he was deli@@ ght@@ fully realistic .
&quot; at the same time , President Roo@@ sev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to establish a stamp with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the recru@@ iting of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors carried out by Mrs Roo@@ sev@@ elt , that the White House created the boring food in Washington , but also one of the most depri@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , with food to deal was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as science has been applied to food . &quot;
the couple gave us better understood in writing the book &apos;s eating habits in mother - for example how they could not throw foods away .
&quot; she had a genuine fear of the wast@@ age of food , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man reminded themselves : &quot; &quot; she really made people ill . &quot;
there was the wind exploitation .
&quot; after the plates were ev@@ acu@@ ated at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they moved and Co@@ e a dessert that they had at home : the pl@@ um @-@ stick , the President Roo@@ sev@@ elt ate at noon . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a common trick , humble also to miss a name . &quot;
&quot; there was no curved cream , just pl@@ ums , little flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone got something reluc@@ t@@ antly to a spo@@ on into the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
surprisingly it didn &apos;t tasted bad .
Co@@ e took three times a post .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer , he said to his wife , &quot; A pair of ch@@ opped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
in bombs with bombs : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ki@@ cked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died at a vene@@ er attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group , who saved the life according to the Picture @-@ Newspaper . &quot;
&quot; 2@@ 900 volunteers have their own lives in the game , to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to help make first aid in the war . &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil war that shows him at a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a house , went in 2014 to the world . &quot;
it made the Syrians about the shining symbol@@ ism in the hor@@ rors of war .
&quot; but as heroes , he never seen himself , said loud image : &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die , save life , I think that God is in me a mar@@ ty@@ r . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Omar itself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
the Heli@@ kop@@ ter have rejected four vene@@ ers over the Alzheimer adia district which was filled with chlor@@ ine .
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we now remove the poison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb , so that no children are playing &quot; , &quot; the image c@@ ites his final words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ ist is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks usually occur only in winter to the surface .
this ha@@ i was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the S@@ anna &apos;s research vessel .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to the present day .
Greenland has only been born with 150 years of offspring .
&quot; leis@@ urely swi@@ ms the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is estimated at an average of just 1.@@ 220 meters . &quot;
&quot; only when it arrives , the five metre long animal acceler@@ ates at 2,@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Rob@@ be with this maximum speed . &quot;
but that of long@@ itu@@ dinal @-@ shaped lifestyle is to be a pat@@ chy for a high age .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the Copenhagen University and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from a Greenland who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; madness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ pper from the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demographic research in Rostock , this life @-@ span which means for vert@@ ebr@@ ates a world record . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist already assumed that Greenland become a stone @-@ old stone . &quot;
only lacking the evidence .
&quot; Greenland are difficult to watch , eventually they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the thin coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water @-@ temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive on the surface in winter only in winter . &quot;
&quot; on the lifestyle of Greenland , researchers know accordingly little . &quot;
&quot; their time pent@@ pent@@ ine measures it , when they had six animals with a transm@@ itter , and they had six animals with a transm@@ itter . &quot;
&quot; prey these Ha@@ ie still : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the rem@@ n@@ ants of a Rob@@ be , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
&quot; possibly they hunt sle@@ ep@@ y animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice @-@ sea , looking car@@ c@@ asses , which are from higher water layers to bottom . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now studied 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ y , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a stop@@ per from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ tim@@ etres long , while the largest 50@@ 2 centimeters is measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of animals , they analyzed with the carbon @-@ 14 method the lens of shar@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eyel@@ ash arises already before the birth of shar@@ ks , which are contained in it later no longer . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
&quot; their birth should therefore lie in the atmosphere after the early 1960s , as nuclear weapons trying to drag bigger amounts of this radio@@ active carbon dioxide into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in that with 220 centimeters of the third tier , the Lin@@ sen@@ kers dis@@ integrating a low excess of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all major Greenland @-@ ha@@ y had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts , which arises from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed a 4@@ 93 centimeters long Greenland for a 4@@ 93 centimeters long Greenland an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimeters is even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ females can only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers could assign the length to an age . &quot;
&quot; as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters is probably at the br@@ ink of sex @-@ ripe and his age with 156 years was determined , Greenland with the multip@@ lication obviously can be at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
also this should be for vert@@ ebr@@ ates at present around the world .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
&quot; also the previous record @-@ holder , a 211 year old Greenland @-@ wal , in whose bac@@ on the neck a 120 years old Har@@ po@@ unding was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there are often on as@@ parag@@ us . &quot;
so they mature later - and al@@ th@@ less slow .
&quot; to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly big . &quot;
&quot; the volume is growing much faster than its surface , through which the animal temper@@ ed heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram is therefore much larger than with a grams of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on getting as many descendants as possible , &quot; explains the evolution of evolution . &quot;
&quot; however , a very big animal should rather invest its resources in a long life . &quot;
building in a double pack
&quot; with topics around building construction , the community at the latest meeting has been focused on focus . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the panel picked up the communication of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally , the marketing of the recently proven apartment can begin . &quot;
&quot; the sale of property , parti@@ tions and availability issues have been clarified and the applications for measurement has been made , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; Stre@@ et@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ straße - Building section 1 ) is nothing more in the way . &quot;
the council is convinced that the construction is in the rural and peaceful residential community Schön@@ au young families and former seniors alike .
&quot; as it was called , he can report himself immediately in the city hall , on the allocation of the plots , the municipal council is expected to advise on its September session . &quot;
&quot; to include requests for the settlements of further business enterprises , united with the creation of jobs , to be able to come up , decided to re @-@ use the council , which was only newly created in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the range of sub @-@ time business there is already been proven industrial cov@@ eted by two par@@ c@@ els in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from the Bre@@ xit
&quot; according to the competition in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg City , the city has the best opportunities to reloc@@ ated jobs and companies in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt am most of the Bre@@ xit V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ ni@@ s , Head of Excellence , financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; following the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether it is to continue to operate in London from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called EU @-@ pass , the approval must be approved in the UK until now . &quot;
this is just big US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
the lob@@ by@@ ists &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; anticip@@ ates 10000 new jobs on the main five years .
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , I am the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , united responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the euro zone , as well as further important authorities such as European insurance coverage E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is less significant in the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the staff is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg , a large fund industry , but also like Dublin in the infrastructure worse . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach in Frankfurt thanks to the big airport .
&quot; furthermore , the city with easy access properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Seine , the rent for class properties is by 50 percent higher than am Main . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the company consulting Mer@@ cer stands the city on No. 7 , Luxembourg to No.@@ 19 , Dublin , No. 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London is still going to remain the most important financial center in Europe despite the Bre@@ xit vote .
&quot; for this also the correlation of forces : in London , the figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking sector , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
an US office decided that Gilead sciences are entitled to the refund of the right @-@ costs that you have ar@@ isen from the Hep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmac@@ ist Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June Gilead was freed from a claim payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were freed in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medications So@@ val@@ di and Harv@@ oni of Gilead , after a US judge a pattern of mis@@ behavior by Mer@@ ck , including the opinion and other in@@ eth@@ ic acts . &quot;
&quot; a complaint against the complaint against the complaint against the complaint , in Beth @-@ minister@@ ial Fre@@ eman , that Gilead is entitled to receive the cost which came into place during the defense of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck tries to compens@@ ate with Gilead , who dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients suffering with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 as Gilead and Mer@@ ck meet each other def@@ endants and are entitled to laboratory work , including Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the medication of Gilead . &quot;
they supported troops by the USA that they have reg@@ ained full control of Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; supported by the USA , troops supported the full control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left these , said an speaker of the group on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , after the excerpt of the remaining group of fighters that have buried within the city , currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they have released over 2,000 civilians who were held by the fighters as ho@@ stages , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council Re@@ uters . &quot;

&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton released their tax statement on Friday for 2015 , which revealed a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and her husband , a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective tax rate of 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clin@@ ton USD 1 Million paid for charitable purposes mainly to the Clinton Foundation , the former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5,@@ 3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ aren ; former Secretary of Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million by the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book about their term in the State Department . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ ton Candi@@ date for the Vice President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , his tax explic@@ ations of the last ten years . &quot;
they paid an effective tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ ton Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ hel@@ per Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri was well known in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; in a cr@@ ush contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hidden behind wrong exc@@ uses and extrac@@ tors in terms of his previous promises to publish its tax . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidate to publish their tax explic@@ ations , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot;
&quot; tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a reason for his denial of tax examination by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ &apos;s election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ umps special advis@@ ors , to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish anything before the tax inspections are not completed . &quot;
&quot; in other words , Tr@@ umps critics , among other things , also the Republi@@ can presidential elections of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already noted that his ref@@ usal issues relating to assets , his donations for charitable organisations , his business geb@@ ars and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has already thrown himself on the subject , and published a video on the Internet in the high @-@ level Re@@ public@@ ans Tr@@ ump call for its tax policy . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , she talked about the subject during a speech to the economy of Michigan . &quot;
he ref@@ uses to do that which has done every other Presidential candidate in recent decades and publish its tax arguments . &quot; she said to the crowd .
&quot; Poli@@ tico has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and an economic journalist of the New York Times awarded a series of tax fraud and tax advice on Friday that this might still be the case . &quot;
federal taxes have become a subject in the election campaign .
&quot; Clinton supports a settlement which is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ quet , which would ensure that people earn more than USD 1 million to pay a tax rate of at least 30 % . &quot;
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka requested buff@@ quet , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ et@@ gl@@ omer@@ ate here has its headquarters to exchange Tr@@ ump into a meeting to exchange their tax . &quot;
Buff@@ et said he was also a tax test of IR@@ S and tr@@ ump have &quot; fear &quot; before the voters and not before the tax authorities .
Clin@@ ton Camp@@ a@@ ign has declined fiscal policy until the year 2007 .
&quot; Clin@@ ics , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective post @-@ tax rate of approximately 32 % between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax policy statement by 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of their income as a salary referred to , unlike most of all Americans . &quot;
&quot; its main money situation was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ ton dividends and income revenues of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 con@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; natural Prot@@ ect in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from it , in which people inhabited settlements too - they throw condoms on them , who are filled with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der . &quot;
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had already taken years ago with the idea of being trained by volunteers in the north of Tanzania , a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their houses and harvest without sacrific@@ ing animals . &quot;
previously many sp@@ ers have used to defend themselves .
&quot; Friday is a leader , dedicated to animal welfare . &quot;
&quot; since we have developed the ...

Jewish film@@ maker defeats Berliner Hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix for &quot; Arab &quot; call was removed - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots en@@ gros@@ sed a media call , after he had betrayed that the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli election , since the Arab guests were calling for an employee . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; had his anger in the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , having an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lan@@ z@@ mann was trying to find Israel on the site list of the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer that he received there , &quot; sho@@ ok him , &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel asked that the measure was a &quot; inten@@ tional decision of the management of the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel . &quot;
&quot; the reason behind it , del@@ etes in the director even more anger . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs , and they demanded that the election will be deleted , the employee of Lan@@ z@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ merchant called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the southern German newspaper . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied by this event and upset .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this has worn in exactly this hotel chain in Germany is even greater shame .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
the incident prov@@ oked a pretty big resonance on the internet when people called the whole scandal .
&quot; some under@@ signed the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel , that it would have given the alleged &quot; &quot; Arab guests &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; ashamed of you , &quot; &quot; was it in another post in which it indicated that the hotel , which is located at the pos@@ h Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly proved all accus@@ ations of themselves and called the incident , &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; apologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports The mirror . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel did not include a direct statement , &quot; said the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung an speaker of the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel . &quot;
it adds that the di@@ alling code was now added .
police pres@@ upp@@ ose Tr@@ as@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mi@@ s@@ osse against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; students were arrested on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo to the police , when they gathered together to demonstrate the reforms of the government for the public education system . &quot;
the police put a trou@@ gh and rubber bul@@ lets against the prot@@ esters .
&quot; the difficulties began , as police officers were trying to dis@@ integrate the students , which led to the police of rubber and comfor@@ ting . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals of the Govern@@ ors of São Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300.000 students will be implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the Protest@@ ants had seen gra@@ ff@@ i@@ ti@@ ts against the provisional President of Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests occurred a few days after demonstr@@ ators went down to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , which was contained in the office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade agreement between Moscow and Tehran rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran has been lifted , the interest of Russian companies in shops grew strongly in the country , shared the Ambassador . &quot;
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , the further trade @-@ building is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trade approach between Russia and Iran during the first five months of the year 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , the Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 per cent in Iran and amoun@@ ted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran grew by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; the merchant recovery has been achieved by deliveries of machines , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the Ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes off for this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year the Russian foreign representatives were around 3@@ 5.000 vis@@ as , first line Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 of countries which concerns the tourist number in Russia . &quot;
&quot; you could say that the record numbers of tourists in Russia last year , broken , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ raz and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition . &quot;
witnesses sought : beverage consumption in Wald@@ br@@ öl over@@ falling
a rob@@ bery of prey on Thurs@@ days on the beverage em@@ ar@@ kt of RE@@ WE XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber Street has been carried out .
&quot; under the maintenance of a loop @-@ weapon demanded three dark dressed people who had their faces , from the staff of the drink ar@@ ctic the crowd of cash and then stopped at first by walking and then probably with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was exploited , the police do not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetrators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1,@@ 70 meters in size , so relatively small . &quot;
the drink is directly accessible from the parking level of the RE@@ WE market and is poorly observ@@ able .
&quot; the perpetrators must be sc@@ anned out after crossing in direction of Ger@@ ber @-@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Path and from that opposite the par@@ haus@@ er car park with the sil@@ ber@@ colored car , possibly towards B 256 ( tro@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
&quot; who made observations for the time ( against 19.@@ 45 p.m. ) observations , which stand in connection with the rob@@ bery , is urgent to report to the police . &quot;
nail : game and fun at summer time
&quot; eight nice and joyful days spent the children and young people of the S pedago@@ gical group , with their supervis@@ ors on their summer time in N@@ uss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ l@@ acker . &quot;
in the quietly situated Frei@@ ght Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle was the life @-@ joyful group during the first school holiday week .
several whole day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; for one time , it went to the board with the visit of the stro@@ z@@ oos . &quot;
&quot; on the other way to the mu@@ n bron@@ n , where there was a special inf@@ estation at the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third trip led to P@@ for@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Kel@@ ley Museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group experienced a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days of pleasure , the group felt at the Tie@@ fen@@ see in the Sh@@ bron@@ n , which was invited for jumping , swimming and plann@@ er . &quot;
&quot; culinary children and car@@ ers were pampered by their own body@@ guards as the aci@@ dic sp@@ ar , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in workshops was bath@@ ed , beautiful jewelry pieces made of beads and stones , or made of wood a Roman mill . &quot;
&quot; other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te evening . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of home , eighth the sun and the children and young people returned home . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pil@@ es at the gate of mercy
the min@@ is@@ tran@@ ts from the past@@ oral minister E@@ ach tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the road on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together we have been doing four stages .
&quot; in order to bridge the period up to the next Rom@@ â@@ ts of all Min@@ is@@ tran@@ ts in the last two years , the Ober@@ min@@ is@@ tran@@ ten@@ round St. Anna has decided to prepare and conduct a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage targets have been reviewed and finally decided for the Ep@@ is@@ cop@@ stadt of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , which opened a special pilgrimage site at the Fran@@ burger Münster . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from the Bitt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ rooms rose on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening previously , pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and divided the pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b by train to the starting point Vill@@ ingen , where there was also a Münster Un@@ ser@@ er beloved wife , and so the pilgrimage away from the Münster . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were killed in the morning and in the evening , depending on a short impulse with various prayers , songs and writing . &quot;
&quot; but also on the road , the Min@@ is to Gras@@ shop@@ pers , chap@@ els or churches and again and again R@@ ast to sing together a song from independent pilgrims . &quot;
for the nights were at the disposal of the local par@@ ishes at the disposal of the local par@@ ishes .
&quot; at the Et@@ app@@ enzi@@ ed Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller for a sav@@ our@@ y as well as for dinner and breakfast .
it continued on the second day at Fur@@ tw@@ ave to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; tags at the end of the day was the stage after St. Peter , which was the stren@@ uous path , but at first there were some 500 al@@ timeter @-@ meter , and afterwards will be heard again . &quot;
the earned reward was in the evening a common gri@@ lling on the beach .
&quot; after the dawn on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter , it went to the Schl@@ us@@ set@@ book to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is met at the later afternoon at the Frei@@ burger Münster and passed the gate of mercy . &quot;
with a little impulse here God was thanks .
&quot; at the Abend@@ messe in Münster , which were welcomed at the Pil@@ gri@@ m Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert . &quot;
after the worship the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ r@@ isty and the skyscrapers .
the next day was still time for the Bre@@ is@@ gau@@ ge metropolis .
afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
&quot; at the end , all participants agree that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling .
Scotland &apos;s call for Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory as the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the nag@@ ging role , which had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the young and made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to win a victory of the favour@@ ites New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , England claimed a shocking victory over four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six olymp@@ ic medals . &quot;
she repeated the trick after they took place in London at the train world Championships in London despite the recall Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the passenger Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a Hin@@ der .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap to close the K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton trying to reti@@ re .
Sk@@ inner was the man where they stayed when they saw potential in the vill@@ i that has now un@@ folded .
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y sealed - and Sk@@ inner put in the qualification round a Olympic ord , but in the still@@ s sealed the New Zealand in the first lap . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap , there was a little back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y led the team to front and sk@@ inn@@ ate held it . &quot;
a strategic change made a large part of the transformation in which Hin@@ des in a higher course drove to dec@@ eler@@ ate it and make it Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
&quot; Ho@@ y saw from his position as a BBC expert , and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they rose up on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am just here to do my best and make a name for me .
we have been in the final round of an Olympi@@ ac@@ ord and defeated the world champion .
it was simply unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 at the side Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys gave Hin@@ des that he was cro@@ pped off after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no objection of England Riv@@ alen .
this time has never been such a problem .
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; it feels with all the GB flags at the Tri@@ bun@@ es like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
&quot; we have come so badly with so many world titles , that it was incredible to win at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation who have won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London . &quot;
if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months is that we expect a successful five days in Vel@@ od@@ rom .
&quot; with the shape Kenn@@ ys , it is in the area of imagin@@ able that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory from three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; this would mean for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger B@@ ann@@ ister ) were born - an explo@@ iters of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
the cheese of the Ho@@ y same .
&quot; Kenn@@ y is next in the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go over three days . &quot;
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot;
the team @-@ event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; saying , &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be be@@ aten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only Med@@ al competition in the day , but there were more good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified yourself with the fastest performance in the Vi@@ ver @-@ four @-@ kilometer race . &quot;
they arrived at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
&quot; the world record , which was won in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; today , the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition , at which Wig@@ gins will be in focus . &quot;
&quot; he had donated himself to the qualification before the qualification , when it smells , to measure his body size . &quot;
&quot; the contest &apos;s contest , continued and finished tomorrow , av@@ anced Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world world war in 4 : 13.@@ 260 . &quot;
the UK team leaves his strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a flock .
after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down .
&quot; it played in the background as the resignation of the Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April , in the midst of sex and bullying , as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ leton . &quot;
&quot; however , when one sees the first evening of competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like this is the legendary call GB@@ s that has reached the perfect moment its culmin@@ ation again . &quot;
future of melt by Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy process
&quot; the future of aluminum mel@@ tdown in Victoria - as well as hundreds of new jobs by workers - stand on the game , since the plant operator will cancel the energy supplier and thus supply all delivery contracts , as the supplier of energy companies . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant . &quot;
a total of 20 years is scheduled to run in November .
&quot; up to 2000 jobs in the facility of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land , are standing on the game . &quot;
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be endangered at a closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the melting of around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vict@@ ori@@ as consumed . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa joined the Point Henry Sch@@ mel@@ t@@ ei , which led last year to a closure of the an@@ ean power station . &quot;
the melting away from Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risk a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulations in terms of the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of its electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminum unit with his Lo@@ y Yang A power station in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared with that three other owners will cancel their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , where the Chinese company CI@@ TIC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L also goes out that the plant in Port@@ land continues to operate , which means more physical demand for electricity through the melting system , &quot; distributed the company . &quot;
AG@@ L continued to say that the agreements so called &quot; backup transactions &quot; should have been in force from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; thus , AG@@ L is from that the Treaties in the fiscal year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential implications for the revenue at AG@@ L from G@@ J 18 are currently restricted by the forecasts of strong appointments for wholesale prices .
&quot; AG@@ L shared with that the value of the Treaties already written in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; expectation of an cancellation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate &quot; &quot; ability to operate &quot; &quot; or to guarantee the power supply to the melting system . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said that there was a 20 @-@ year deal with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have entered into force from November this year , even though it is still a statement , why it came back from the contract . &quot;
analy@@ st warn of the bad economic relations of the industry in front of the possible closure of Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near Newcastle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of the analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen was said to consume around 600 mega@@ watts and Tom@@ ago about 900 mega@@ watts . &quot;
&quot; if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as power producers that would not be good , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a car@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner Clan@@ s Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der is and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this Co@@ vers for wines , wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ v@@ eiling of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre res ( or just Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans ) , such as the cover of her sister and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as it ends with a classical turn : they all have a surprise party planned . &quot;
&quot; this represents the kl@@ is@@ che@@ ek@@ y action almost every birthday sep@@ tic of a children &apos;s return ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the proposition , &quot; you can@@ did not forget that we would have forgotten you ? &quot; , with the honesty of a cartoon cake at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to leave their other girls somehow to this publicity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , certainly a new era of the car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans started . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls great sister Kim , she likes to have be@@ aten the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a League for itself . &quot;
the September issue is for Vo@@ gue the most popular issue of the year .
&quot; with a girth which resembles rather a picture band as a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of advertisers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the grove in 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;

&quot; in recent years , there were clearly more &quot; celebrities , the Mod@@ ules &quot; &quot; as &quot; Mod@@ els , &quot; the celebrities &quot; are on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had honor . &quot;
&quot; but even at the small chance that Mrs J@@ enner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; break@@ ings &quot; &quot; of their generation - under the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot;
&quot; these celebrities are not related to famous people or Reality stars or young people from today , who know how to rot@@ ate a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even though it &apos;s all of that den@@ omin@@ ator . ) &quot;
you are really talented women who exc@@ el in the entertainment industry .
&quot; once published on the last cover , Be@@ y@@ once appeared , with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade , one of the most successful years of their career . &quot;
&quot; of course , Jen@@ ners enjoy success not everyone . &quot;
&quot; with its Reality @-@ TV history , Jen@@ ners position in the fashion world was always something tense . &quot;
&quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called her &quot; the pieces of eye . &quot;
these feelings were very high again when the message with the Er@@ gue Jen@@ ners came out on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but to ride on the mis@@ carriage seems to pass through the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
they sold out of her made pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the Bulletin .
and in her free time she is in Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
&quot; a total of 16@@ ,000 people each year from now on . &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0.000 of the country &apos;s relief centers are being rejected annually by the municipal centers , while the industry took place on the effects of other medi@@ tations to already over@@ sized transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland , three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ e@@ gi@@ ants and similar parties - with their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ loaded , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , this legal centers will be further 30 percent of their Federal Ministry . &quot;
&quot; the director of the Common Assembly centres of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said , that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal centers revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected every year . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the Federal Government , Far@@ rell said that the government would only become worse without the abolition of the pro@@ vocation of the German government . &quot;
&quot; Queens@@ land centres Centr@@ es are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people are of important services that you need to be rejected . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , people with confusing and op@@ pressive debts , families who were dischar@@ ged through separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot obtain the help they need . &quot;
&quot; in June 2017 , the federal government will be cut by 30 percent as of June 2017 , which means that thousands of helpful people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call on the General Secretary General and Federal Minister of Ministers and Sen@@ ators from Queensland George Bran@@ dis to un@@ cover these mid @-@ shortest possible , so people can get the help they need to have legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the State Government comp@@ lied its commitment to raise funds for guidance on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to view the needs of the community centres and their customer communities , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign charged with employee supposedly weapon
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ umps Camp@@ a@@ ign has been indicted for alleged in@@ action , after having communicated that their struggle manager for North Carolina , had directed a shot on an employee , while in February in a je@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , which was submitted on Wednesday in the Prince of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software program for the campaign in this federal state . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ i gave it to have been waiting for months , that the matter would be regulated internally before he realized that &quot; this would not happen . &quot;

&quot; having compl@@ ained during the local and regional struggle management , B@@ ordin@@ i noted that already at least four other persons had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he gave the indictment in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the indictment has only spent two days after the Republi@@ can presidential elections , as he spoke of a crowd in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment of people &quot; - should take action and weapon @-@ mates in case his Ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton should be elected and judge . &quot;
&quot; tr@@ umps campaign was clear that the media would have torn down his words from the context , and that he would not rise to violence . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ is complaint demands damages from the campaign for the violation of duty to duty and from Philip because of the injury and abi@@ ding psychological damages . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey on European elections : SPD and CD@@ U lost
&quot; at the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4th September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , there are significant losses for government parties and CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; this will be representative surveys of the opinion research scientist IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black governmental coalition could continue in the north almost further , this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states the SPD would be the strongest party , and it would have good opportunities to continue the government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD decreased by 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in five years ago on 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party sm@@ iles only just under the CD@@ U that could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ d .
&quot; the Left Opposition was at 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented with 19 percent for the first time in the country . &quot;
&quot; despite easier losses with 6 percent ( previously , 8.@@ 7 percent ) again in the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 per cent in the country &apos;s day .
&quot; according to the Berlin Chamber of Represent@@ atives , the SPD of the survey was estimated that only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent to 2@@ 3.4 per cent .
it still sm@@ iles behind the Greens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) but before the left with 15 percent ( prior to 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Represent@@ atives .
&quot; with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would be missed in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9@@ 000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in time lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came on the market .
the followers today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device wo@@ g almost a half kilo@@ gram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thicker and bigger , it was therefore not good in hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite clo@@ w@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was initially eight Meg@@ ab@@ y@@ tes , which would now range for about two sel@@ fs with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ yte .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9@@ 000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the business - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few Euros , lovers of the devices can still buy in the internet , but they are somehow drawn from the St@@ one@@ age of the internet era . &quot;
but 20 years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months previously at the CeBIT Fair in Hanover as an &quot; office in the West@@ field format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent to then standards a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible by HTML @-@ browser , if also agon@@ is@@ ingly slow . &quot;
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop . &quot;
then found a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
&quot; the price was quite proud of the price : 2@@ 700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphones in Germany was 2015 at 3@@ 92 Euro .
nobody could see in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia too .
&quot; the cell @-@ savings of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft . &quot;
today they dominate the market today that all have come a lot later than Nokia .
&quot; ever and wherever it is online , this is today a lot of people everyday life . &quot;
2015 there have been almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
&quot; sold around 1.4 billion devices , Samsung and Apple are alone 5@@ 55 million copies . &quot;
global sales with the devices is around 400 billion euros .
&quot; for this purpose , the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and tele@@ communication companies come from . &quot;
around the smartphone has been created quite a whole industry .
&quot; only at the beginning of 2007 , Apple @-@ Chief Steve Jobs announced on the Mac @-@ World launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communication , all easy to use by touch @-@ screen . &quot;
the victory of Apple began even today is the iPhone the most important product of the Group .
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market had to see . &quot;
&quot; you disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sa@@ ws have now Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
&quot; in the cut , each Germans now look on his cell for 88 times a day . &quot;
&quot; we have to learn all the smartphone , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina ball , &quot; said in the Siemens @-@ Management Board for personnel . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now valid as a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must direct the olymp@@ ic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
&quot; He@@ a@@ throw is not only used in our local authorities and throughout London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; for me , it was the largest attraction He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as it was in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to make sure all of our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and we will achieve this again by creating new possibilities for local and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities we will already create 10,000 new apprenti@@ ce , 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment at the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , it will be such that the challenge of enlargement he@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too large . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ ate ourselves on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had injustice and they will be wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ a@@ throw answers every question asked . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individual infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; enlargement is a way to create up to 18@@ 0@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to funny growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and in the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have implemented a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , was elected by T@@ 5 - the five years in a row of the world &apos;s best airport terminal . &quot;
now they are ready to deliver a third install@@ ment which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the He@@ a@@ throw enlargement will also be one .
&quot; it is time for us to move this olymp@@ ic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw , as well as securing our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of England . &quot;

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; with regard to display shiel@@ ds &quot;
&quot; for companies who earn money with Online@@ advertising make money come according to one of the software manufacturer attempts , ad @-@ block@@ ers to handle , a &quot; sound and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there would be scor@@ eboard on his desktop site , released Ad@@ block Plus a blo@@ gger where users could update their filters in the program to re@@ block advertising on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared with that his Des@@ k@@ top@@ side would change the enco@@ ding on its advertisements in order to make it scor@@ ching the detection on which part of the page adver@@ ts is to make it difficult . &quot;
&quot; however , Ad@@ block announced that there was a new way to handle the new codes . &quot;
&quot; in a blo@@ gger Ben Williams , the speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ battle between the in@@ quired open source community and the transformations are already underway since the invention of scor@@ eboard during the invention , and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world @-@ largest company has established itself in the struggle for social media , has become a strong signal for how worrying scor@@ eboard for the industry has become . &quot;
&quot; according to a study from the last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people are used to scor@@ ching up ; almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users that access Facebook via their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung is making 84 percent of the advertising revenue took place on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; the company has no effect on display block@@ ers on desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on fac@@ ebooks mobile app for social network and inst@@ agram , distributed a speaker . &quot;
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large proportion of revenues so Facebook appears to be the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared Facebook with that it would be &quot; &quot; scor@@ ned pool &quot; &quot; to update the people more control over it . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook predicted that Ad@@ diction new filters were worrying , because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the user , this is not a positive experience , therefore we are planning to address the issue , shared an speaker of Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we have focused instead on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control in the hands of the people . &quot;
women with suspected su@@ icide on Swiss motorway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the motorway .
the police calls witnesses to witness after a woman in the early hours of the morning on Thursday with a suspected su@@ icide of several vehicles on a highway .
&quot; the incident occurred on the A1 , near the Morges , in the canton of V@@ aud , shortly after midnight . &quot;
&quot; a woman laid out in the dark &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; on the streets and were taken by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a sweat at the age of 49 years , which was passed by several vehicles , including a truck , was going to kill myself . &quot;
it still died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police officers , who call these , and every witness of the incident . &quot;
&quot; it was opened an investigation procedure , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , the Gilles Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter shared the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gene@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a clash avoidable ?
&quot; this is something that the pro@@ secutor has to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accountable .
in each of the two cases - in which a person was running in the dark on the highway - was decided that motor@@ cyclists do not have to assume that a pedest@@ rians run in the middle of the night on the highway as it meant in the newspaper .
&quot; last year , a poli@@ ce@@ ist of the rac@@ er kill@@ ings was acqu@@ itted after they survived and killed a man who was in August 2014 one night on the A1 , near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and has become unconscious on the road . &quot;
&quot; the court established that the poli@@ cem@@ an answered in a call @-@ call -- on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely exceptional and unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should contact the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA Climate am@@ od@@ ell : Venus once was hab@@ itable
the Venus was most likely to be inhab@@ itable according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model .
&quot; at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies , the NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms , which are similar to those of climate research . &quot;
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether Venus with its hot , waterproof surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere was once recorded . &quot;
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow orbit of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; however , the latest simulation points to that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere and slowly moved on . &quot;
the model also illumin@@ ates the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet was probably more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and to be more quickly black@@ out . &quot;
early Venus also prof@@ ited from a Sun which was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS modelling simulation , the slow revolutions of the Venus trans@@ duc@@ ed their daily side of the sun almost two months , &quot; &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io &quot; stated in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like a rainbow in order to shield the surface from a large part of the sun heat . &quot;
&quot; the result is average temperatures , which are a few degrees cooler than that of the earth today . &quot;
the model brought forth a story of Venus that is similar to evolution that had previously suspected of planetary research .
&quot; although it was probably hab@@ itable , Venus was exposed in the course of several billion years --@@ zu@@ y much heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
&quot; their oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated , and its water vap@@ or was blown away by the ultra @-@ violet light . &quot;
as their hydr@@ o @-@ sand@@ wich only remained a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus in which we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy goes back as a coach of Aval@@ ai@@ che
&quot; Patrick Roy appeared on Thursday as a coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations in Colorado , and led to a low level of co @-@ making process for the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; in the last three years I have met my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations in Colorado , with energy , passion and determination . &quot;
&quot; in the course of summer , I think long and much about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , this requires it and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and the Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly adapted to the organization . &quot;
he also has to have a co @-@ determination for decisions that affect the team &apos;s performance .
these conditions are currently not met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had been ch@@ illed to Roy on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions for the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy has been awarded the Jack Adams Awards during his debut season in 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
&quot; he led the Club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was be@@ aten in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed the post@@ season in each of the last two years . &quot;
the description signed in the season 2015 @-@ 16 a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the game for a second wild card spot at the Western Conference by five points .
&quot; as Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the description . &quot;
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers will resume talks to put strike from
&quot; the working class in respect of the remun@@ eration for Nord@@ se@@ e@@ öl@@ workers are exposed , while all dispute parties are set for a new talk round at the table , we said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; strikes against the oil field service providers wood Group were carried spor@@ adic@@ ally on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell . &quot;
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and r@@ ammed trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to re @-@ begin the resolution process of the current stretching process , &quot; it is said in a common statement . &quot;
&quot; we will keep some full @-@ day sessions over the next weeks , starting the beginning of next year to re @-@ address the problems . &quot;
&quot; the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , a protest against potential wage rates of up to 30 percent . &quot;
wood Group has been trun@@ cated this year at its contracts in North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company abbrevi@@ ation of the company follows a 10 % decline for on@@ shore Con@@ tractor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company gives the needed space to get through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; Shell has released plans for its part of thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , since it ration@@ alized its business activities as a result of his Meg@@ az@@ re@@ uth with British energy companies BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure , economic situation due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that has increased by the British decision in June , the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish parliament@@ arians member arrived at the beginning of this week with workers leaders in order to discuss one of the largest unemployment activities , which have been taking place since a generation in the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1,4 billion are expected to spend new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures Rot@@ ation rate of stars in the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
&quot; the latest mission with Ke@@ pler &apos;s space tel@@ escope helped astronom@@ ers to collect the complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; the new data will help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars are rotating in the star cluster , as well as in which connection the rotation periods are with the planetary genesis . &quot;
&quot; we hope we experience through the comparisons between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; &quot; Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this cluster have emerged , which originated about 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood . &quot;
they are now turning at the fastest .
&quot; at peak rot@@ ations , this gri@@ pping stars encounter large amounts of star@@ es . &quot;
&quot; as these winds are travelling through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a bre@@ wing effect on the stars . &quot;
if a star doesn &apos;t change his rotation rate begins to dec@@ eler@@ ate .
&quot; Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star , by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star@@ spot -- like sun@@ spots . &quot;
the latest catalogue of Rot@@ ation rates pointed out that massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slower than smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; b@@ allet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors will tend to be massive , whereas spe@@ eding rot@@ ors will tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the cluster of the ple@@ ads is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities as rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; it is still a lot about what we would like to know more about how the how , When and why stars will slow@@ down their rotation rates and so to speak their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and their colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the A@@ stronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball star comes out

&quot; three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player of the League , 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series . &quot;
his signature under a tenth year @-@ year deal has been awarded a total of 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
&quot; by the end of the contrac@@ tion on 31 December 2017 , he will be working as a consultant and youth coach . &quot;
as a player it paid Rodri@@ guez a long time with power .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 H@@ its and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; &quot; R@@ uns &quot; &quot; ) for Seattle Nav@@ ers ( 2001 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; with Hall of Fame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two additional bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics are similar values . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old form may not be taken up to the 41 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; for so successful Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field was , so controversial is his appearance beyond the square . &quot;
&quot; as early as 2009 , the super@@ star was killed in &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was suspended until the end of 2014 for 211 games by the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez is considered the main suspi@@ cious of years to have received more than an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
after a dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; the league could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played a break for 20 years without having a break , &quot; Rodri@@ guez said at that time . &quot;
even his farewell days do not go no@@ is@@ eless .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games still receive the big stage , Rodri@@ guez had to be sitting on the bank . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes trying to win any game , &quot; &quot; Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;

Olympic 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa and Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski are first Dop@@ ing@@ accidents
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing sample may not start with wei@@ ght@@ the@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 is over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by the first official Dop@@ ing@@ cases .
a caught athle@@ te had almost won a medal .
&quot; before the seventh competition day , the first official Dop@@ ing@@ incidents became known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 m @-@ obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight @-@ the@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski have been positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critical athle@@ tics competition come this news at the time . &quot;
Ch@@ en has been proven the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de last Sunday that is used as a mas@@ tic means for dop@@ ing instances .
&quot; the International Sport@@ court yard CA@@ S confirmed the exclusion of the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon , excluding the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the finals about 100 m butter@@ fly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds , they missed the bronze . &quot;
on Friday Ch@@ en should have participated in the processes above 50 m Fre@@ isti@@ l .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ rehearsal at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; the national association should take the matter &quot; very seriously and demands of Ch@@ en full co @-@ operation at the investigations , &quot; zi@@ pped X@@ in@@ hua : &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ s@@ shof CA@@ S and will accept the decision . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the refurb@@ ishment of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio z@@ oo@@ ed the news about the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on to the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this is &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she told the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; be inno@@ cent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said to act on the bot@@ tled substance to act the blood @-@ offering EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa was suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should also be very positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov announces itself immediately with criticism of the Ath@@ ena &apos; word .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; said : &quot; we are Bulg@@ arians at observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , about all weights from the chron@@ ically proven nation must not take part in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case of &quot; Adrian Target in@@ ski &quot; was also known , the London Olympics in the class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier positively to the an@@ abolic stero@@ ids N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
both may deny the intake , both of them must not start in class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the athle@@ tics , Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa is another harder blow for the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the World Association IA@@ AF had banned the whole Russian team except for systematic dop@@ ing to the start , even the L@@ äu@@ nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming pool , the former periods in China also had taken care of fierce disputes between the athletes . &quot;
the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese olymp@@ asi@@ eger Sun yang .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ ing@@ li@@ la , &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium about 200 m Fre@@ isti@@ l , I want to pass , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also at the center of a confrontation with the Australi@@ ans M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun had been positively tested with the Chinese champi@@ onships , but had to have had a positive effect on the stimul@@ ant of the Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ de in 2014 . &quot;
Dat@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de pres@@ sen h@@ acker her ran@@ som
compres@@ sing mal@@ ware are currently targeted companies - and are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey of the mal@@ ware @-@ defense experts Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surve@@ yed companies were at least once , in the past twelve months at least once , partially several times a attack with black@@ ma@@ ser software . &quot;
in Germany nearly 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion .
40 percent of the victims paid will@@ ingly the sol@@ vent requested by the perpetrators to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetrators specialised in their black@@ ma@@ ser software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potentially exp@@ ir@@ ate ran@@ som is much higher than for private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a start@@ ling fast evolution of damage software , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes leader Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programmes were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetrators discovered black@@ mailing software for itself .
&quot; first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks occurred within the last months , was start@@ ling quickly . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it searches for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ cloud , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encrypted the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the originality .
then the software presents the demands of the black@@ ma@@ ser .
&quot; to get the end @-@ key code to the files , the victims need money - mostly in the form of the Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ gen Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where private users are using the personal photo database in the game , it is about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is still tac@@ kled . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the German firms concerned by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to break completely under way of operation , in a case humans were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , many hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of hospitals . &quot;
&quot; we say to the victims always : pays not , you only promotes the problem , &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data back again . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of offen@@ ders in the face of a stand@@ still . &quot;
the h@@ ackers again know that and try to establish a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure obtained the commercial space and get the contact with black@@ mail@@ ers and come to the result : the perpetrators are actually trying to establish a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain to their victims by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , direct access @-@ accessible support websites or de@@ code free example files . &quot;
&quot; and will be re@@ vis@@ ing individuals after payments of a few hundred euros , companies need to pay partly hard and five digits figures to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ black@@ mail , the h@@ acker will always be professional and share the work , explains the security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of Anti@@ virus @-@ provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware circa within a week . &quot;
&quot; more likely , it is that it is about three or four people . &quot;
the programmers sell their pollutants in the form of a software construction to the actual ex@@ pres@@ sor .
&quot; the previous mal@@ ware kits were created by the mal@@ ware itself , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the scope of delivery is an adaptation tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ mailing are then looking for further h@@ ackers in order to spread the fresh software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so you log in one of the forums in the underground , buy the set of a criminal and asked another to install the software on as many PCs . &quot;
payment is made per in@@ calcul@@ ated machine .
&quot; usually instruc@@ t the criminals then sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that secure their data .
&quot; over 50 percent of companies IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey rely on it , Ran@@ som@@ ware will be able to rep@@ el off file @-@ back @-@ ups and Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful testing , the perpetrators are instead of publishing sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing policies , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes leader Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the claim for damages is higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpetrators could in future take completely new goals on the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrated security researchers , how they could control a thermo@@ stat in their control with the internet . &quot;
in the middle of winter the activation of such a lock bra@@ ised heating could be quite a sol@@ vent .
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ator then instead of blocking the heating in the future to block an entire production road in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware may also be a subject in the Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and omni@@ direc@@ tional
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda will pack everything : a little S@@ UV , a little cou@@ pe , and also the versatility of a mini@@ vans . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , however the HR @-@ V that was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the front row and in the F@@ ond . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and seem pleasant , only the cock@@ pit upper side falls down there . &quot;
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in storage .
&quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l , at high @-@ set and 10@@ 26 l with cl@@ oned back , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical when it sounds : the seating areas of the back@@ bench can be cl@@ amped up like Kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel and thus offer storage space , which is high from floor up to blankets 1.@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the trunk is well ventil@@ ated , however , the loader with 650 mm is slightly higher than with the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
&quot; the tested 1.6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP speeds up the HR @-@ V thanks to torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges , very powerful . &quot;
&quot; however , he should do something qui@@ eter for his work . &quot;
&quot; encouraging is the everyday consumption of 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km . &quot;
another mot@@ orization : a 1.5 @-@ l @-@ gasoline with 96 kW / 130 HP .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the vehicle behavior is balanced and a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
&quot; however , the steering is likely to be a little more direct . &quot;
&quot; the equipment can be made in the tested top version &quot; Executive , &quot; no wishes un@@ fulfilled . &quot;
&quot; among the security systems belongs to the City @-@ Not@@ bra@@ king assistant ( works by speed 32 ) , the coll@@ isions @-@ war@@ n@@ system and the sp@@ ur@@ inary assistant . &quot;
&quot; the coll@@ isions @-@ war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ated , because in the ran@@ gers many obstacles are evaluated as &quot; her@@ ing objects &quot; . &quot; &quot;
very reliable works of the television super@@ visor .
and the intelligent tem@@ por@@ um responds to the traffic detection and d@@ ros@@ ine when needed the speed .
&quot; however , the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and more . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI jack is under arm@@ rest and therefore are a bit awk@@ ward .
the approximately 29@@ 000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel are fine .
&quot; who does not want to invest so much , receives the petrol from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 Euro . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 @-@ subscription standard .
with the HR @-@ V Honda offers a versatile and ever@@ lasting car .
Air@@ line is not liable : over@@ throwing on passenger bridge
an Air@@ line is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
&quot; for a liability is conceivable only in dangers that are typical of air traffic , the Supreme Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee injury in the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could possibly happen everywhere - it is a general risk of life , so the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
disease cases : when paid the organizer
&quot; after their trip , holiday@@ makers will only get money back when the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ ful in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; this , however , is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have proven the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the untreated case , a family was severely ill on the second day of their door@@ bell hard on diar@@ rhe@@ a and vom@@ iting . &quot;
she has spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their disorder led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a def@@ ective se@@ wage plant that allegedly had poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family was the view that the trip had been a lack - and compl@@ ained against the organizer .
in court the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had no success .
although the se@@ wage plant was in fact def@@ ective .
&quot; however , the organis@@ er only came before leaving the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff . &quot;
he had to assume that the sea water was fine .
&quot; he has not violated his information duties , so the judgment . &quot;
especially since during the rehear@@ sals there were no contam@@ in@@ ants found .
&quot; the condition of several hotel guests - perhaps as a result of the infection , belong to one another - belonging to the general risk of living . &quot;
from 6@@ 91 guests only 38 fell ill .
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the violence perpetr@@ ated by refugees in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach in July many people had concern for further attacks . &quot;
the state had to be n@@ uns and determined at the same time responding to the terrorist acts .
sure : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hate and separation .
this triumph we will not treat the terrorists .
&quot; if criminal offen@@ ders had to leave the country , but the safety and strength of the population is also the approval of the population for the refugee policy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère I want to achieve an implementation of proposals up to the Bundestag in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; he also announced another person@@ al rein@@ forcement of security forces , namely &quot; in the middle @-@ fourth order of magnitude over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ ies for terrorism must be under punishment .
&quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the weapons can be enforced on the Internet , especially the purchase of weapons on the internet . &quot;
&quot; the most recently much discussed welding , for doctors should stay in words after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères . &quot;
&quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the sle@@ eves , as the danger of citizens can be reduced , he said with a look at mental ti@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers better social support . &quot;
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ sed people .
&quot; for the persecution of criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of an investig@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to safety further . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Interior Minister clearly spoke against shareholders . &quot;
&quot; that was an ear @-@ party for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double citizenship before .
a general prohibition of full @-@ conce@@ al@@ ment it is not legally problematic .
&quot; you can not for@@ bid everything you re@@ jects , and I rest the wearing of the Bur@@ ka . &quot;
talk about rules about road traffic or to witness against judgment .
&quot; green Chief in Simone Peter raised the Minister , he wants to simul@@ ate with ever new anti @-@ terrorist acts and acts of action . &quot;
&quot; left @-@ party chief Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet fuel and a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the common right bring the human right to this country no more security . &quot;
better traffic signs on the motorway exit
a regular basis on the road map - here is a picture from November .
&quot; however , this is supposed to change : the dispute resolution should be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all the car of the drivers , which are on the ambient road every evening in St@@ au , if they go over the motorway &quot; &quot; Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; the road operation is extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , in the area between the hammer road and the Wes@@ tern@@ ers Wes@@ eler road , by 700 meters . &quot;
motor@@ ists can then drive directly from the hammer road to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : traffic cuts down early , whereby the overall performance sequence is improved on the diverse section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
the idea of the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of the representation of Münster @-@ West .
the driving force on the dri@@ br@@ is fre@@ t the motor@@ ist above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the back@@ rest goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes also beyond . &quot;
&quot; for reason , the needle is on the B 51 just before the departure Wes@@ tern@@ strasse . &quot;
&quot; from here , the traffic is guided only one lane about the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be re @-@ built before a well @-@ three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the required force , in order to absorb above all the heavy duty drives . &quot;
&quot; how long this Eng@@ pass and the associated trade union daily St@@ au will last , the responsible country is not able to say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to count : because the bridge has an official remaining period up to 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal ab@@ bi@@ e@@ tim@@ ur , the country has deliberately chosen the traffic @-@ weak@@ ened time in the school holidays because with disabilities is expected . &quot;
the traffic will be guided on the construction site on Tuesday and on Wednesday .
Intercultural Travel : culture offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the young theatre are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; Class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has an idea of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The Inv@@ isible House &quot; of the Young Theater Münster .
in the context of the N@@ ima &apos;s initi@@ alled &quot; Intercultural Travel &quot; visited 19 students between eleven and 15 years the staging in the little house .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association dedicated to the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit within the framework of this project cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most of the young people of the class were come from Afghanistan , March 2015 and March 2016 among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and say little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the cens@@ ored pictures and video animations , it has been possible to follow the course of course , thus the press release of the Young Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the young theatre will work in the next season as part of a music theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December young people with and without air and migration background between 14 and 20 years will receive the opportunity to visit professionally managed courses in singing , dance , scenery and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the@@ atri@@ cal and the@@ atri@@ cal lingu@@ istics sector are in the planning .
the project &quot; Intercultural Travel &quot; continues .
&quot; given the Ascen@@ ded refugee figures , the association with many classes who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of star @-@ sn@@ ap : hope for weather @-@ repair
the weather has the star sn@@ ak@@ y Gu@@ ck@@ ans in the South@@ west of Germany during the night to Friday a stand by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night may be bad because of clouds and rain to watch the Himmels@@ spectacle , the chair of the observatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather is supposed to be good , then we certainly see many star sn@@ ap in the sky . &quot;
&quot; with the ast@@ er@@ boards it is per@@ pping , which belong with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the fastest cluster . &quot;
&quot; they have their names , because they apparently come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes in the northeast . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening you get etern@@ ally awake , at night you are awake for hours , the morning is already far before the wake @-@ up ring no more of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , you are with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults are sleeping disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently rest@@ ful . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep in sleep ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there are many causes underlying them , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ar , Board member of the German Society for Sle@@ ep@@ ages and Sle@@ eping Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what you understand , but is the In@@ som@@ nie , so an input and sle@@ ep@@ y disorder . &quot;
&quot; right now , many people feel as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , Board member in the German domestic medical association with practice in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleeping disorders are complex .
&quot; behind it can be organic , mental or mal@@ adjusted factors , but also medicines . &quot;
not rarely is the sleeping expression of another disease .
&quot; very early waking up is especially frequent during depression , &quot; says We@@ e . &quot;
and it can be that different factors would like to take one another .
&quot; if for example has a sli@@ pped disk , it can be bad , guarded every two to three hours and starts to greet you about everyday problems and indul@@ ge , we@@ eds are an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should you use sleeping disorders to the doctor ?
&quot; who is not well vers@@ ed over a period of one month at least three nights per week , and the day is com@@ promised , should go to the doctor , betra@@ ys We@@ e . &quot;
&quot; impairment can look very different : it is down@@ cast , tired , un@@ exhausted , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has m@@ oods or physical discomfort such as stomach or headaches . &quot;
&quot; to rel@@ ieve the sleeping disorder , it is important to find their causes . &quot;
&quot; the treatment options apply to other behavi@@ oral patterns , a cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medication - classic sleeping @-@ coated tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot;
&quot; it is hardly possible in Germany with low @-@ rainf@@ all , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ ber , leader of the interdisciplinary and medical center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; that is why you should first turn in sleeping problems at the dental clinic , betra@@ ys We@@ e . &quot;
it can clarify whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who was to sleep in the bed@@ lab , and what happens there ? &quot;
&quot; for an examination in the sleeping laboratory , medical device , for example with snor@@ ing with respiratory disorders , in disease @-@ fatigue or if one does not find the cause of a sle@@ ep@@ y disorder , Fi@@ ber . &quot;
you do not need to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a lunch , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ ber . &quot;
after bon@@ ding you go to bed at its normal time .
&quot; in addition to the electro@@ des in the body , one is wearing a nose @-@ belt , a chest strap and a mit@@ ter at the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera stands at the ceiling to the bed@@ time . &quot;
how can I get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adju@@ sting screws on which one can put for a better sleep .
&quot; we@@ e counts on : regular sleeping and over@@ lap times , not to sleep long in bed , don &apos;t watch TV to sleep , alcohol , and night do not look at the clock - then you start to reck@@ on right away , and this is quite and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;

&quot; in a country where an Olympics gets 20,000 € premi@@ ums and one jungle k@@ ered 150@@ ,000 € should not be surprised at any lack of missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in the swimming pool is bad , the dop@@ ing controls on the other hand very good . &quot;

airport : ban@@ de of baggage di@@ ke arrested
professional Die@@ be at the Airport Düsseldorf
&quot; the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police managed to take the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years . &quot;
the Tat@@ bran@@ ched had committed as a ban@@ de several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and baggage allowance .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 o civil civil servants in the area of the airport Düsseldorf , a gang again , which was known to the poli@@ c@@ emen from past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several delic@@ ous since mid July of this year , and were very professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the crime Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can come to Di@@ d , who were travelling for crimes to Germany , four acts of action . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they had earned a total of more than 15,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; at the first glance , the Riga @-@ Friedrichs@@ ha@@ in in Berlin @-@ Friedrichs@@ ha@@ in does not affect the first sight yet , but the police counts them among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; walk along the road from east to west , one passes on board , a fres@@ her nursery and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
on the facade of a gray house someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot; sc@@ at@@ edly .
&quot; opposite a Li@@ d@@ l , which should also be demol@@ ished soon , is already built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new rented apartments . &quot;
&quot; articles on this &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichs@@ ha@@ in calls , are pre@@ fers in the last few weeks with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents of rental rates , on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , Hen@@ kel , the Berlin Interior Ministry had been argued for a hard approach to the police against the project , the area called &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for poli@@ c@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomy . &quot;
&quot; after June 22nd the rooms were vac@@ ated on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ iede , with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolling the police with 30 to 40 officials and three teams in front of the place , sper@@ sed parts of the street and kept visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown house@@ holders are the rooms . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July the Berlin Court of Directors decided that the clear@@ ance was illegal , and one day later the police and builders went from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the street looks peace@@ fully : parents walk with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talking about si@@ m sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house @-@ projects there are elementary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
&quot; left violence is not the main attraction of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin New@@ geb@@ auer , who lived in Kiev since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who have three children here , above all are gener@@ alized by the police presence . &quot;
with the inhabitants of the house @-@ projects they share the care of rising r@@ ents and g@@ entri@@ fication .
&quot; it does not sound after a Kie@@ z , who wanted to make itself a uniform police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ on left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , the man of the Berlin interior and the police between domestic workers and their neighbours , does not seem to exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrichs@@ ha@@ in in the east of Berlin was a traditional workers &quot; district , which today compared with the rest of the city a lower average of average income , and high poverty risk . &quot;
&quot; also house@@ ups and the born @-@ born projects have long been occupied for a long time : 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including nearly all the whole Main@@ zer street near the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer was cleared among a large police station , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and were still inhabited by the people who occupied them for 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district of the last few years has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and Leg@@ ber@@ lin@@ ers from all over the world : with them , the inhabitants of the GDR and former home occupied their Kiev . &quot;
&quot; this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents , which since 2009 has risen by nearly 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes it on wor@@ shipped sli@@ ces or freshly painted fac@@ ades that were be@@ amed with color beut@@ ler .
no other road was mentioned this year as often along with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; a reason why not all neighbours can see this as a problem , may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes like the body of the body are according to statistics almost exclusively against poli@@ c@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the most significant part of the crimes are of affairs , the ten@@ den@@ cial sooner the newly built and newly renovated houses meet . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 , there cannot be any talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; in terms of violence , it is important : people in the 94 are their neighbors , which were certainly not . &quot;
&quot; also , the famous burning cars give it right in the Riga no longer . &quot;
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliberately moved into the Rig@@ a@@ er street - and remained .
&quot; for this reason , it was also so important that the inhabitants will withdraw their street : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly interpre@@ ting the clarity about the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of the residents , like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to take them away : through spot@@ ted new buildings in former buildings that sup@@ press the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately re@@ con@@ domini@@ um , which are not interesting for many of this - here are more people living not so well , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction I am absolutely not able to heal . &quot;
&quot; but what should you do , if any one never stops ? &quot;
&quot; on all sides of fru@@ ity , there is also the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for admittedly , who like color @-@ bom@@ bers , Ker@@ stin New@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiev . &quot;
&quot; who goes from , should be aware of it - just like someone who moved to a pub that can &apos;t complain about noise . &quot;
they have asked to be asked not only with their first name ; they do not have to be called by their right name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee camp
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
&quot; furthermore , it is a social worker on site . &quot;
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee camp for Ur@@ bach .
the social pedago@@ gical team supports the team of management around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees itself as a contact person for all players : refugees , working group refugees , administration , authorities and anyone else to mi@@ tig@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from the work group indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the rus@@ hing W@@ oll@@ us@@ ch@@ sau , which has especially a problem . &quot;
some - less spot@@ ting than rather on the multitude of specific tasks - meant as the management wanted to write the place .
&quot; he was sought for a administration with a talent for languages and people , associated with many years of experience in the field of social work , just an experienced W@@ oll@@ us@@ k@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organisation that work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been with it for around six weeks .
it has a 50 per cent place for the period of three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le Ehr@@ - and full @-@ time actors are supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small issues , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
soon there are new containers in the washing road
&quot; for some time , it has been recognized for some time to find apartments for the connection of connection , which have been acknowledged . &quot;
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
you must accomo@@ date the refugees in their own or rented dormit@@ ories .
&quot; the cost of building , rent or renov@@ ations of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the property for the Commune and job center .
problem : there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his home .
the search has been designed very difficult for some time .
de facto the administration finds no private apartments .
&quot; so far , don &apos;t have to rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , communities must be visited as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so , soon new containers will be set up in the washing road . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , the Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a solid base , it is an internship , training places , school courts , one @-@ euro jobs and helpl@@ ess activities for refugees and migrants that have to be found or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help home@@ work , do charitable work - and this motivated and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community is leading to a positive influence .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day need a fixed structure , say deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a lack of confidence .
&quot; so , you need offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so you also jump to the management and volunteers .
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; you have to explain the refugees that it just takes and they can control the time in a sense , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who will eventually develop the feeling , he could not help in Ur@@ bach , do not work , and be un@@ selfish , who will never be integrated . &quot;
the clear majority may be motivated .
&quot; however , there is also a customer that says honestly , &quot; people in which nothing is going on . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : have the two after the recent incidents fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine says clearly , &quot; &quot; what man@@ ia may be called na@@ ï@@ ve &quot; . &quot; a Res@@ tr@@ isi@@ ko can and doesn &apos;t want to exclude them . &quot;
sensi@@ ti@@ zed is the hel@@ pers but already .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks will bring them completely into dis@@ call .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , main - and volunteers must keep on site and in the region according to activities . &quot;
they have always in the background that soon a new shock of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach soon .
Germany needs a cap ?
this question is clear to answer .
&quot; actually , it is unfair to place it hel@@ pers on the spot . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not yet arrived , where we would like to &quot; , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees would be able to relax .
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that Ur@@ bacher are already in exu@@ ber@@ ant , so that the people are functioning properly so far . &quot;
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , one should help them both women agree . &quot;
the political world situation is so complicated there is no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : her@@ bre@@ cher searched with helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew about an hour of different areas - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are rolled out on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 o &apos;clock in an apartment in an apartment house in Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the residents surprised the two and suggested the un@@ hol@@ den into the escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ king , both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black Kap@@ u@@ zen@@ kan@@ lis . &quot;
it stretches in the direction of downtown .
&quot; on the flag@@ ged , the police took several stri@@ ps , as well as a police helicopter . &quot;
the flag@@ ging was running without success .
perhaps the unknown before the apartment fell close to the apartment or with their escape .
