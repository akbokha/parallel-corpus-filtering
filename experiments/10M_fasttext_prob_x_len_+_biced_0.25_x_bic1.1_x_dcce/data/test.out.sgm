<seg id="11">"he left himself with his family about the installation of the ALRV, on a horse, he didn't try to look for photo purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German Sports Centre handed over to the man from Anhausen as part of a small Gala in the Golden Sportpyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">With awards it lacks the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundesworship Leaders, silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions Tour-Player of the Year..."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clin's and Trumps Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP - that is both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential elections are however in control and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, more philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">Control of the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small, and warning about how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton destroys the economy to death and regulate death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claims a ump."</seg>
<seg id="9">He will massively return regulations and he is strong for a far-reaching control reform with lower tax approaches - for individuals and businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the contrary, says: the state has certain tasks to perform, he has disadvantage and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"that is why the taxes for the rich would be increased, she says."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has to be invested, say Trump and Clinton nearly wortequal."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic Candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teapy-wing of the Republican.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump you could send partial internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">More evident are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build carbon power stations and resume the coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil-mining should also be possible in so far protected areas - the Paris mitigation agreement wants to announce.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand and demands renewable energies with their investment programme:" a country will create the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want we are."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"PP, the transpazide Trade Agreement, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both the United States doesn't want to isolate the United States from international trade, but only to protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"this should also be better paid, for example Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger fee.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it on 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says, the minimum wage must be, then he says, he should not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand Trump, the economy and the citizens want to relieve the growth to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics hold him before, so the budget deficit would be even greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who at least want to ask for the rich that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="2">"sexual violence is part of women who alone flee, almost to everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany they are often traumatized.</seg>

<seg id="5">There are four women in a big kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby with a maximum of one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in the arm.</seg>

<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it is the business leader of Condrobs, a carrier of social aid offerings in Bavaria, and deals with women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen were stuffed.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in Munich north in one of the few decentralised accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs made the establishment of Pro Familia and the Munich's Women's Aid relief.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently she was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men do not exist - also not as visitors.</seg>

<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has done on her escape experience with sexual violence," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because they are politically pursued because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a hope of hope to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="24">"women are far outweigh other reasons for the escape:" many stealing themselves secretly, because they do not see another way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in her home, they have experienced experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honorary murders, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run this goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tractor for example ask for a bottle of water an sexual act, is not rarity," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="29">"women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that as soon as they anchor in Germany, irre, tells bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too many women in refugee-events would often be considered inferior and worst if misused.</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to about 90 percent of women who live in the area of Munich, in Munich, are estimated to be traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are as usual that they have nothing to say.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't trust, openly talk about the experience, because the shame is too large."</seg>
<seg id="36">"as they often don't have to help, there are more accommodations just for them, demands Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven District governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, answering some with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, there is no such thing in the governments of the governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"also in Schwaben, women are not housed alone," says Karl-Heinz Meyer, Pressesprecher of the government. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Oberbayern, Lower and Mittelfranks there are in some common areas of floors or own homes only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the" "rights of women and gender equality" "in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it is said:" it is very important that men and women will be separated. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"lack of privacy or will be taken together for men and women, it may come to - continual violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"the laundry rooms should be separated and readily available for women, stands in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel of this protection, you can read in the contention which it gives to the house in Munich."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of foreign ones"?</seg>
<seg id="2">"it was a gesture, which ended up a crisis."</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight month long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish backlers in the golese Hall of St. Petersburg's palace at the reception, I can not repel the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smiles had a malignant, and it was hardly radiated heat, even for its long-term conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but can even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have heard so would never happen anything worse."</seg>
<seg id="11">To me the enthusiasm seemed to be the opposite to me.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin radiant, sustainable bolle showed that the President of Russia had nothing forgotten."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his submissions: the detoning of a Russian campaign on the Syrian border with Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was wanders burned.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to please Russia in his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The failure was even greater because it was committed by a alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">"the vetrack again to rebuild is difficult, if not even impossible."</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the public-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"once seemed, the Turks seemed to blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious trials were the accusations of leading officials that Erdogan's own family from illegal oil stores in Syria would have benefited from the so-called Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology of President Erdogan who he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the benefits of a cease-fire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan requires all the friends which he can get after he contained nearly his amad last month at a failed coup.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions made Turkey hit hard - especially on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">Travel companies and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">You count on a late seasonal onslaught in the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week projected the state remote to see fruits and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish agrarian imported goods will be allowed."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in vedemosti worded it as:" "tourists there for long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West as it was a response to the tried to take power over a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the ongoing Groll come across the snail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike to move out of the cool atmosphere and decrease the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian leader won a bonus in Ankara that he called for the sovereign government to support the elected government organs."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is well-noted for Moscow, a matter of course, which itself changes a deeper fear of regimechange."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this glowing palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portray it as an analyst once described," Alliance of outer side "": two countries that contravene themselves from the West and now ignite themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two still."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the largest difference in Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposing views."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be signifying that after nearly three hours of first talks, both Presidents were told at the press conference, that they would not even take the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the president of Turkey comped it to question a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on how a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect discord, NATO member of Turkey collapsing the Russian martial jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state will at least once again talk."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"founded in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he made his conclusion at the prestigious State of Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the website of the Kremlin, it is said (in Russian) that he was later a protocol and chief executive manager of the government."</seg>
<seg id="10">"he said to Putin:" "thanks for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">"I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your work as heads of state, and controls the implementation of your instructions."</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov has asked to leave his posts and have recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time of one of the busiest Vladimir Putin's and works as he works for the Soviet intelligence service to KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>

<seg id="20">He currently knows no one.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official statement - that a man, who once was touted as a potentially president, would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - smote great scepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks on Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said," "It is true that I have asked you in early 2012 in a conversation I could almost say - complained about four years long."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidency management for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin former member of the Security Council of KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power in his power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once was believed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, since a third term Putin would violate against the constitution."</seg>

<seg id="3">"we talked with Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Verbandes in New York to find out how to walk with armed robbers on distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind, this video will show you how you revolve for your robber."</seg>
<seg id="5">"when one crosses yourself from behind, then you should turn off as a check, so that you can see your attacker and move out of the touch," "says Mizrachi."</seg>
<seg id="6">Grab the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free elbows to face.</seg>
<seg id="7">"then hit him with your knee in the bar and shoot, while the attacker is collapsed before pain, the weapon from his hands. hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while they set the weapon on it."</seg>
<seg id="8">"at attackers, which approach itself from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the touch line, grab the weapon and rotate them so that the attacker may not shoot."</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright schy for a guide to his tongue on the dirty places of Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and woreflex a serious test - by leased some of the dirty and ekelest places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the presenter and traveler Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk picked up his course on a Euro-Schein, a railing on the Piccadilly Circus, a sink knob, as well as a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of its immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before picking each object, he used a luminometer to show itself and to show us what he will let."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filtered under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought, the rinsing knob has been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact they are in a kitchen sinle more bad bacteria."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with physicians and medical specialists about the promotion of bowel bacteria as well as his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left that he stretched out more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of its intestines by travelling through the world and ate peculiar as well as wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to railway stations to a flush of toilets, the task presented its immune system definitely under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"he told the film:" already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns, and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms, and sludwater. "</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the only thing he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial line showed a lumineter number of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared with this, the Lumineter number is more fresh or less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to cut off after their luminant figure was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio manufactured the Reisefilm" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the bacterial number in different locations like the bathroom."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," "This comes the worst thing I have been in a toilet, near."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing bad than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"I will not touch here, because it is here indoors."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company stadowed Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D, to support the promotion of bowel bacteria and the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we really wanted to offer the consumer something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led crazy brainstormings that ended with that we told "Lass us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">Claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">"also, I think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!"</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the Director of the film, added:" let me tell me so - I would have tasted my respect for Ian when he would have relieved some of things that I have relied to him, like the ekelective Russian toilet that is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things in which it was simpler to bring Ian to touch it and others, where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">Glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by 2015, 84 percent of all respondents carried out in 2015, in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said they are at least occasionally used products, which included lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="24">Manches also has unearthed and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">"and with some points - in the unequal treatment of thought, for example - does the question arises: what does this actually have to do with certainty and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, say de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror."</seg>

<seg id="2">Lonely men middle-age love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before making a comment to oversaw it under the pseudonym of non-aging men with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the disparities of sound plates did not want to be seen on a boom in millennials who want to welcome the novelty of physical objects but attributed to Midlife-nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are all foresight at the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a horror by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older records reserve their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But vote the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on television, I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and wild, before I steal, my hands hold and something certain of the saying," "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let's take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Sohos is slowly involved in his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent salesmen were located - there are still a handful of fantastic records."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to beg the camera for the next part where I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to cherish their age and mind by observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55 which I use of Sister Ray (Datenreport: two young women, three men aged men) to the Reckless Records (Datenreport: eight men middle ages, a woman, probably about the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill the couple of hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, question I?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these sound plates, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I am not sent to it home), dress up the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he possesses a considerable number of albums and singles, the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford, when they had appeared and once again buy objects that he sold, when he was young and pleite."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late sixties, early 70ies which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things that I probably was too young to buy it me," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who are buying the boards are more introverted and would like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my push.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers that he meets to apply the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the medium, people who have heard about the comeback and set yourself to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the discussions that I have led, people generally have been emptied in order in 1998 or in 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to get back their records again," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of the turntable of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">"it takes only a few seconds in a shop like phonica, in order to recognize that there is a soothing community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the non-contact payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record-fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of familiar silplattends, of objects, the happy Jugenderinnings."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material goods than a kind of comfort," "says WEZ."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is true with me as collectors so and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to employ spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" flutes a staff of a record stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month, they have not yet heard."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% possess a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, do not have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, while at a stack of Bossa Nova Compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (Datencount: three men middle-aged), has noticed a" trophy "of the Revivals."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came just recently here and said," I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead Shplate, so I can put them into the shelf, "" he says. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a great percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more manufacturers, less musictual."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people, who say," I have no record player. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not elderly, who are not slow to come."</seg>
<seg id="44">"stopover, which has dedicated to the record of sound nearly a whole floor, has a little audience when I go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenager and women middle age."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the prestanding stores - Wild Beasts neurosizers and sextucked pop, instead of experimental jazz, out of the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks quite lonely, but nave mental traumas are hard to imagine if one stands next to someone 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs around in business for a few minutes and looks at the variance of the plates for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It is rather a shop hereditary as a big purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not earn a lot, so the collecting of records is not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or another way but the beauty of records is... it drives with a loved sigh sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a business, of which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I lay the semblance that jeans jeans hotspot, I observe a group of young teenager, grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter contemplate, to buy a Crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a blend of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody looks at it - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to put it."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"however, considering that every attraction for these items will mean more money for the industry and some customers can send in the depths of soils for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"there is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research inquiries made that the results of YouGov vote, they leave, at least in record business in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record companies that exist in reality, record business and in Online."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday tomorrow not with the bumble through records of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they avoid the rigid view of an uncanny, 30-year-old moderator, who over the shoulders rises nothing of the middle aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the singing has accompanied URSEL Kipp already her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher training she defeated the Fach of music, and now the 78-year-old sings in an seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing me - emotional and physically," "describes them."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a sample she feels balanced, cheerful and overall living, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by doing so, she does something good for her health and her mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Singen is equal to several perspectives, a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior League."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"due to regular meetings, seniors can build and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"they often solve social and family structures in the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience also made URSEL Kipp in her choir: to address and organize themselves on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together.</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be tiring in a positive sense means Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in doing so, seniors exercise a deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"whoever calls for his lungs regularly, also in everyday life not as fast from the Puste."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even if it comes to obtaining the sound of the voice at the age, Singen is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"on older people, Singen is often a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Association of Seniors-organizations."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations the common singing had a much higher significance, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observed that singing or hearing of songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through Liedtexte and particularly chanted tunes, the sick people deny itself in long recalled events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while singing, the head is also required to have a special achievement," Lenz explains. "</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time concentrate on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">"elderly people who live alone, exercise alone, do not only concentrate on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through the singing in the choir means Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows through the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show yourself, if I am long for something, I will be better and vigilant about me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start with the singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate, even if he says to have little talent, betrays lenz."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sings only - at 50 sinful people, who hears it, when a note goes to it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of the suitable offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"sings someone from the acquaintances in a senior enchyma, one can simply connect."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Who wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you do not have access to the internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask for help with the Internet site."</seg>
<seg id="35">"who desire to sing should definitely join in a choir, slant Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is doing a soul well and has a bit of liberating - this applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="28">"the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds on constraints of more than ten years ago, as a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, faced with the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation of occupation in Iraq and had little time on it to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>

<seg id="3">"five gates in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said they could not remember that ever done."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." "she said."</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, they know that the Americans are at 4-0 in the olympic competition, and are equalled in their group with the Britons in the first place, which after its 2-0 victory against Japan."</seg>
<seg id="7">The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first lap.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarter-final, the game will decide which of the two within their group from six teams will reach the first and second place."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first place will take a little longer out of the way that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game may go on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising deal by their success story, four years after they landed at the last London games on the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time in three years with a hockey sleeping in hands (their two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became a national team of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">"they missed the Olympiad in 2008, as it could not qualify for the Kader."</seg>

<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the work in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have the rudder completely snatch.</seg>
<seg id="19">"on Thursday evening, Bam opened the doorstep in the first half of the game with a return from the Middle East."</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and kept the play of 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took their hands into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she accomplished a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the center and swallowed the ball into the gate around the Americans to get a 2-0 guide."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last district.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the keepers of the USA, Jackie Briggs, which had previously had a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position" said Parnham, but how good will depend on the end of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro are consistent and inescapable, a quick season between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the olympic torch itself is a burning stoma, which is passed from wristening to the swimmers to the triathlete for the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can not switch off the TV to read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue shop, without hearing over Simone Biles, Katie Leisy or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and a woman's warm with dimples, could possibly have been sent under this known name which would be sent to Prime Time, provided by sponsors and well-being-TV advertising if he would be a swimmer, turner or even fencer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in the olympic trampoline for gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame not illuminated every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not universally accepted: airbrush, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breastswimming and may reign over for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I might make modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charme of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline has been an Olympic Event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years it was so sparsely noticed that many that I had asked, did not know that it is at all an Olympiasportart."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the US has sent athletes to competition, there has never been a medal in the trampoline and had made a athletes until the end of 2012."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians to share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Roshe MacLennon from Canada will defend her gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"jumping on the trampoline has some outsider charme, partly because it sounds suitable for the unresolved ear for a clownschool than that sounds for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in this place I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a born enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of its never-end clouds - but also the Grazie of the turnaround and diving, the two sports that unites it essentially. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means so much as" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"aspiring winner jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling moves (turning, headers and saltos) before they land at the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"they are evaluated according to the official Olympiad after execution, degree of difficulty and" "flight time". ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"two-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women are compete in Rio against each other."</seg>

<seg id="27">"they do not only hunt the ornamental or the curtailwall, but also in the television transmission: the world or the Olympiarism."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the targeted pursuit is posh, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I think even when looking at these games as something tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">"of this, the trampoline offers a respite."</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">Moving forward is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she insane, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is just as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>

<seg id="4">Witnesses say that seventy protesters were killed during clashes with the police when clashes were killed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to break up?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in the past few months, protests against the government fought the country and spread out more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was unmerciful to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Proclaimed that policemen were shot at tens of unarmed demonstrators and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"moving around the protests, which probably are from the last or beginning of this year, show like security professionals young people with staves, while they were forced to make a hand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Office for Human Rights now requires a thorough examination.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror across the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded at the respectable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuters in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but an example for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country was limited, with dissidents effective for silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile, or sent into prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness."</seg>
<seg id="21">But this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," "said Zeyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopian."</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous ailments that cover everything from the ground-use to the stranglehold with respect to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a far provisional election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, the tensions rising along the border with Eritrea; a battle for this timid, controversial line, called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fear that separatists are afraid of the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden which in recent years have been more or less forced to benefit the turbulence and arming themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of contraction after years of prior to executions under the surface explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, very many Ethiopians have been able to communicate via social media, as cheap smartphones were more and more frequent and improved the internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government doesn't get access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially for protests, do many people still communicate via Internet proxies which conceal where they are staying."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave that they gathered themselves so too protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia, mostly Christian floods, in politics and the economy, while they are exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and live in flat-areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing straight.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests found in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, in the secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on a non-publicized disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was seen as a tactical cooperative, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analysts say that it was particularly misused to perceive early signs of discontent and to use special officers, to handle opponents and make them inharmful."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the present regime is lacking in this basic regime," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected from relatively unseen reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of the north of Ethiopian, Mr. Hailemariam from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security-controlled safety services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time Ethiopia was experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of elections were protested, according to the figures of analyst, were seemingly fuelled by the government and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raids many protesters were killed, even if it were less than in the last months and these days of unrest were relatively fast over."</seg>
<seg id="52">"Ethiopian Ethiopians leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuters, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty-fighting poverty."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal abnormalities of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protest in Gondar, a amharan city, from Tigray-shops and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more and more experienced in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst said that protests the US and other Western allies bring in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronym about the neighbouring Somalia, even if it's recently raised that it has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West will clearly support democracy, he doesn't want his ally collapsed in an already volatile territory."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin gratwalk."</seg>

<seg id="3">This clarifying clarifying new questions about the skills of the Presidential candidates of the Republican to whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandable to the American public.</seg>

<seg id="5">"after spending the hint at an election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump went back to the claim on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really did not intended to indicate the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump, he was just a sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Tweet was opposite to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely seriously."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative radiomodator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help weaken the statement slightly, he reminded him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him, the Republican presidential elections can't know anything about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism shattered on Mr. Trump while he tries to draw the focus of his campaign because of random transformations to the economic situation.</seg>

<seg id="14">"at the end of July he drew strong criticism of himself, when he said, the Russians should crack Mrs. Clinton Emails, however he later stated" Natural, "I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back home.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of its methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans as they arrive, and then possibly" clarify "depending on how the reaction falls." "Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I also believe, he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>

<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a tour with great lead in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump generally tries to apologize for his provocative statements, he frequently accused his critics to distort his statements or to understand his humor."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he is strengthened in the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherkes have brought his loyal co-powers to stand in the uncomfortable situation regardless of how provocative his statements may also be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the umps of prominent intercessors, had great trouble to defend the candidates in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" "Mr. Giuliani said he was asked to the correctness of Mr. Trumps, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State."</seg>

<seg id="25">"most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, served by the Mrs. Clinton as an external ministerial, it ISIS allowed to spread out the situation in the Middle East corrosive under control."</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest cyclist is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-sharks usually occur only in winter to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This hai was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the Sanna's research vessel.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to the present day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland has only been born with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely swims the Greenland-shark at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is estimated at an average of just 1.220 meters."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it arrives, the five metre long animal accelerates at 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Robbe with this maximum speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">But that of longitudinal-shaped lifestyle is to be a patchy for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the Copenhagen University and his colleagues report in the journal" Science "at any rate from a Greenland who could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scheupper from the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this life-span which means for vertebrates a world record. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"indeed, the evolutionary biologist already assumed that Greenland become a stone-old stone."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacking the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland are difficult to watch, eventually they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the thin coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water-temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive on the surface in winter only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">"on the lifestyle of Greenland, researchers know accordingly little."</seg>
<seg id="17">"their time pentpentine measures it, when they had six animals with a transmitter, and they had six animals with a transmitter."</seg>
<seg id="18">"prey these Haie still: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remnants of a Robbe, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">"possibly they hunt sleepy animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice-sea, looking carcasses, which are from higher water layers to bottom."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now studied 28 Greenland-hay, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as a stopper from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502 centimeters is measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of animals, they analyzed with the carbon-14 method the lens of sharks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eyelash arises already before the birth of sharks, which are contained in it later no longer."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth should therefore lie in the atmosphere after the early 1960s, as nuclear weapons trying to drag bigger amounts of this radioactive carbon dioxide into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in that with 220 centimeters of the third tier, the Linsenkers disintegrating a low excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all major Greenland-hay had normal carbon-14 amounts, which arises from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-clock showed a 493 centimeters long Greenland for a 493 centimeters long Greenland an age of 335 years, while the record-shark with 502 centimeters is even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-females can only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers could assign the length to an age."</seg>
<seg id="31">"as one of the animals with 392 centimeters is probably at the brink of sex-ripe and his age with 156 years was determined, Greenland with the multiplication obviously can be at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this should be for vertebrates at present around the world.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"also the previous record-holder, a 211 year old Greenland-wal, in whose bacon the neck a 120 years old Harpounding was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there are often on asparagus."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and althless slow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly big."</seg>
<seg id="38">"the volume is growing much faster than its surface, through which the animal tempered heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram is therefore much larger than with a grams of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on getting as many descendants as possible," explains the evolution of evolution. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"however, a very big animal should rather invest its resources in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the passenger Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a Hinder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap to close the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton trying to retire.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man where they stayed when they saw potential in the villi that has now unfolded.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was most likely to be inhabitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, the NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms, which are similar to those of climate research."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether Venus with its hot, waterproof surface and CO2-dense atmosphere was once recorded."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow orbit of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, the latest simulation points to that Venus could have had a thin, erdsimilar atmosphere and slowly moved on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminates the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet was probably more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and to be more quickly blackout."</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also profited from a Sun which was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS modelling simulation, the slow revolutions of the Venus transduced their daily side of the sun almost two months," "GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio" stated in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a rainbow in order to shield the surface from a large part of the sun heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the result is average temperatures, which are a few degrees cooler than that of the earth today."</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a story of Venus that is similar to evolution that had previously suspected of planetary research.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was probably habitable, Venus was exposed in the course of several billion years --zuy much heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">"their oceans evaporated, and its water vapor was blown away by the ultra-violet light."</seg>

<seg id="2">Compressing malware are currently targeted companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of the malware-defense experts Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies were at least once, in the past twelve months at least once, partially several times a attack with blackmaser software."</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany nearly 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware extortion.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims paid willingly the solvent requested by the perpetrators to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialised in their blackmaser software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potentially expirate ransom is much higher than for private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a startling fast evolution of damage software," says Malwarebytes leader Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the Malwareprogrammes were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmailing software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">"first of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks occurred within the last months, was startling quickly."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it searches for unlong changed files such as Wordcloud, Excel- or database files as well as archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the ransomware and deletes the originality.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the demands of the blackmaser.</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the end-key code to the files, the victims need money - mostly in the form of the Cryptogen Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where private users are using the personal photo database in the game, it is about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is still tackled."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware strikes."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the German firms concerned by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to break completely under way of operation, in a case humans were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, many hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients may be threatened by the loss of hospitals."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say to the victims always: pays not, you only promotes the problem," "explains Kleczynski."</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data back again."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of offenders in the face of a standstill."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know that and try to establish a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure obtained the commercial space and get the contact with blackmailers and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to establish a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain to their victims by chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, direct access-accessible support websites or decode free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and will be revising individuals after payments of a few hundred euros, companies need to pay partly hard and five digits figures to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware-blackmail, the hacker will always be professional and share the work, explains the security expert Chester Wisniewski of Antivirus-provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware circa within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"more likely, it is that it is about three or four people."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening you get eternally awake, at night you are awake for hours, the morning is already far before the wake-up ring no more of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, you are with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults are sleeping disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently restful."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep in sleep?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleeping disorders, and there are many causes underlying them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Wear, Board member of the German Society for Sleepages and Sleeping Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what you understand, but is the Insomnie, so an input and sleepy disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"right now, many people feel as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, Board member in the German domestic medical association with practice in the Anglo-Saxon Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleeping disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind it can be organic, mental or maladjusted factors, but also medicines."</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the sleeping expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early waking up is especially frequent during depression," says Wee. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors would like to take one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">"if for example has a slipped disk, it can be bad, guarded every two to three hours and starts to greet you about everyday problems and indulge, weeds are an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you use sleeping disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who is not well versed over a period of one month at least three nights per week, and the day is compromised, should go to the doctor, betrays Wee."</seg>
<seg id="19">"impairment can look very different: it is downcast, tired, unexhausted, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has moods or physical discomfort such as stomach or headaches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to relieve the sleeping disorder, it is important to find their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the treatment options apply to other behavioral patterns, a cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - classic sleeping-coated tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is hardly possible in Germany with low-rainfall, Prof. Ingo Fiber, leader of the interdisciplinary and medical center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"that is why you should first turn in sleeping problems at the dental clinic, betrays Wee."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who was to sleep in the bedlab, and what happens there?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for an examination in the sleeping laboratory, medical device, for example with snoring with respiratory disorders, in disease-fatigue or if one does not find the cause of a sleepy disorder, Fiber."</seg>
<seg id="27">You do not need to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a lunch," "says Fiber."</seg>
<seg id="30">After bonding you go to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in addition to the electrodes in the body, one is wearing a nose-belt, a chest strap and a mitter at the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera stands at the ceiling to the bedtime."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can I get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which one can put for a better sleep.</seg>

<seg id="8">"after June 22nd the rooms were vacated on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, patrolling the police with 30 to 40 officials and three teams in front of the place, spersed parts of the street and kept visitors from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>

<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house-projects there are elementary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main attraction of many inhabitants: Kerstin Newgebauer, who lived in Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who have three children here, above all are generalized by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house-projects they share the care of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>

<seg id="20">"at the same time, the district of the last few years has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and Legberliners from all over the world: with them, the inhabitants of the GDR and former home occupied their Kiev."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also noticeable in the rents, which since 2009 has risen by nearly 60 percent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes it on worshipped slices or freshly painted facades that were beamed with color beutler.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year as often along with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"a reason why not all neighbours can see this as a problem, may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes like the body of the body are according to statistics almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>

<seg id="6">"she sees itself as a contact person for all players: refugees, working group refugees, administration, authorities and anyone else to mitigate."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Regine customer from the work group indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the rushing Wolluschsau, which has especially a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">Some - less spotting than rather on the multitude of specific tasks - meant as the management wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he was sought for a administration with a talent for languages and people, associated with many years of experience in the field of social work, just an experienced Wollusksau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organisation that work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been with it for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 per cent place for the period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle Ehr- and full-time actors are supported. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small issues, organizational, human and understanding problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the washing road</seg>
<seg id="17">"for some time, it has been recognized for some time to find apartments for the connection of connection, which have been acknowledged."</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must accomodate the refugees in their own or rented dormitories.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the cost of building, rent or renovations of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the property for the Commune and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his home.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration finds no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, don't have to rely on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, communities must be visited as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so, soon new containers will be set up in the washing road."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, the Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a solid base, it is an internship, training places, school courts, one-euro jobs and helpless activities for refugees and migrants that have to be found or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help homework, do charitable work - and this motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community is leading to a positive influence.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day need a fixed structure, say deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a lack of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so, you need offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So you also jump to the management and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome in Germany and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"you have to explain the refugees that it just takes and they can control the time in a sense, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who will eventually develop the feeling, he could not help in Urbach, do not work, and be unselfish, who will never be integrated."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority may be motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"however, there is also a customer that says honestly," people in which nothing is going on. "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: have the two after the recent incidents fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine says clearly, "" what mania may be called naïve "." a Restrisiko can and doesn't want to exclude them. "</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitized is the helpers but already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks will bring them completely into discall.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, main - and volunteers must keep on site and in the region according to activities."</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always in the background that soon a new shock of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach soon.</seg>
<seg id="57">Germany needs a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer.</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to place it helpers on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not yet arrived, where we would like to", "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine customer also makes it clear that Urbacher are already in exuberant, so that the people are functioning properly so far."</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mostly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, one should help them both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated there is no simple answers.</seg>
