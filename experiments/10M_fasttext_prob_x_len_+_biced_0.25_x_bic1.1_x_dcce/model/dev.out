Obama is listening to Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as by Teheran &apos;s destabili@@ zing action in the Middle East .
&quot; in this meeting , however , it is also meant to discuss the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been stra@@ ined for years .
Washington has critic@@ ised the state @-@ of @-@ the ceas@@ e@@ fire of Israel and casts a profound desire in the peace process .
&quot; through the dec@@ ency promoted by Obama to make the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship of the two has deterior@@ ated further . &quot;
&quot; in March , Netanyahu had held a controversial comm@@ u to the invitation of the Republi@@ can Congress to vali@@ date partly as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had marked this decision concerning the election period in Israel . &quot;
in a call is Professor to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ annon &apos;s represented with a somewhat timi@@ d voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would come to his house .
&quot; he &apos;s important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still alive and probably excited is , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , officials found the bodies of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was attached to a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I loved it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by he &apos;s Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that he was in two online tracks for the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland , Mississippi , signed 300 miles to school grounds , where according to the police , he has killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door leading to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ er@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he had made the fatal notation at some time afterwards .
by the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took life when the police took him shelter .
&quot; one day after the fir@@ ing at the university , the students and faculty themselves forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still trying to get a picture of what &apos;s motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators in both ends of the state , as well as that , what students and collaborators , who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or a criminal pre @-@ story . &quot;
&quot; he himself had he written himself written in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both set up in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty are 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some limitations to problematic behaviour . &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , he &apos;s he said , he also seemed a bit excited and ed@@ gy , &quot; &quot; as if something had been wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb tells him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
he had previously asked the Delta State University for alarm for health reasons and said that he had some health problem .
this year he has only two online @-@ courses .
&quot; recent changes in the Employment Policy of the University are important that the promotion , for whom he had worked so hard for him to present no guarantee for an automatic way to a task as Assistant Assistant . &quot;
&quot; father President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs presentation . &quot;
these are questions which he could not be able to answer .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs Track , when he returns to Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as import . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , he represented himself with an .@@ 38 cali@@ ber p@@ istol in the back@@ yard of a house approximately a mile south of his parents @-@ house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , told Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still going on a tour .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
he grew up in the area .
&quot; he began his work in 2009 at the University , who has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught Ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
he graduated in the spring in Ped@@ ago@@ gy .
it is one of the many years of friendship that called him intelligent and charis@@ matic and funny .
&quot; Carla H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when they met through joint friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool senior guy who tried to teach some guitar playing . &quot;
he was then the woman &apos;s warm .
&quot; all girls melting away when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson Pre@@ city of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the call , he said , &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife &quot; , &quot; but there was no honour from a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the back@@ bone house , that borders to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , &quot; they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; it was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he was never met , but due to his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that he was interested in music and playing blues . &quot;
he &apos;s thunder@@ ings as he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail three years ago both played on a summer year .
later they played one or two gigs .
&quot; o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings about her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse used for different companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes entertaining Co@@ ordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak b@@ anded bar near Gau@@ tier , told that he &apos;s represented and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night of September 5 , after he had ended his guitar accordion and harmon@@ ic@@ ar@@ ism before a serious audience . &quot;
there was no sign of anything that was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clo@@ wning and bl@@ ur@@ ry together .
I mean they had both a good sense for jo@@ kes .
&quot; Schmidt , the t@@ ote professor , headed the first semester program and specialized on American natives and the colonial history , &quot; Don All@@ an Mitchell , an English @-@ professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his frat@@ ernity and the Stu@@ dents committee .
&quot; the Cle@@ veland performed at the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland took about 900 people , including lec@@ tur@@ ers , employees , students and members of the municipality on a candle lev@@ ue . &quot;

the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .

&quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans were contribut@@ ors to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that he told the emergency call , after he signed Schmidt , and that lamb was referred to as his wife , but there was no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;

the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also notable for personal reasons .

UN Secretary not says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; ban K@@ i @-@ Moon , Secretary General of B@@ an K@@ i @-@ Moon , said its response to Russia &apos;s strengthened military support for Syria : &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of conflict ; and more weapons will wor@@ sen the violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN Secretary is calling for all parties , including the UN Security Council , to unite and integr@@ ative negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; a press conference held on Wednesday that he is planning to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member countries of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the end of the Council meeting at the Annual General Assembly , in order to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he regre@@ ts that the adjustment in the Council and within the Syrian people and of the regional powers &quot; &quot; render this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot;
&quot; she called on the five constant members to show up the same solidarity and unity at tackling the crisis in Syria , which proved to be proved in the achievement of nuclear De@@ als with Iran . &quot;
8 re@@ frac@@ tures that show that Donald Tr@@ ump must take seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have prevented him as a joke .
and some waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys , it has ( yet ) not work . &quot;
ten of the last eleven national surveys Donald Tr@@ ump reported in the double @-@ digit range and some begin to ask themselves seriously what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the property .
of course it is too early in the election period .
none claimed that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ise that at that time in 2011 Rick &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Herman C@@ ain , none of them won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why they have to fight in a general election .
&quot; but outside groups , like Je@@ b Bush &apos;s Super PAC and the conservative daily group Club for Human Growth now , Tr@@ umps persist and begin to let their dollar flow in order to pl@@ unge it . &quot;
here are some current survey values that suggest that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l isn &apos;t just a temporary phase :
lac@@ ri@@ bilities levels have been directed by 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans see the Real Estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l positively . &quot;
by the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
&quot; now , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
about three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep themselves in early states .
a Quin@@ n pi@@ ac @-@ vote in Iowa has found last week that 60 percent of Re@@ public@@ ans have a good idea of dump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c last week , 67 percent of Re@@ public@@ ans said , they would be either &apos; thrilled &apos; or &apos; content if Tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of them say , they would be &quot; angry &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son is able to say about the same enthusiasm like Tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent ) , they would be &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next in the matter of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand 47 percent of the republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite establishment , the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Re@@ public@@ ans sees m@@ umps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the Re@@ public@@ ans believe that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l believe the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number applies in the first Pre @-@ State of the State , the State of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of Re@@ public@@ ans believe that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ op@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; yet 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively run his office , and nearly six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament is not into the White House p@@ asse , so ABC / post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; if she expose her scholar@@ ship , Republi@@ can voters Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked to be asked who most likely won the GO@@ P @-@ nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c from last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump will be the best bet . &quot;
that &apos;s a change since the time when four out of ten will put their money back to Je@@ b Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P @-@ voters does not have the clear@@ est cryst@@ all@@ ball in the past .
at that point in the last cycle four out of ten public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would gain the nom@@ ination opposite only 28 % for the final candidate in Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless it shows that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voting le @-@ m@@ umps can be viewed as plau@@ sible .
&quot; even when the re@@ public@@ ans have gathered for another Candi@@ date , Tr@@ ump will go almost everybody . &quot;
some experts point out that the sh@@ atter@@ ing field is likely to contribute to a m@@ umps leadership during the anti @-@ trace output to more than a dozen other candidates diff@@ use .
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between the dump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump got more support . &quot;
&quot; he took advantage of C@@ early Fior@@ ina 13 points lead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , prior to Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ ze and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who is holding it ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneurs with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scarce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says they have formed their opinions .
&quot; a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday showed that just slightly more than half the vot@@ er , the Tr@@ ump will support , say that they have awarded their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , a lot has to happen to change that , and no one can truly say , never change the opinion . &quot;
&quot; 46 percent said they leave the door open , in order to change to other candidates . &quot;
&quot; however , Tr@@ umps strongest competition in the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as frequent for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they are in agreement with Tr@@ ump upon emigr@@ ation .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign , Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign , called immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; &quot; was the immigration and ful@@ crum in the public discourse to 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expul@@ sion of the Tr@@ ump of decisive Hisp@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and the re @-@ orient@@ ations will damage .
&quot; however , following the new ABC / post pol@@ l of Monday six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they are in agreement with Tr@@ ump in issues of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump will appear to be done . &quot;
the frustration of the government climbed up on new peak .
&quot; at Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , more than half of the support of republi@@ can voters , especially its out@@ sider status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey conducted by ABC / post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry with Washington .
&quot; a survey of D@@ es Mo@@ ines register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks shows that three out from four Iowa Re@@ public@@ ans to be frustrated with 54 per cent &quot; &quot; and 21 percent &quot; &quot; aw@@ fully upset . &quot;

&quot; in the street it costs a square meter of a roof @-@ roof , in the average of 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is naturally limited , so it is in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which particular layers a square meter is at the most cost .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top @-@ places , one at the price is as Pe@@ an@@ uts before . &quot;

Champions League : Bayern @-@ Dream Award thanks to Müller and Go@@ i@@ dol
doubt Tor@@ r@@ cher in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has simply a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller ar@@ ra@@ ined FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus - then ran .
a sovereign in the Champions League season .
&quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e have designated the FC Bayern in Hex@@ en@@ kes@@ sel of Piraeus , a dream start into the &quot; mission Milan . &quot; &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her launch event in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to D &apos;s Double @-@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth show victory in series should be the first step towards the finale on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally take the release of the Hen@@ kel@@ o to Munich . &quot;
Müller received his first hit in the Champions League for the Anglo @-@ guidance Mi@@ ght of the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto who were able to make a life as a stro@@ lling on the world &apos;s life .
&quot; we won &apos;t appreciate it , &quot; had promised Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ame in front of the game at the Car@@ av@@ k@@ aki Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Mün@@ chner was speaking . &quot;
&quot; they showed a concentrated and committed idea , without shine . &quot;
&quot; Piraeus had won his latest six home@@ work in the Royal Class , among them against popular clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; although Bavaria , in seven European ac@@ ups were defeated with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went bol@@ dened , with their more aggressive efforts , but often too resour@@ ce@@ ful . &quot;
these attacks were introduced too often by the shift on lef@@ th@@ ens Douglas Costa Rica that were rarely crossed by the previous strong Omar Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right side than his flan@@ k proposed from the right half board in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion had the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Le@@ af@@ ov@@ sky .
&quot; first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms rant of Brown the head@@ ball of Poland hit by the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then , by direct delivery , the Tor@@ wart Roberto with the knee par@@ ted ( 3@@ 5th ) . &quot;
&quot; although Bavaria moved up from the dominant game , Pi@@ re@@ aus has been able to con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous con@@ i@@ stick . &quot;

&quot; also at the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was decided against him , when he brought King@@ ley Com@@ an for the an@@ la@@ wed Le@@ wand@@ or@@ ov@@ sky ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ tz@@ e arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and did take 13 minutes later everything clearly , via El@@ f@@ ﬁ@@ nd Müller another dr@@ on . &quot;

&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , therefore , is not only the lungs , but also the teeth , that lies near a sky@@ line of persons . &quot;
the good news : this risk is quick .
smokers have a clearly elevated risk to lose their teeth early .
&quot; this is a long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees by the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smokers , smoking lies the risk losing their teeth early , in order to lose the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3,@@ 6 times higher . &quot;
the scientists had watched over 23.@@ 300 participants .
&quot; major causes for tooth failure are tooth decay and inflammation of the tooth , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ RE@@ E . &quot;
for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis is smoking a risk factor but stress the authors .
the connection between smoking and dental loss may therefore go back on common g@@ ums g@@ ums with smokers .
not clarified is how much smoking also increases the risk for tooth decay .
&quot; people who heard with smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
&quot; it could only last ten years until the threat to the level of non @-@ smokers , &quot; explained Thomas Diet@@ rich at the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one need to convince humans to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; said leaders &quot; H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; smoking is shortened the lifetime . &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and vessel and leads to our expertise also to a good dental health until the high age .
&quot; in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population is affected by dental c@@ ess@@ ness between 65 and 74 years , sharing the DI@@ W e . &quot;
earlier studies have already noted that smoking is the risk of early tooth failure .
the new long @-@ term study bri@@ ghten the findings .
archae@@ ologists meet Köl@@ ner Rhein@@ u@@ fer on Res@@ te from the period

&quot; from text documents had already been known , that at the point in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have granted a church , explained Tri@@ er . &quot;
&quot; alongside the remains of the fortress and the cherry , a cemetery with some 350 graves had been discovered , which probably belonged to the church . &quot;

&quot; to improve the dispute over the planned transatlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system . &quot;
the disputed private sc@@ aff@@ ections for disputes between companies and states should therefore be solved by a more transparent system which corresponds significantly in his functioning clearly more traditional dishes .

&quot; to date , the procedures involved in each other have agreed to refer@@ ee , a spru@@ ce against their judg@@ ments , there was no objection to the proceedings . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of recent months , it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in relation to fairness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , they want to work according to their own information on an International Investment Tribunal . &quot;
there could also be clarified in the example there may be disputes between Chinese companies and the EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbitration proceeding mainly required of large @-@ wage @-@ state arbitration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) are considered one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbitr@@ al tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel , the tax exemp@@ tion bur@@ dens the tax@@ payers , to balance national laws or to a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in first comments , anti @-@ TTIP organizations like Camp@@ act are considered to be insufficient in the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot;
critic@@ ises the fact that they are not supposed to apply for the free trade agreement ( CE@@ TA ) for the already negotiated trade agreement ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) signed the plans on the other hand as a great progress .
&quot; the Commission considered at the reform essential points , the Federal Minister of Sig@@ mar Gabriel studied in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbitration may be from the table .
also the French government greeted the plans of Malm@@ ström .
&quot; the European Union @-@ association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against , the pi@@ ge@@ es of the economy , by too many new rules . &quot;
particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be disadvantaged in it .
&quot; when the discussions about the free trade agreement ( Transatlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) , the Transatlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership are still unclear . &quot;
the negotiations have been underway since the middle of 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is no longer durable .

Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ l &apos;s debut in the Prime Minister for the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ l &apos;s debut on the prime minister of the Prime Minister with excitement is expected .
the new Labour president Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n aims to make his debut in the Prime Minister for the first time and create with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to the first of his six given question shortly after lunch and his performance from the media is likely to be checked by the media and the Labour MEPs .
he called for less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could transfer some meetings to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ hav@@ n &apos;s guidance , for it comes to his appointment as a member of the shadow of wireless and following his speech at the TU@@ C yearly meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Labor Party decision to be prov@@ oked during a memorial to the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence to commemor@@ ate criticism from a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the center of several title @-@ page stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ l &apos;s decision to not sing the national an@@ them has drawn attention to itself
&quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had granted &quot; &quot; the respectable silence &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ &apos;s Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two News@@ night program , he has advised the Labour leader to sing the National An@@ them , regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow @-@ ministers have refused to serve Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns excell@@ ently , and they were called to differences in business , defense and foreign affairs , while less than one @-@ sixth of the parliamentary party was originally supporting him as leaders . &quot;
the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ ch says that political differences also st@@ ack@@ able within the Labour Party and to Mr Cor@@ by@@ &apos;s remarks about the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference to tie Labour changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
&quot; Mr Smith , the shadow of working and pensions , that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only going against the government plans to cut the limit of 6@@ 000@@ ,000 to 23@@ ,000 pounds . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth president , who has David Cameron , since he has been a T@@ ory boss , over the last decade of the Disp@@ atch @-@ Box in the parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour president , who promised a different policy approach , says he &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has given him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP said that the Prime Minister from the Prime Minister is confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will refrain &quot; &quot; perc@@ ei@@ ghs &quot; &quot; and the quar@@ rel@@ ing with resistance and that he should concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle is being represented with the shadow of the Prime Minister if he is not participating - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally grasp the word , and that he was addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the sub@@ house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he was inter@@ cep@@ ted by politicians in the style of an &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ Theater &quot; , &quot; which is often linked to the Prime Minister . but a few years later he left that he failed . &quot;
&quot; as it was first sent on television first in 1990 , the question was regarded with the Prime Minister as a most important bar@@ ometer of the possession and his position in the House of Commons and his position among his parliament@@ arians , although critics have argued that they had become a caricature and than@@ king @-@ long reforms . &quot;

weigh about acceler@@ ating growth in the UK
&quot; the pound is volati@@ le for data that show a rise in wage growth of the UK . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was enhanced by the Geb@@ ot@@ s@@ target SA@@ BM@@ iller today . &quot;
between May and July the result of earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage had been the fastest and in@@ estim@@ ations at the time of a rate of interest .
&quot; the pounds rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro on 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % on 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the acquisition of the ri@@ vals AB In@@ Be@@ v was given .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and brands like Bud@@ ě@@ k , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry stocks were looking forward to encouraging messages from the competition for luxury goods and product range 3.@@ 9 % higher .
&quot; the latest sales figures hit all the expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry , got back growth again . &quot;
&quot; stocks of Gl@@ en@@ core grew by 5 % , after the mining industry said that he has taken 2.5 billion dollars through a share sale as part of its strategy of debt . &quot;
&quot; the shares of packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers on the index , and with a drop of 4.@@ 3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s has set his estimate for the company R@@ ating on &quot; sell . &quot; &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports rose by 3.@@ 1 % , after the sporting event had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the six months . &quot;
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages tend to je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze the expansion .
the CEO of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK @-@ workers could mean more buying power in the pockets of potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely that this merchant receives the higher labour costs in his company , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;

P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A @-@ poster gives Leban@@ on@@ ists on potato dum@@ b
potatoes or Bo@@ ar@@ cs ?
&quot; it goes both - and by the potato carp@@ enters , which has developed the Ol@@ den@@ burger Imb@@ ab@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the sp@@ lash &quot; &quot; kar@@ eba &quot; &quot; instead of a plac@@ ard of the P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat went together for a sk@@ e@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; the idea was a poster led by a P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the in@@ scription &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of &quot; &quot; that he had been seen on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , barbecue has been rotating in its shop which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is mul@@ ticultural for the stomach , &quot; &quot; Al@@ ha@@ y says . &quot;
the idea has now signed up with the Lebanese living in Munich at the patent office .
there she has been protected as a utility model according to the authority of the authority .
&quot; how much meat and how much potatoes of the sp@@ ie@@ der contains , Al@@ ha@@ y will therefore not reveal . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes together even better , &quot; he finds . &quot;
also with his customers the culinary delights are good on me .
met@@ cash provides ground speed campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - intru@@ sion
met@@ cash seeks to protect the Ig@@ A @-@ branch in front of an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground speed campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A @-@ retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , met@@ cash and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarket its relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A through mainstream media and marketing over social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A @-@ dealer and supplier ski@@ ps on board , with brands such as Eis@@ maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ un@@ borough , who is distributed in ordinary A stores and shop owner , who sell the cheapest tickets for the South Australian League . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to Win further details of its defense strategy on September 29th , when the wholesale distributor for food , alcohol and devices leads to its annual investor strategy . &quot;
&quot; it is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia accounts for nearly 30 percent of metal @-@ charging stations , and higher profits than met@@ a &apos;s Ig@@ A @-@ network in the East states . &quot;
&quot; shopping in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ e@@ tic provincial and Ig@@ A retailer come with a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland , more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared with about 14 percent in Western Australia . &quot;
&quot; analysts , as Morgan Stan@@ ley , said Al@@ di twelve months after opening his first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states and will take away all existing actors , but mostly an independent retailer of sales . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Ig@@ A @-@ retailer 360 $ million sales revenue per year and met@@ cash $ 250 million can be lost by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this prognosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened in the next year 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and will generate annual sales of € 500 million and 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss in food and gro@@ c@@ eries and in the quantities on met@@ a &apos;s high fixed amount , Met@@ cash could cost around 13 million dollars before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time Met@@ cash market shares in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan came out that Ig@@ A @-@ buys are the best . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley ackno@@ wle@@ dges that met@@ a &apos;s turnover in the food and food business by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2017 and 2.2 percent in 2017 and 2.2 percent in 2015 will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week reported the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , with a business@@ man in Melbourne , that met@@ cash probably will disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ cash refused to respond publicly to the comments from Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass last week has made contact .
&quot; IG@@ As &apos;s market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from met@@ a &apos;s food and food trade , which has approximately 1,@@ 200 Ig@@ A retailer , is represented by 43 percent of the operating debt management at the simultaneous pressure on turnover and margins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler , however , we@@ ars up and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to improve sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week to improve fresh produce by increasing fresh produce and to produce a better selection of private @-@ label food products . &quot;
&quot; met@@ a &apos;s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice states that the price adjustment and shop san@@ itation programs can be applied to El@@ an , and hopes that the wholes@@ aler in 2017 will return to profit growth for the first time in 2017 . &quot;
Than@@ asi Kok@@ o is supported by the president of the Australian tennis court Steve He@@ aly
than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis deserves more praise as criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ a@@ akis was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damages &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise from the President of the Australian tennis court Steve He@@ aly rather praise for his own behaviour .
&quot; Kok@@ te@@ y , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , is always described as &quot; special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with the in@@ famous dispute of K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualification game , shortly afterwards snor@@ ting had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee while Harrison ex@@ claimed : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have beat K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and I should hit the child . &quot;
&quot; last but while he was last seen how he struck a tennis r@@ ack@@ et , after a cr@@ amp@@ f came to a potential US @-@ open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ te@@ on@@ was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the individual behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup finals against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing , about which I en@@ vi@@ ed me rather , is the fact that after my view T@@ asi a little was drawn into the dispute . &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et , broken when he lost because of a cr@@ amp@@ ant in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has vom@@ ited a r@@ ack@@ et from Fr@@ ust , and I know T@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has been extremely well in the US Open , even under the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little bit too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very lumin@@ ous 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on he has never been a problem with other players , he is well trained ; he is well in shape , he is a very stable and perf@@ ected young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own merits . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to take K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os in important pre@@ decision , which begins on Friday , and he described the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right for all but he secur@@ es the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term solid element into the team . &quot;
&quot; firstly we wish that the team is completely concentrated on the competition and not all ro@@ un@@ ing around &#91; K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; and I believe that Nick has made very quickly the rise to what people like the Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray . he desc@@ ends into the eyes of the public , and he has tried to support him , we seek to give him the consequences of his action . some time outside the spotlight , in which he only think I think it is appropriate for the team and it is best for him . &quot;
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared an emergency closed the border to refugees
&quot; Hungary said the not@@ ary , p@@ aired the south@@ ward border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all strong trying to get illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos followed on the border , as hundreds of migrants would accum@@ ulate in a no @-@ ash@@ ore and Serbian officials with rebellion . &quot;
&quot; the people who have fled from violence , were ready for a unknown period in a landing at the road between the two check@@ points of the countries and built tents , and settled there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations climbed .
&quot; as a police helicopter about them flo@@ ated , sk@@ ating the migrants &quot; openings the border ! &quot; &quot; and sho@@ eing insul@@ ts against Hungarian government police forces . &quot;
some reported back to protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Ministers agreed that &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral harm .
&quot; in the coming days talks are held with Brussels and other countries , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence of the hung@@ arian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ nations block at a deb@@ ated meeting in Brussels failed to arrange a common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the Ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who escaped from Italy and Greece . they left their hope that after all - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be concluded that the EU states would pick up other 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put his hopes into an early action from Brussels or from its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , in two southern regions the authorities gave more authority to get out of the crisis , so they were able to obstruc@@ t streets and accelerate policies . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country also envis@@ age the construction of a bar@@ bed cross@@ fire along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after having ended up a fence at the Ser@@ b border .
&quot; C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison terms in the competition , the thor@@ n @-@ wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ tom@@ an for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban passed , however , ins@@ isted that most incoming business migrants are citizens who are searching for a better life and non @-@ war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strong contrary to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws that occurred at midnight in Hungary , crossing the crossing of the border or damaging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence , which established the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher ruler for do@@ omed men . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; said government @-@ speakers from Zol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the Southern town of Sz@@ eged . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .

elections @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clin@@ &apos;s lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a two @-@ digit lead over the democratic race at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins over it against the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the elections ( 58 per cent previously ) , while S@@ anders is second only , by 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he visits the presidential election , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is stated that candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clin@@ &apos;s supporters are more enduring than those of the other candidates in their choice .
&quot; since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders had achieved some profit . &quot;
&quot; Clinton keeps a big lead in women and moder@@ ates , but this le@@ aps have reduced . &quot;
&quot; their support in the males is significantly decreased , and S@@ anders is not able to return here with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ &apos;s &apos;s advantage for democratic voters under 50 years of age has van@@ ished , and they are now at the same height . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , still has a big advantage with the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton was before the two @-@ digit head start with the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now had a 5 point advantage over this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters of the country elections have been saying that , with enthusiasm , Clinton would support , if she would be nominated by the Party . &quot;
a quarter would support them with some predec@@ essors and another 15 percent would support them only because they have made the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ &apos;s &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are more bl@@ ended with those who are currently not support Clinton - only about a quarter would love them enthusias@@ tically .
&quot; in 48 percent of democratic voters of the pre@@ elections say , that Clinton helped with enthusiasm , say less republi@@ can voters do this by their top @-@ level data by Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; when Clin@@ &apos;s supporters is asked in an open question , why they want it is the right experience ( 16 % ) , followed by the belief that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
his joint link with Bill Clinton is also mentioned in connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and voting can also be quoted .
&quot; as the Vice President desig@@ nat@@ es a potential for the presidential fee to bear , 57 percent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - although one third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked for a pre@@ term , who would be their second choice for the party is bi@@ den at the top . &quot;
&quot; by Clin@@ ton &apos;s followers , they say more than half , that Bi@@ den would have their second choice far ahead of us . &quot;
&quot; decided by the nom@@ ination of the Democrats decided not to stand for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ton lead to S@@ anders , from 20 points in competition with bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five hundred percent of democratic voters have seen Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win a vote , but this number of 78 per cent in the last month has declined . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second when this measure , but the percentage of you looking at it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , you call for democratic voters issues about the voting . &quot;
similarly as in the last month not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate for such voters of the elections as unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some important characteristics with voters of the elections of their party .
&quot; ambig@@ u@@ ities are Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trustworthy and with strong executive functions . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ ke@@ cuts in the three candidates best from honesty , whereas life &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe him . &quot;
democratic voters of the presidential elections generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ideological in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; during all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions regarding Hill@@ ary Clin@@ t &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server will remain in office as Foreign Minister , most of the Democratic voters are pleased with their statement and say that their opinions were not influenced by a total of them . &quot;
but it &apos;s a different story in the American public altogether .
&quot; half of the Americans now are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion in this context was in March , shortly after the problem was coming out , split . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on their general opinions from Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion is still worse . &quot;
&quot; it is primarily re@@ public@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say their views of Clinton have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trustworthy , this is still a problem for them among voters overall : only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold for an honest and trusted person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of the elec@@ torate @-@ authorized nationwide also look as not honest and cannot be trusted . &quot;
Clinton and Tr@@ ump get good notes from leadership .
&quot; cut off the six people tested by Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush the best in honesty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards them as honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; the error rate for the sample of the &quot; &quot; 3@@ 51 &quot; &quot; voters in the elections is 6 percentage points . &quot;
Ben Car@@ son is moving close to Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is present in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times and Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; at the two candidates , half of the elec@@ torate at the new pol@@ l date in the new survey , and others lose dramatically in support : &quot;
Republi@@ can voters continue to support nationwide tr@@ ump in a large number . the support is increased from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before the 2012 news debate last month to 27 % in survey conducted from Tuesday .
but Car@@ son poured at the same time of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives at demographic groups and is rep@@ elled by Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ early Fior@@ ina and Ohio , Governor John Ka@@ ze , is fallen with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Governor Scott Walker , who fell on the deepest , and by 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Florida Governor Je@@ b Bush , the former Governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are situated at 6 % on the third place . &quot;
the troubles@@ hooting at the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / Or@@ c survey , published last week shows that Car@@ son rises in the surveys - he landed at 19 % support in Re@@ public@@ ans , behind the tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed trash clearly before Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at a walk from the last week rising Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump found some side @-@ si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son apologi@@ zed for it to question the umps . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Tr@@ ump said on Saturday past Saturday while a campaign appearance in Iowa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean Sea is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if cro@@ issants are measured only in the distance , for bath people a trip to the Mediterranean Sea , in order to still take some warm water . &quot;
a bath in North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure for a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; since then , there is no more sea : a maximum of 18 degrees the water in the North and Baltic Sea in this week , shares the German Weather Service ( Deutscher Wetter@@ dienst , DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , bathing temperatures still offers the Mediterranean : in the east it comes up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic Sea , it is at the forefront of 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood led to the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ no@@ un@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student during a chic ritual of a student @-@ connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , passed , M@@ ord@@ an acc@@ use against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ P@@ SI @-@ P@@ SI @-@ P@@ SI @-@ P@@ SI @-@ P@@ SI played a brutal attack during one introductory session in September 2013 and de@@ ferred his transport to hospital , which contributed to his death to the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said he was en@@ acted with related eyes with a 30 Po@@ unds pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked , while he tried to prepare over a frozen field to a goal . &quot;
Mr. Den@@ g finally lam@@ ented over head@@ ache when he became unconscious .
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ SI @-@ Brotherhood did not cry against the emergency number , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ or@@ her clothes , his symptoms to goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice to advice , &quot; &quot; Paul Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members of who were trying to hide and presented the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood - about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ zi@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not revi@@ ved , and he died next morning at his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an auto @-@ test report , Den@@ g has repeatedly added with mu@@ te force injury to head , torso and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ra@@ ils of the Brotherhood - at least one student dies since 1970 every year on the ra@@ ils , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ du family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and its members must be held accountable , and this step of authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e received an indictment for the murder of the third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of post @-@ religious attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to make the persons involved , but if there is an organisation that - officially , or un@@ official - this has also sanc@@ tioned , so we will also call these to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College is banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood does not rev@@ oked affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; when inser@@ ting comes , and the home se will come to the sha@@ king , ren@@ ces for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into a recession . &quot;
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
&quot; in particular , the history for the economy offers only a low guidance on the procedure . &quot;
a recession came in only 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve through raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in which the economy and the financial investments respond . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have so strongly stressed that investors do not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the time period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
in fact several variables play a role .
&quot; at the end , market participants could see that the whole excitement was potentially exagger@@ ated because of a interest increase . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inevitably to be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Apostle at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level in order to survive the se@@ is@@ mic shock that many seem to be fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions . &quot;
here is a focus on historical trends based on how some areas of the economy might react :
how the market in the last month has seen the anticip@@ ation of inser@@ ts things may make things more volati@@ le .
&quot; as soon as the increase makes , the influence is not that dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that wealth orders become decreased 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may perhaps again reflect the delay in monetary policy , said Deutsche @-@ Bank analysts in a newer study on what happens after inser@@ tion of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market has been in the past 35 years mostly in the increase - about 14 percent - on the path to the increase , fairly flat in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , which Bob D@@ oll , head system strateg@@ ist with Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , in Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the stocks will appear later in the under@@ estimate cycle and the yield in it begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but under@@ mining they often promote .
&quot; in the current case , F@@ ed is facing some conditions that could not have existed before and which could speed up a recession . &quot;
&quot; extremely not@@ e@@ worthy is here that the Gross Dom@@ estic Product will be near its lowest points , which will be a co@@ solic@@ ited from the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , 118 Z@@ inser@@ ts since 1950 was only twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.@@ 6 percent , only few are expecting this last quarter and expect only 1.5 percent at Atlanta F@@ ed for the third quarter . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ts at a so fragile economic setting could be risky and raise the question of &quot; &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants took place all year round , when the F@@ ed took place , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many str@@ ate@@ es and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could substitute an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading requires only a 25 percent increase . &quot;
&quot; in our study all the ca@@ vern @-@ cycles of 1950 was taken place today in a Super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum when taking place in GDP , and Be@@ fore rec@@ essions were also very quick after the beginning of recovery in the shadows &quot; , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession , the record was 35 months , and so are 74 months . &quot;
&quot; the firm income was also volati@@ le because the market is taking advantage , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market as it is on the capital market . &quot;
&quot; the main difference is that the effect of bonds is even faster than those in shares , when they change their strategic course . &quot;
&quot; in bonds , the ren@@ ces appear to change the direction once the first increase / reduction takes place in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the ascent of the cycle , the di@@ sen@@ ces fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
strateg@@ ists from Charles Corpor@@ ab believe that the increase in the interest rates will lead to bringing closer ties between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a down@@ fl@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate although &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ yst@@ ine at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting , Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in infl@@ ation@@ ary expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent policy . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the earnings performance is fl@@ atter , len@@ ders have increased and the volati@@ lity is increased - all the characteristics of the market , if the F@@ ed has intensified its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and entire enterprises , companies will benefit the greater part of their business operations in the United States , from which interest rates are increasing and local products are more attractive . &quot;
multinational companies with high debts are being worse off as an increasing number of dollars makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to respond extremely positively , three months after an initial inser@@ tion certificate , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customer . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded companies with increased balance sheet after each of the inser@@ ts 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at an average at 5 percentage points . &quot;
enterprises with high capital sol@@ vents and lower volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counterparts with lower quality on average every 4 ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percent@@ ages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; debts are a big problem . &quot;
businesses with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will most lose what Gold@@ man said .
&quot; outside the pure stock , consumers will also benefit from the rising Dollar as well . &quot;
&quot; savings can see profit by higher yields , even though experts in different opinion are how quick this will take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM radio CEO Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; conserv@@ atory member of the parliament critici@@ zed the transm@@ itter , because of its &quot; &quot; insulation &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is not able to distinguish between commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted on BBC Music Awards and said they are im@@ it@@ ated to The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the voice The Voice and said this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM that claims to be a leader in parliament and raises new pressure on the transm@@ itter to prove that he does not do anything that doesn &apos;t do anything .
&quot; conserv@@ atory MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses , that the public @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ ender &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; and is no longer distinguished by its commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t use the word &quot; &quot; silly &quot; &quot; but it seems to transform into Classic FM &apos; , he said . &quot;
he was also aimed at the BBC Music Awards held last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , announced last year , seem to be the Br@@ its only under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so , if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate you what is already in the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC @-@ General Director warns the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is ahead of its commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and to the general public .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will learn from classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that &apos;s truly un@@ rival@@ ed .
&quot; and to give Radio 3 &apos;s commitment to finding new music and to give new works , I am really important for you , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; argued at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that harder to get involved about the public , when it did so in the past because the British are less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during his hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport will run under fire to strike the commercial ri@@ vals for the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins , The Voice at - the BBC i@@ talent show of the BBC , that was purchased by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million pounds . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not especially distinctive ?
Lord Hall ins@@ isted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - was produced on special BBC mode .
&quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit out of our in @-@ house stable &quot; , &quot; if there was the next time a entertainment series . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from further rows of The Voice in the future or giving money to the other sub@@ ordin@@ ates for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet upheav@@ als rose to be responsible in August at the slower and Black Friday .
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobile phones to buy
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slo@@ wed down editions .
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual feed has dri@@ lled and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain have turned into gh@@ ost cities . &quot;
experts say that there are now signs that the online sales figures are stag@@ nat@@ ing after new numbers only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 showed .
&quot; overall expenditure of August , the lowest increase in growth since the start of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot;
experts say that there are signs that online sales will be st@@ agn@@ ant after new numbers only showed seven percent growth during the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the years and go back until 2000 , Andy has been developing in the course of the time &quot; , &quot; Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ DD sales of the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales strengthened three years ago , when Bu@@ yer started to make purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now , it comm@@ utes itself and we will possibly experience that growth is dras@@ tically reduced . &quot;
&quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is cited as a reason for wan@@ ing revenues . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that buyers can hold their purchases prior to this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers asked around their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some retailer sites cras@@ hes . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers clas@@ p because of bar@@ gain , buyers may stop away from purchases . &quot;
&quot; a study conducted by the British Ret@@ ail Consor@@ tium , found a little more than 1 £ on the cost of the British Ret@@ ail Consor@@ tium . &quot;
&quot; with some products , such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and wash@@ ers are carried out more than one third of shopping now via Web @-@ shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of the people are buying clothing and shoes online rather than being in the cities . &quot;
Muslims buried the in Mecca at the crane @-@ accident involving bin Lad@@ in family
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 People are carried by Muslims during the first funer@@ als in Mecca by the streets
&quot; Saudi Arabia sets down the collapse in part of the huge Saudi Bin Laden , causing a load to a load &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured , after the crane stor@@ med &quot;
hundreds of Moslems were gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the killed that were killed while a crane at Mek@@ kas were stor@@ med .
&quot; sadly , they met , mainly in white dressed , the way to declare their respect , when the first of the dead entered their last trip to Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ isse@@ m @-@ cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession moved to the Holy See , where only days before a building crane due to the blan@@ ket of the mosque and then on the side . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for funeral , when the Saudi @-@ king said about the construction company of the bin Laden because of the catastrophe , which also gave 3@@ 94 fl@@ ings out a san@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dents , who were killed as a crane packed by the Great Central @-@ mosque Mek@@ kas , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram out from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to be the crane . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi Official have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch to Mecca , by thousands who continue to go to town . &quot;
&quot; king Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden , told the Bin Laden , and the arm of the crane should not have been said when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; a Arab version of L@@ gs published by the state of Saudi Arabia Agency , said the Bin Laden @-@ group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language service of the news agency reported this detail , however , said that the leadership of the company was abroad . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man passed to un@@ veil what cras@@ hed the overthrow of the crane , who cras@@ hes into a courtyard of the Great Britain , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims from the p@@ addle held later this month . &quot;
the Bin Laden groups did not publish any statements on the breakdown of the crane ; and their representatives were not available for an opinion .
the mean De@@ an was bl@@ amed for the group because of no current security measures and because they did not cooperate with Meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cur@@ sions surrounded by cr@@ acks of Mek@@ nes@@ ian as part of the massive building that is run by the Bin Laden .
bin Laden has been connected to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and has been responsible for major construction projects .
&quot; the late leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , became a dis@@ loyal son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ 90s . &quot;
&quot; the turn of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy life . &quot;
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay in the hospital .

&quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other screening shops to address the crafts@@ man and share 60 outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Ber@@ ry said , she wants to take more women into B &amp; Q @-@ shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions will be taken in the store by women . &quot;
at the moment the men were ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the men .
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends which have more female Single @-@ Hou@@ ses , the more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Ber@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot;
we have to shift that stronger towards a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our customers from women are concerned with 80 percent of their decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a big role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Ber@@ ry , which is one of only five women at the top of a British at the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index of leading companies , has also been performing their top team to reflect a equal number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company , which covers exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial support . &quot;
Mrs Ber@@ ry said : &quot; this was a deliber@@ ate decision - diversity is here an important issue .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her announces a decline in half @-@ year profit and revenues , after the group started the cost of closing down the shops . &quot;
&quot; due to the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the screening and B &amp; Q is opening up 200 new branches . &quot;
Func@@ tion@@ aries of A@@ I / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity to judgment
&quot; on Wednesday , the bank of Kla@@ gen@@ furt on Wednesday presented two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vi@@ em@@ e@@ registry A@@ I / DO@@ B for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and Sett@@ lement . &quot;
the accused did not complic@@ it themselves .
one of them had also been charged with abuse .
by this accus@@ ation he had been acqu@@ itted of this force in May .
the current process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the quar@@ antine , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary examination that the accused did not have any funds of association accounts in the years 2006 to 2011 and disp@@ ose of them into their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage ended up at around 400@@ ,000 Euros . &quot;
the sports@@ wear are also charged due to financial failures .
&quot; this fact divided the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ats , Ri@@ ding in Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; to pro@@ ach the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence declared that the association has at no time created a asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports function had only been calculated for up@@ turn damage and the sports club , for which they had invested heavily from 1982 to 2011 and invested a lot of time and money from the debts - the pas@@ va amoun@@ ted to approximately 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( approx . 4@@ 4,000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we were standing before the situation : run the club further or do we lock ourselves ? &quot; &quot; one of the accused , in the workshop of large @-@ operation audi@@ ts . &quot;
he then decided to take this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all risks .
&quot; we have adjusted to money , under@@ score our life insurance as a safety in the bank . &quot; &quot; he said in the delay . &quot;
the association has been agreed with the association : you can freely manage the money ; there were only no debts .
&quot; furthermore , without the financial success , the payout of the resolution of repar@@ ations was postponed until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one took part of the allowance for years later , namely from the year 2003 , when an increase was paid to the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , packages l@@ ump and not in detail , explained the former Ob@@ jects of the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and savings @-@ books managed by the two def@@ endants , said the second def@@ endants . &quot;
why the withdrawal from the club had not been disclosed in detail and asked the judge .
&quot; the association has not been interested in the details of finance , but only the freedom of debt has been , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 against the official investigations for abuse of authority , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euro was transferred to the club &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; these have been back@@ pl@@ agues , said the def@@ endants . &quot;
&quot; this securities account went out on the name of the second accused , and according to whose statement the association was not known . &quot;
&quot; why ? , &quot; wanted to know the judge . &quot;
&quot; after this , the reader did not ask a reply . &quot;
&quot; finally he said , he believed that this was the best for the association . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known something of that money , pro@@ secutor was placed in the room . &quot;
&quot; said , The co @-@ def@@ endant was informed , justified itself the function@@ ary . &quot;
this refer@@ ral was formulated as a &quot; claim of damages . &quot;
why claims in@@ dem@@ nity ? we wanted to know Ri@@ ders and At@@ tor@@ ney .
&quot; said the first accused , he was not in agreement with this wording as the association has never been causing a damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; With this you are all from the hook . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary , he never referred a cent salary , he only charged mi@@ le@@ age and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , he got charged to the association € 1,000 per month ; however , the actual effort has been much higher he added . &quot;
accurate records for the early years could not be prescri@@ bing the accused .
&quot; after a work@@ station , in which everything was judged as correctly , no longer kept , explained . &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter was also referred to as the second def@@ endants .
&quot; all Ke@@ ats come in cash , so he had to drive from his home town to the bank to Blei@@ b@@ ur , he stated in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Re@@ ference Other 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to for three years of current recruitment , the computer giant will build further jobs during the spl@@ itting of the company . &quot;
the sub@@ missions of the U.S. Computer Scienti@@ sts He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) cannot find an end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US @-@ technology group plans to reduce the breakdown of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer @-@ saver . &quot;
&quot; in this way , costs of $ 2.7 billion are to be saved , distributed the company on Tuesday . &quot;
the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion which will result in the fourth quarter .
&quot; the extraction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed . &quot;
&quot; HP te@@ ached at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , approximately 30@@ 2,000 people . &quot;
next to the exchange was the He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard 2.3 percent after .
&quot; the consolidated group comprising the Califor@@ ni@@ an Pal@@ o Alto , divi@@ des itself : thus , the computer and printer @-@ business will be bund@@ led into a new society - separately from the bu@@ ffer areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services . &quot;
the two commercial targets are to be noted on the stock market .
a more disappointing PC paragraph and a weak@@ ening demand of corporate customers for his services took the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturers to Len@@ ovo at last .
&quot; in the third quarter of July , the sales of PC and pressure rose by 1@@ 1.5 per cent in the end of July . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to nearly 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
this means that the profits went back in 15 of 16 quarters .
HP answers with a split and massive post@@ ures to the changes in the industry .
&quot; the 76 years old company under the leadership of Me@@ g . Whit@@ man has responded late , that customers will be buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and getting more and more shopping online . &quot;
&quot; Whit@@ man restructuring plans will see a total breakdown of around 5@@ 5,000 positions in total . &quot;
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would be mainly in ref@@ usal : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent expressed appro@@ ving . &quot;
&quot; that other countries fly by air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , accounting for 61 percent . &quot;
24 percent are opposed to intervene in the conflict .
&quot; cooperation with the Syrian hegemon@@ ic regime Bashar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of those surve@@ yed , would be 20 percent . &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent her@@ nia of ser@@ ge@@ o @-@ Hungarian border
Hungarian police has deployed some hundreds of thousands of refugees at the Ser@@ b border to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ an@@ con@@ as and the water@@ front .
Eur@@ one@@ ws correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Boz@@ si@@ k has seen the spiral of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees crossed the border .
behind it a police line had formed and behind the gendar@@ mer@@ ie there was a water light .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees began to throw from stones , st@@ aves and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials first put off without ceas@@ ing pepper spray .
afterwards the police used Tr@@ an@@ eng@@ a .
many nas@@ ties were spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees now have a war@@ ting something withdrawn .
a pregnant and evi@@ dently woman was carried away out of the zone .
&quot; children who had met the Tr@@ an@@ eng@@ a , cried out . &quot;
other refugees dro@@ wns in themselves and suffered from breathing difficulty .
also the spokes@@ person of the Ser@@ b police suffered injuries by the use of lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ a and g@@ inger@@ spray .
time of decision on interest rates for US staff
&quot; the world ob@@ serves when the US staff will come together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , in order to make the important decision , whether for the first time since almost a decade , interest rates are raised . &quot;
&quot; one survey of 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned by Re@@ uters , found that a little more than half , last week of view was that F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will keep something longer and the interest rates remain on the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest amoun@@ ted to N@@ UL@@ L . &quot;
&quot; for the first time we approach one situation in which a major central bank would possibly drive the zero @-@ area and starts a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; Angel U@@ DP , guiding staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate just a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less harsh outlook on global conditions . &quot;
&quot; she has warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 20 : 00 am CET on Thursday
deaths in the Delta State University lag@@ ged exc@@ uses
&quot; after the shoot and kill@@ ings of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later he wrote his colleague &apos;s he and killed him , Sh@@ annon wrote a note to say he could &quot; &quot; I am &quot; &quot; with the first murder and wanted to make it happen &quot; , &quot; gave public authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said he &apos;s lecturer for geography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , calling the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and he said , he was shot to someone and someone killed . &quot;
he told the employee of the emergency central government that the police officers must send police officer to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house , but which will &quot; &quot; no one will interfere &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller according to his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lamb was not an explanation for his shots .
&quot; when the police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lamb : 45 , the said , &quot; &quot; I am sorry I could un@@ subscribe . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , she is the only wife who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note he took 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed Eth@@ ane Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally killed his own life on Monday night when poli@@ c@@ emen were killed him . &quot;
&quot; father President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs presentation . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday that he supposedly believed that P@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &apos; of a &quot; three @-@ relationship relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; A@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were about seven years old , as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; said &apos; Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss have had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; devast@@ ated &quot; &quot; in the ground . &quot;
he said that boun@@ c@@ ss were her daughter &quot; absolute best friends . &quot;
&quot; pre @-@ ss worked online from home , after statement from L@@ ins@@ day K@@ now@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of pre @-@ ss . &quot;
&quot; now K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with he for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said K@@ now@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , he had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to say to them , &quot; he did not go to prison . &quot;
&quot; when poli@@ c@@ emen were taken on the Highway 1 near Green@@ ville , he walked his car to the side , and fled into the forest , and sle@@ w himself with a shot . &quot;
he &apos;s represented in the spring of 2015 from the Delta State University as a post @-@ title as his style of life served at the university &apos;s website .
stars that have lost their luck
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner in Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot;
actors are also alleged to have been struggling with drugs and in 2008 he was condemned because of drugs .
all this surely demands its toll .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group over
the Lufthansa plans to have a large concert restructuring .
&quot; half a billion euros a year wants to save the Lufthansa @-@ Group alone with a better organization .
150 of the world &apos;s approximately 1000 executives will cost the Group restructuring as a job .
the pilot plant will give us momentum in the new negotiations .
the Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and values the quality of the Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the objective of the real@@ ignment is a result of some 500 million Euros per year from the cost of cost and redemption , and distributed the airline on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , in future , there will be no more board for the passenger volume in the future . &quot;
the bil@@ low @-@ sli@@ d Euro@@ wings are to be developed as independently as possible .
&quot; in the previous team , head of chief Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr in the future Karl Ulrich Sh@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings . &quot;
&quot; with the new position , Spo@@ hr under@@ scores the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet . &quot;
&quot; to date , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been a strong company complex . &quot;
&quot; the airline company under the roof of the S@@ line Group , which represents a total of three billion annual revenues of € 30 billion . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the Tari@@ ff bloc with the pilot &apos;s cock@@ pit ( V@@ IC ) , the negotiations are to be repaired after the strike on that Thursday . &quot;
this shared the union with them .
the discussion of the talks should be the silence @-@ proof control for pilots .
&quot; in a year , the cock@@ pit wanted to come to the results as quickly as possible . &quot;
the conflict between the union and the Air@@ line continued in the last months to several strikes .
&quot; in addition to the transi@@ ent supply of the pilots , the &quot; &quot; Space concept &quot; &quot; is laid out . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United may not play months @-@ long for double frac@@ ture .
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from the Champions League of Manchester to the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven a double frac@@ ture of his right B@@ one .
&quot; while this gave the lef@@ tist out@@ spoken to crying and close it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al is not hoping that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
&quot; the injury was caused by an reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 years old Sha@@ w was broken in the PS@@ V range . &quot;
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and required oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double construction and is in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he will be moved to Manchester , or perhaps one day later and later performed in Manchester . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then that is happening . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it will last six months , and it will not be in the group . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to escape a red card and a bul@@ ging of a ple@@ f@@ le .
&quot; Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , does not pen@@ alize the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al presum@@ ed that the Italian refer@@ ee had been vacc@@ inated .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f@@ M and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack on both legs .
&quot; a T@@ we@@ et to Sha@@ ws bank wanted : &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your news . words can &apos;t describe how cap@@ ut I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
thereby : Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat of the PS@@ V
England in France has an additional incentive to recover in France with the European Championship in France .
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer says , &quot; It &apos;s a very di@@ re injury . &quot;
&quot; if a player leaves the space of this type of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno exp@@ ires a leg nearest Mexico against Van Ga@@ eta &apos;s team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and when you then hear it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
it was not possible for me to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , who was on the way in a different direction , so it looked like him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; talking to S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard this can be . &quot;
I feel very badly at me . I am sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dad@@ o was also taken to hospital - by a f@@ ou@@ ch of Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron know The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not last long until you know it almost in@@ ward . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; as he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite child &apos;s book decided , the prime minister of The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , he wrote in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children because it seems always a picture or message that we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the follow @-@ up paragraph , in which Cameron is alleged to describe the action of the book , instead , re@@ mitting a table of publication of the movie release of 2012 , added to the new characters and details to expand the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city Th@@ ing @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , he reads his desire to hear a real tree , his correct name The@@ odor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage ho@@ oked and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this were not yet suspi@@ ci@@ ously enough : the text written by Cameron is read partly as the summary of the un@@ named city Th@@ reads @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to attract the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ bable that Cameron is the act of the book so little familiar . here stops an un@@ named boy , like the local environment by the cas@@ h@@ ens , trees fal@@ en@@ ched , Th@@ read@@ y@@ me@@ ek entities , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees &quot; , &quot; desol@@ ate . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR purpose was neg@@ ated to a hel@@ per that The Lor@@ ax did not read 20 times in a row of a child .
a Down@@ ing street speaker said that the text was probably come from Mr Cameron &apos;s voting office .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text of the Camer@@ ons employees was supplied , but there were no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened from the expul@@ sion of England &apos;s team , but it is still hard to see . &quot;
&quot; to@@ il Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you selected the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , there is a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ ward .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ looks page could possibly experience less than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the batt@@ ing list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will bear no scars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali serves as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an un@@ familiar size on the test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; in this message , Adam Ly@@ th is depar@@ ting from the England Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; letting the decision of Adam Ly@@ th has to let out of course is for me to be difficult to analyze in Yor@@ k@@ shire , which is difficult to analyse . &quot;
&quot; at his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that crime players are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination since - and I said this - players choose their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago I would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully fails to pick up other runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even though he did not show good achievements , and he does not surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
&quot; the question , how much time will acquire a test male , to put his mark is difficult . &quot;
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - how Sam Rob@@ son got in front of him , while Nick Comp@@ ton got started nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance of home and down@@ ward .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can rise was that in England first Jonathan Trot@@ ter was in the Caribbean , when Ly@@ th was in its maximum - but this lost shot is now in the past . &quot;
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a drummer that I cher@@ ish highly .
&quot; he is a X @-@ Factor @-@ Cri@@ tic player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us at a Tr@@ ento Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those obtained before him , but this depends of course on the teams in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to leave Mo@@ een in addition to Cook , which would provide a extra @-@ level Bow@@ ler and four Qui@@ cks , di@@ pped up , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
I don &apos;t see why a drummer could not beat there and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a hot @-@ shot of cri@@ cket players .
&quot; Mo@@ een perhaps did not do his job for County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but it is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before coming in 2001 as Open@@ er .
he did not make a hundred of us away and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes to a ca@@ der as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited use with him , he was very impressed as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see their statistics - an average of 31 with the ball and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there are no big number of backup spi@@ ders that raise their hands and the trainers have decided to play . &quot;
it will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Re@@ awar@@ ding , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nicest not@@ le of the game , which is bring a wealth of experience , since it has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes for the white ball @-@ phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the Setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international Cri@@ cket competition , as players or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela , has given insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can be fresh in the locker room , even if the news will be in accordance with the previously mentioned . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ l@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team members do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that they will depend on players their jobs from the results .
such decisions are not taken light by the heart .

foreigners have also their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at stand up and said again that some member states , so deeply ent@@ ails in various crises , as the EU is now and not always from their own fault , Britain itself constitutes an agenda with se@@ greg@@ ated concessions and interference changes , which they mostly don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; in Brighton , TU@@ C decided on its annual meeting that it may not be able to je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Ministers have been at meetings or bilateral meetings held in foreign capitals , making a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they are allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend who desires a looking outside Britain in the interior of the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and can look through that more and more short @-@ sighted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; war@@ y chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is one of his allies , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it is bad for her , as it has happened with the exagger@@ ated ag@@ grav@@ r@@ ists such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France François Hollande examines his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ ending force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nationalist right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that it will imagine a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British to prevent their energy better , Scotland &apos;s leaving the UK - something that they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have to be developed . &quot;
&quot; hence , some such ministers may even plan un@@ inten@@ tionally free notes , entirely at the SN@@ P @-@ style , while Britain &apos;s refer@@ endu@@ red campaign , in order to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , susp@@ ects my boyfriend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a Ple@@ ite , and &quot; Great Britain has won &apos;t anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tic is the oligarchy of the press bar@@ one , however , as it did not by Tony Ben@@ n inspired by 1975 but not , which supported our entry into 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ Opport@@ un@@ ists who made a name for himself as an &quot; &quot; EU t@@ ack@@ ban@@ ana ban@@ ana &quot; &quot; in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; during all his de@@ ath@@ edness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this was one of the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ful ch@@ ur@@ ks , phone @-@ h@@ ack@@ bo@@ ors and the pseudo @-@ poor countries that have most of our big newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually , Tony Blair was similar to her , however , stated that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one is better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ iri@@ ans than Blair himself , and Blair had opposed the principle beyond the not passed constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 that opened a door for him . &quot;
the press has never sent it to him .
&quot; but the nice Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cl@@ ap on his back on Monday - I said he had no time for me to be missed , Neil Kin@@ no@@ ck Boy@@ k@@ ott Mur@@ doch strategy of 80 @-@ he years to repeat , a mistake then and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take time but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC i@@ er he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ b@@ ur &apos;s official position to Europe is - I express it very friendly - in the development .
he says that we should remain a member of the EU .
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ el @-@ Ten@@ dency and the wil@@ dering shots of Tor@@ s@@ Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ismus might say any more to say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , &quot; but there was no Ben@@ n@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week , that the boy@@ sc@@ outs of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as a shadow Chancellor was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ th years , when his old father stro@@ ve for himself on television to be il@@ loyal to his Labour &apos;s cabinet , without losing too far and to lose his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s battle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to &quot; stay &quot; in all circumstances - Ben@@ n &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , nor what J@@ C told his collaborators and representatives from all reports on their refer@@ ral day on Monday night . &quot;
&quot; what always wants to bro@@ ker this disturbing bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - remember he even has stir@@ red up - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all , in the ma@@ el@@ strom of Social Media , a brood @-@ site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is correct to give Cameron not a free ticket for Europe , which permits him to keep lab@@ ours support in the campaign to give a matter of course , such as Mc@@ Don@@ nell . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins are sure about that .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ no@@ d &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ity for EU membership - in accordance with her Ben@@ n@@ ite Bel@@ ag@@ gregation Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is not just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the Nar@@ c@@ issu@@ s of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities in Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C has no campaign to exit the outlet - will be foreign diplom@@ ats to try to find , in all sense , a sense of their superi@@ ors . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have mis@@ trust@@ ful voters to make concessions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US has already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded at the start of Monday about something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise the report from Public Health England on e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; cont@@ en@@ tions of a public financing agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful as smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined R@@ z@@ et by taking criticism of the Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
p@@ he published the &quot; primary report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; an editorial published in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month the &quot; &quot; win@@ dy &quot; &quot; on the p@@ he found its most important conclusion . &quot;
&quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; an basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said the public expected that &quot; &quot; the present best estimate is that &quot; &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful as smoking &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of Refle@@ ction and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision @-@ decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) in order to conduct their opinions about the damage of various nicotine to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting called Euro@@ Swiss Health was , whose general manager was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
he also wrote the BA@@ T &apos;s references to public health in a sustainability report so they said .
&quot; one of the 12 participants in the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not financing that he will have received prior to reports prior to the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the body are not provided , but include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champi@@ ons , some of which can also specify a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco was also attended by p@@ he on the meeting .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; , &quot; there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence &quot; for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or limitations in the p@@ he report will be discussed . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; allegations of p@@ he that &quot; there are hitherto no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes should serve as a path to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
&quot; pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he , said that the claims of BM@@ J was already responded to . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are considerably less harmful to smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in its addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggest that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes compared to that are low , but that we continue to have long term effects to study . &quot;
&quot; he has the unique obligation to inform the public about what is eviden@@ ced by evidence and what not , especially when there is so much public confusion over the relative danger compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0.000 people are killed each year on a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking the national health system will cost two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; through the clear preference of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not at risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC must give rise to East@@ En@@ ders , says former head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop playing programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit @-@ shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broad@@ casting fee should only be used to make the type of programs sent not by other UK sender .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for the public opinion that they are probably seen by a smaller audience , which is likely to place among the most popular shows of their rival@@ als and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , said Johnson , that he tried to get into contact with other organisations for six years at his time at Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sends , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zing ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson of the Ober@@ haus @-@ communications Committee under his investigation on the Future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to hold the broad@@ casting procedure , what I think in the medium or long term does not hold for a good idea , one should at least transfer its production to programs , the others do not . &quot;
they send The Voice in a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art window because they want to achieve as much support as possible for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridiculous it &apos;s natural . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax program is being financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , admittedly both their own productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I am trying to see how this is to be public @-@ right TV .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , a business@@ for series , who ran from Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 told that the BBC is to blame for the hunt for reviews . &quot; because of the ambitions of those who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments to the most popular shows from the BBC show that the former manager of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart Conference in Edinburgh in 2003 fores@@ een that the BBC shows how East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where pretty much the audience can &apos;t judge , but they fulfil their tasks and they can argue if they have been created on their imag@@ inary missions to the justification of 4 billion £ broad@@ casting fees , &quot; &quot; Well , we have created all those above mentioned programs which no one has seen . &quot;
they place them in a window of time in which nobody ever wanted to see them .
&quot; for the broad@@ casting charge , Johnson said the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can maintain the best value in this way . &quot;
&quot; of course , think of all , think that you &apos;ll get a great value for $ 150 per year , but for people who is about 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they do not consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 manager David El@@ stein , who also announced before the Committee on Tuesday , asked that the BBC reviews its Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , to educate and maintain . &quot;
he said just few of the BBC @-@ production was now officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take a look at the public @-@ legal broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . we will inform and maintain .
&quot; on the issue of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like that of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television are shown , and enter into commercial channels in order to make all available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ son@@ o@@ Get &apos; can control brain cells by b@@ umps
&quot; the video shows how the ne@@ mat@@ o@@ ds change the direction in the moment , where they are pun@@ is@@ oned with acoustic impul@@ sive . &quot;
scientists have bred the wor@@ ms with genetically modified nerve systems which are controlled by er@@ brü@@ es of sound waves .
&quot; tiny Nem@@ o@@ ds change the direction in the moment , in which they treated with sound impul@@ sive , which for human hearing resulted in high frequencies to be heard . &quot;
impulses work by switching from Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react on ultras@@ ound @-@ waves .
further to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called son@@ o@@ Get , which ultras@@ ound can be used to enable a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside of your body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain application , an invasive procedure which gives electric impulses in the brain employed by people to treat the symptoms of Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; fil@@ ari@@ ers usually do not react on ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani reported that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , reinforce the ultras@@ ound @-@ waves , that penetrate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; the reinforced ultras@@ ound @-@ waves work in structures , which are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms cells . &quot;
&quot; the waves make the opening of these ion@@ en@@ channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , so a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create an ultras@@ ound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ den , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ c@@ annon use TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels . &quot;
&quot; when he applies ultras@@ ound to the changed creatures , the bi@@ b@@ umps are reinforced by the micro@@ blo@@ wers and then turn into the wor@@ ms , where they turn the changed motor @-@ ones . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some similarities with op@@ to@@ movie , a tra@@ il@@ bla@@ zing tool that allows scientists to turn neur@@ ons with stimul@@ i of light and switch off . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that son@@ o@@ ily may have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be sent to some optical fiber to the desired location in the brain , the rate of un@@ inhi@@ bited tissues can happen through tissues and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the hal@@ ted human neur@@ ons temporarily suscep@@ tible to the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for particular neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for the lives in student dormit@@ ories
&quot; eleven years ago , I lived as self @-@ for@@ ged 19 @-@ year @-@ old into a student dormit@@ ory , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the tense smile of those who I have been angry - and to the numerous , long @-@ made complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the feed @-@ off in student dormit@@ ories comes from light nerve wre@@ cking up to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to sweat : people tell where you come from wh@@ ence you come , if and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ches , where you are neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a sl@@ ant extra@@ Ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
inhal@@ e through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show you interest .
&quot; it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you find out the people who like you as opposed to those with which you would not speak , even if your eyelashes would run in fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers . &quot;
let people .
&quot; people often turn into beverages , film night venues and municipal galleries , but they are also the places where people attract and under@@ wear their under@@ wear . &quot;
related here@@ after : do not remember to start at the university with an relationship
In@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted obtained a crude treatment at the University .
&quot; their room should be a refuge , but many students lives up a space @-@ to @-@ space @-@ bit culture , which is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
&quot; this can be hell for someone , who is trying to recover . &quot;
&quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship going further , but you must go away so that I have taken away the energy that I consum@@ es you for interaction . &quot;
try to sense when a class@@ mates is exhausted by soci@@ alizing - and send it to him an SMS instead of .
apro@@ pos : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a non @-@ adju@@ sting door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship breaks through b@@ aking .
&quot; since you start at the top of the back Man@@ ie at the height of the back @-@ Man@@ ie , the clo@@ ister is imag@@ ining the doors of people , to get less strange as the welcome the 1950 @-@ er years &quot; &quot; Welcome to the neighbourhood , I have to give you something out . so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
&quot; your room@@ mates feel compelled to entertain yourself and will end up your face with a delicious surprise . &quot;
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
&quot; un@@ mixed cl@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people to sleep again when you drop anchor . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is an un@@ used crime in student dormit@@ ories .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ aws of chicken is a theft , but is it taking one drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check this with the dairy owner .
&quot; the chances are good , they say to themselves use themselves , even if they cook in the interior . &quot;
&quot; if anyone ste@@ als your things , this is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with them as my room@@ mate , who added a washing @-@ up to them , to pun@@ ish the th@@ iev@@ es of the th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise that stops people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent person , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of being the pro@@ ver@@ b to the people who sit in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my hallway asked her neighbors , if they should give them some sense , drum &amp; bass a little qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
you reacted with even c@@ mature music .
&quot; when she finally got up at 5 o &apos;clock , she left her neighbors again for two hours before she left her own music , closed her door and ended up to her three @-@ hour inspection . &quot;
would it not be romantic when your future spouse would fall into the same student dormit@@ ory ?
&quot; it would not be deeply embarrassing , if you have a room@@ mate for your future marriage , turn right into her , separate yourself and then experience it every day and perhaps experience how they all have shared their friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot mate is definitely not your future marriage partner , try to talk a little reason at least to give your shelter . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that somebody has lost his key in his not inter@@ ned room , the boundary between a Ul@@ k and bullying ? it seems that it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good track is fun , but it just takes moments until he is bo@@ omer@@ ang to the bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
place through Ver@@ stuck a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never bre@@ wing someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but stap@@ ling your possessions on the ceiling are no more than twice . &quot;
&quot; town@@ houses for refugees , all @-@ cat@@ er@@ ated , low @-@ comp@@ resses &quot;
the property business owner Markus Gil@@ dner builds the Eck@@ ental terr@@ aced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; about for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the only mother and the bar@@ gaining class . &quot;
&quot; I am showing how to add cheap and well @-@ priced today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for an apartment .
&quot; the entrepren@@ eur who believes in knowing how quickly cheaper living space can be created , building in a project terr@@ aced houses for refugees . &quot;
&quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for a visit to an apartment . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass containers in containers or turn@@ around has no sustainability .
because men remain a great part of it here .
&quot; in view of the refugee flow , we need enough housing over the next decades . &quot;
a very mund@@ ane terr@@ aced house building is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a terr@@ aced house needs least capacity .
it facilitates the integration .
that is different when the people are sub@@ mits to the people of the apartment .
&quot; each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three units for four asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; every unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees will say , it is again peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be changed easily according to the needs of your needs .
how much is the cost ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is 18@@ 4 000 , with no property . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six months has taken the building .
this is reasonable .
have the building rules make their plans more complicated ?
Gil@@ dner : so I have drawn my project correctly .
particularly complicated it is always the dro@@ pping Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ try custom @-@ made special construction and the Stell@@ ite Reg@@ ulations .
di@@ us@@ el@@ y .
&quot; still sub@@ mis@@ ed , who creates three apartments in a row House , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities no space is missing .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants react to their terr@@ aced house ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who have accused me of creating new luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
what is definitely not wrong .
but do you not ti@@ te the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS device when Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by default on &quot; &quot; Android &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone gives you an option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some are progres@@ sively informed after the installation , since they get an error message that en@@ cor@@ es that the &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; fails . &quot;
&quot; to circum@@ vent problems , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or try to update about iTunes . &quot;
the telephone itself will lead you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may cause the delete of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely to do this by making the updates rather more likely , if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s worth to make sure your mobile phone is loaded during the update or is close to a charger , so that the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; if the cargo is too low , Apple cannot be seen that the update will continue , as the telephone may be up half @-@ way distances and could lead to an interruption of the updates . &quot;

in this case there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; not rarely many achievements of the races are not avail@@ ed because the complexity of insur@@ ances is hardly yet understood , &quot; &quot; the new house@@ holders &quot; &quot; explained to Alten@@ ta W@@ eig@@ and , who is responsible for the nurse , as well as for the &quot; &quot; Ama@@ deus Award &quot; &quot; as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ deus . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consultations , the new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ office but also offers prevention , health problems and wellness . &quot;

&quot; one out of the group , a 17 years old new Afgh@@ an , followed according to the police of his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at this time the group was on the level of the B@@ FT petrol station .
on the site of the gas station there were also three persons .
&quot; one of these men now ri@@ pped the young , and struck his face on it with the fist . &quot;
the sacrifice suffered a nas@@ al nas@@ al infection and ble@@ ed greatly from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends were ha@@ iled and relevant to the r@@ ack@@ et , this first of all left by his sacrifice . &quot;
from his friends the injured young man was now brought home .
the per@@ secutor per@@ secuted the group by passenger cars up to his apartment and drove there demonstrations several times over .

Dr. Frank Müller is taking over practice in Fel@@ ce@@ tera and has invested 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ce@@ ausen .
&quot; furthermore , Sam@@ ba @-@ renowned Bernd Bor@@ mann , Business @-@ transport in Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , doctors -- A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand are missing : there , Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice in Fel@@ ce@@ ausen on the 1st of October . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel goes into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still under half a position to her husband over the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after an expansion phase , Müller will open the practice on October 12th , until then he will invest 3@@ 10000 euro in the premises at the St.@@ Mary Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; sympathy was made at first glance , when the Fel@@ lowship has met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently trained their professional career formation in the den@@ omin@@ ative hospital and intends to enter into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the trav@@ eller would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; says Dr. UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ce@@ ausen and lau@@ ghing . &quot;
&quot; when it was ready , I was simply called . &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to continue to operate in A@@ sen@@ dorf in future in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; the proximity and the constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we would like to get to know and accompany the families of the years ahead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also will soon be his own boss . &quot;
and so you agree that the Mü@@ llers are trading the house with the practice .
these will also continue to live in Bru@@ k@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; there is a double family father Frank Müller also grew up , his medical degree in Hannover pursued in several medical offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ k and Rot@@ tel . &quot;
currently he is active as a pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cian in Sul@@ ingen . he was appointed a leading specialist doctor in Di@@ ep@@ wood in 2009 and is engaged himself as a honorary member of the DR@@ K @-@ readiness Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
starting from 19 September is the practice for the new boss .
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich ri@@ ste@@ ausen noted as a primary specialist , his spouse H@@ UR@@ SE@@ L ( inter@@ viewer ) specialized in gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the Mü@@ llers , both inter@@ nis@@ ts , do not want to settle for themselves as a household . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out therefore , &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
after the reconstruction the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultras@@ ound examinations as well as long @-@ term and resili@@ ent @-@ EK@@ GS as well as need a separate room more .
&quot; furthermore , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a subsi@@ dy of a total of 50@@ 000 Euro get the Mü@@ llers as part of a funding program from the County ) , as well as from the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued uph@@ eld , &quot; says Sam@@ et@@ le @-@ mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; approximately 2000 patients come according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , each quarter in practice , in the northern German average practice , it is about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another general practitioner .
a positive side effect of the practice response by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to UR@@ SE@@ L fiel@@ d@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor would have found it would have gone .
&quot; who visits the Expert Consul@@ tation , by the way , still looks in familiar faces : taking over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the rock faces . &quot;
&quot; with their departure ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the medicine has been practiced for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel reminds himself . &quot;
a little melanchol@@ y after the long time already .
&quot; but we &apos;re still living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients will probably see many patients , &quot; &quot; says Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; your man supplements l@@ ach@@ ingly : &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 m @-@ meter plot . &quot;
&quot; so far I have always pressed before gardening , but now it could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the couple has two grandchildren and travelled extensively . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees
&quot; well , the border controls are also high on our south@@ ward , &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain upright parallel .
&quot; how before was it clear that anyone who wants to make a refugee deal , this is also &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of people are in the foreground .
&quot; but it is clear that there are strong signals required , &quot; &quot; said the Prime Minister . &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept it@@ less migration flows but not over the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia safely wing &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia
Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia &apos;s plans going to travel ahead towards Austria and Germany and also under certain circumstances that cor@@ ridors for refugees need to build .
&quot; this , however , did not see this Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ inn@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ ridors is &quot; absolutely inakzeptabel , &quot; Slovenia rather becomes the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary - intensi@@ fying . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia was heavily controlled as the border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to not reflect its borders for refugees but not to fix . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; Mr. Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ inn@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government shared , the first refugees had already tried to travel in the night hours on Tuesday to pass the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in East Croatia to so@@ ak the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could resort them in the nearby ma@@ is@@ fields .
&quot; according to local media since then in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the national vehicle has continuously been dealing with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in operation .
&quot; in the coming days I reck@@ on his country of around 4,000 refugees , said Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; the buses from Pres@@ er@@ evo , the Maced@@ onian border that have previously brought to the Hungarian border to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that people listen to certain routes : &quot; either we do , we still want to do this , &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; according to the media report , in the morning , a first bus had arrived at approximately 50 refugees in the Ser@@ b border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day continued buses would expect . &quot;
about Croatia and Austria and Austria to Germany
the in@@ mates were travelling the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border to Serbia about 500 kilometres away .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has made , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; by doing so , it could actually now be the shifting shift of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Greece @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west route . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister in O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has prepared for the fall of a strong de@@ gas flow of refugees , appropriate plans for possible shooting situations . &quot;
&quot; he did not call him , he pointed out that Croatia has a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive possibilities for the border control . &quot;
you conduct strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of it since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently reported a good witness to the country , leading to the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , behind the Hungarian border fence we continue to hold 300 refugees . &quot;
&quot; according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media report , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , who runs to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
according to the Hungarian authorities the two border crossing Hor@@ gos and B@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely locked .
&quot; if the remaining refugees want to travel to Croatian border , is still unclear . &quot;
Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to so@@ ot@@ he early at a local appearance in Hor@@ gos : keep the debates on alternative routes of refugees following the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be a big amount of refugees to pay .
&quot; it could not be said that they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - aging routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee heroes have already begun to distribute to the refugees land cards , on which alternative routes are shown through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in some parts of the border area , 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , it is still not sp@@ min@@ ated min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police gave known that a team of de@@ min@@ ers was sent to the border region .

&quot; according to this , the investig@@ ators were raised in more than 100 million dollars . &quot;

&quot; the &quot; &quot; E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice &quot; &quot; was attentive to her action on her 20 @-@ year anniversary and is quite closely faced with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it is all about life , so we went into action in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; says Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the leader of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ it@@ ational assistance is available for questions and discussions as well as the voluntary workers .
&quot; while some are a Pass@@ ant spontaneous for cra@@ yon and the sentence for &quot; my life , &quot; we can read , &quot; &quot; stop &quot; &quot; with the camper from the USA , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not long &quot; &quot; to read , read sentences as &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again they develop on the ver@@ ge of little discussions about the action , about life , dealing with the dying . &quot;
also Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is just locally .
&quot; only when I make it clear that for me sometime I come to the end of this world , I can live responsibly , &quot; &quot; says the Director of the Diak@@ onischen Werkes Mannheim , which together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ association is the sponsor of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this direct action to the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good . &quot;
&quot; however , that not everyone wants to public@@ ise them on the tablets , be understandable , as it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and dying is frau@@ ght with t@@ abo@@ o , so the experience of Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer , although the experience of Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer , albeit much more contributed to the family &apos;s liberation movement in recent years . &quot;

the Ster@@ be@@ - and O@@ bit@@ u@@ aries is one of the most volunteers of the first lesson .
&quot; by personal experience with the subject , they read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice was sought by an appeal for volunteers , it had immediately been reported and had been with the foundation in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ ess@@ roid is a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the resulting and relatives of private households , hospitals , nursing homes and hosp@@ ice @-@ St. Vincent . &quot;
all are them carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can work well with its function and the experiences made and experiences made .
&quot; I see life from another fron@@ tier , consider it precious and este@@ emed the moment , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
the offer of the out@@ patient ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ it@@ alisation is free of charge and con@@ fes@@ sions independent .
&quot; the financial support for the health and donations of depend@@ ents and injuries allows the training as well as further training and super@@ visions of the Ster@@ cor@@ - and O@@ bit@@ u@@ aries , respectively . &quot;
every two years there are training courses for new employees .
&quot; the tablets described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the protest@@ ant church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot;
other personal wishes on post@@ cards can also be noted there .
F@@ ed@@ Ex result is mixed by fin@@ ish@@ ance prospects for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reported disappointing results for the last quarter and the Lie@@ fer giant gave his profit out on a whole year due to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in his bo@@ wel motion .
&quot; the company also said that she is planning to recru@@ it approximately 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this point in the last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the business needs 50,000 employees for the holiday season . &quot;
the stock was about 2.5 percent in the Pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a prize of 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than with previous pre@@ diction . &quot;
analysts do not expect a survey of a Facebook set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower view comes despite the price increase , which amount to 4.@@ 9 percent and on 4th January , and despite higher ass@@ aults for bo@@ labour systems of heavy and large par@@ c@@ els , which will be charged starting in November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it was expected to increase the result from the previous year due to cost of cost , higher profits , and due to growth in online commerce . &quot;
&quot; CEO and CEO Fred Smith said that the company inv@@ ests solid yields in considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for the holiday employment were announced one day later than those of the Rival U@@ PS , who plans , 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra workers , about the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than last year . &quot;
&quot; the earnings per share stood at 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of T@@ acks Investment Research asked analy@@ st . &quot;
its sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of the Z@@ acks asked analy@@ st for 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported in recent years a decline at international primary shipping arrival in order to st@@ agn@@ ate sales in his O@@ TC delivery unit .
but the boom in online @-@ Shopping played the results with F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales climbed by 29 percent during the last quarter , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express Unit recorded higher earnings based on higher prices , while the result declined because of higher labour costs in cargo business . &quot;
&quot; in the market market trading , about an hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex stocks rose by 3.@@ 85 billion , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they merged with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June . &quot;
&quot; on their most highly anticipated meeting in the year Federal Reserve B@@ ate@@ gen spend two days sitting this week on a 27 feet in Honduras @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade to start the circuit board . &quot;
&quot; on them at one end of the completed , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed sitting room is a mur@@ derer from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the map is reminder to remember that F@@ ed @-@ president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ elles and her colleagues put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold Order of Congress : maximize the US &apos;s employment and price stability here .
but since the big recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is a third @-@ Third mandate : financial stability .
&quot; this third mandate might be the X factor in a decision that is too tight in order to pre@@ dict it . there will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by the immediate short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data from the economy show that it grows strong , the recent turmoil in the global financial markets the more pru@@ dent F@@ ed representatives are anxious to increase these volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for Bundes@@ an@@ bor@@ ns - even if it is one quarter percentage . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation is first and foremost the foremost what they are watching , &quot; said Lin@@ d@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ists in the making company Sti@@ ll Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if it were looking for a pretext to not increase the interest rate , the increased insecurity about the global market enough justification , continued to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which secur@@ es itself to the financial market . &quot;
&quot; about half of econom@@ ists , who were recently interviewed by Bloomberg , have predicted a matter of advertising per week . &quot;
&quot; financial markets expect the F@@ ed , however , with a key indication that shows only a 30 % chance of increasing . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a drop in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strateg@@ ists mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow , ensuring that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial average is worth 22.@@ 8.@@ 89 points or a 1,4 % on 16.@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed @-@ policy pers@@ ists the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Apostle at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , she would have to go far too far to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a quar@@ rel@@ ing would re@@ assure the financial markets because they would act the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; just a month ago , F@@ ed seemed on good paths to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first step towards a slow ti@@ ghtening of mon@@ t@@ arian conditions which would test the strength of recovery in the United States . &quot;
&quot; in spring and early summer , Y@@ ella had said that this year despite the complaints of the Liber@@ als that more economic progress was needed , an increase in the state . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slo@@ wed up , the improvement in the labour market was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate sank to 5.@@ 1 % in the past month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the level , which the F@@ ed has seen as full employment . &quot;
wages have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and despite inflation continued under the annual objective of 2 % of the central bank , F@@ ed representatives spoke that the main reason the temporary effects of significantly lower oil prices would be . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and also needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief Apostle at the Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets performed all over the world last month , after China had its currency valued . &quot;
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial Feder@@ alists fell in May by more than 16 % below its peak , as investors feared that a slo@@ wing of the Chinese economy would make global growth . &quot;
&quot; in this month the market has recovered a while , the Dow is now around 10 % below the level of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market upheav@@ al influence the complexity of the complex calculation as you should also increase the interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in recent few weeks would not be in this session , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. staff . &quot;
they pre@@ dict that they will wait at least a month to better control the impact .
&quot; there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is one of the main interests of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in their decision @-@ making process . &quot;
yet in the end the F@@ ed monetary authority in the world has become .
the impact of the central bank has increased tremend@@ ously over the past few years .
&quot; the mere reference to Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in the year 2013 , that the F@@ ed could close their monetary expansion &quot; &quot; tight &quot; , &quot; con@@ fu@@ sions around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to monitor the developments in others , but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Car@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ cour@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeffrey L@@ acker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to financial market movements , which apparently cannot be associated with economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; st@@ acker , as a particip@@ atory member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advocates for inser@@ ts , commented decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark interest in three sessions by 0.@@ 75 percent@@ ages in three sessions , despite the restricted impact on growth in the USA . &quot; &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives were re@@ vert these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis like the market level in 2008 , said Adam S. Posen , former member of the Committee on the interest of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the latest turbul@@ ence are not coming close to this level , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly wants not to get into the situation where they are afraid of a quar@@ tering , because the markets are exciting , &quot; said Poz@@ nan , President of the St. Peter Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act continues to have double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t think that it should hurry ahead . &quot;

Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy silence
Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to clear women both shocking and healthy eating during the lac@@ tation period . she is doing this with the presentation of pictures of babies which are painted with portra@@ y@@ als of unhealthy foods .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins , and carbohydrates that babies give up all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; because of the additional energy requirements , s@@ ang@@ ers and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research findings indicate that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ ete@@ tic adaptation needed to them . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy eating pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an unhealthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively impact the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ be in the sports hall
the municipal council of Bern@@ ried approved the building application for the 2,3 million euros of the sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
&quot; the planning for the long @-@ looking turn@@ e@@ cho@@ es at the edge of the sports complex step by step forward : in the recent council meeting , the marked construction line was agreed without any large discussions with no big discussions . &quot;
&quot; ever , the Panel had also decided on an application for a construc@@ ting legal &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; from the valid construction plan among other things . &quot;
&quot; exception &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; according to this , a &quot; gab@@ led roof , &quot; should not be built with either @-@ in First and Dach@@ stein . &quot;
&quot; the background of planning is the intended use of the roof area for solar facilities : &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large South dd@@ ach , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; liberation , in turn , once more focuss@@ ed on the roof @-@ prop@@ ens@@ ity which is required for energy reasons - unlike in the building plan - must lie below ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan provides no &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - whereby the amber head is usually more restric@@ tive in the rule of liberation . &quot;
&quot; however , for the turn@@ e@@ construction , this is not a recur@@ rent project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the turn@@ e@@ construction at the Sports Centre is a communal project of the community and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
the cost is approximately 2.@@ 2.3 million euros .
subsidies are expected by school and grass@@ roots promotion .
&quot; in the next draft step , the application for the 18 x 36 metres large hall is now presented to the reserve for the examination . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg pull to Sch@@ ong@@ au
Th@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will take charge of new Medical Director at the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
the station and the majority of the employees draw from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg with to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this was shown to see the striking plans of the hospital GmbH of the County , the is@@ itor of Andrea Jo@@ asi@@ er @-@ White . &quot;
&quot; the Board of Govern@@ ors , The Supervisory Board , and the Supervisory Board on the next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans are put into action , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority was to be moved by Fischer and the further existing internal station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
&quot; the employees , who cannot be moved with to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a work place in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so Jo@@ gal @-@ White . &quot;
the employees are informed about their plans .
&quot; triggered the change from Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been Managing Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer hospital since year beginning and now changes in private practice at close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; the question of who would take the follow @-@ up was according to Jo@@ chner @-@ white , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; into the game , which was ready to take over the direction from 1 October onward and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au cinema , this is in any case a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the &quot; &quot; Interior medicine &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; Interior medicine &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; Arts Medicine &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist on p@@ ac@@ em@@ aker and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the interior station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic disorders .
&quot; it is intended for the next two years with his team when the Supervisory Board agrees with his team when the Supervisory Board agrees , until then last year the former Hospital of Kn@@ app@@ y , which has more than 35 beds , has finally been closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; so far , the County had planned this for 2018 , if the ongoing recovery in the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is now completed . &quot;
&quot; em@@ ir@@ er of Arts and White , which is also chairman of the board of directors , was looking forward to rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the state treas@@ ury , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; I conclude there . as it continues with the property , Jo@@ chner @-@ White could not say , there are several reflections . &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ time care of the Car@@ itas and a tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chi@@ ry .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , as fishermen about the Qu@@ asi @-@ moving to the Le@@ ch , who has been received positively and very understand@@ ably . &quot;
&quot; a true perspective for the house , where Fischer has been working as a leader , for over 30 years . &quot;
he was asked to be asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take the post of medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was once again threatened by closure , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the Obst@@ etri@@ cs . &quot;

after a jump @-@ out a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were taken into hospitals .
&quot; how exactly it could come to the accident , was first unclear . &quot;

a Tat@@ ry @-@ country has led the police to cor@@ pse of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
&quot; in the dec@@ ember , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old gave birth to the young people and their bodies had thrown into a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
a moder@@ ated 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate is a non@@ violence to the victim .
&quot; on Tuesday evening , the young woman was found at Kaiser@@ slau@@ tern at Kaiser@@ slau@@ tern , like Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Office and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as a tat@@ too , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old also regarded that the indication could indicate the indication and the investig@@ ators were brought to the place of discovery of the cor@@ pse . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was inter@@ ming@@ led on Sunday mor@@ nings after they didn &apos;t stand back home on the eve after a fall of autumn .
in searching for the young woman investig@@ ators beg@@ s the investig@@ ators first to personal belon@@ gings of the victim .
&quot; with survey in friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the surve@@ ying , eventually a crime no@@ d@@ led to the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ ting perpetrators brought the police to a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ pse was found . &quot;
&quot; the arrest gave the authorities to be in the police case , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and the cor@@ pse have put in the channel . &quot;
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the custody @-@ stand on Wednesday the investig@@ ators put the killing to him .

refugees need accommodation : study warning of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is tense .
even more and more refugees look for a affordable place .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles in the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and the people seeking out of the EU , more and more people are pushing on a market that already are over@@ loaded in many cities . &quot;
you compete with high @-@ minded people for the final paid apartments .
&quot; in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , a total of 400@@ ,000 new units must be built up to 2020 . &quot;
a study within the committee of the association debate &quot; social housing construction . &quot;
&quot; to compare , this year is completed in Germany 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units . &quot;
&quot; thus , it lacks 14@@ 0.000 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an introductory accommodation . &quot;
many come across the apartment market and are put into the long queu@@ es in front of the flat rentals .
&quot; according to statistics office in the last year , less than half of all asylum seekers were to rent . &quot;
the negative development of the apartment market is not only due to the rising of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the construction of housing over the past few years .
Germany sho@@ ots an accommod@@ ates from year to year that gets bigger from year to year .
&quot; currently , in the case of the Ball@@ isti@@ án , Matthias Günther , author , and Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many Appe@@ als therefore lived in big cities free of capacity in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed un@@ inhi@@ bited in the apartment house for the pl@@ unge in the apartment house .
in the large cities the number of square meter per capita in the past few years has fallen back .
&quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &apos; social housing building &apos; suggests a new start . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives for social housing should be restored . &quot;
this could be avoided on the land transfer tax and the fundamental tax for subsidi@@ zed apartments will be suspended .
&quot; furthermore , an alliance with attractive tax @-@ search options may be needed . &quot;
the funding programme for Refu@@ ge@@ es of State Bank Kf@@ W is already working well in towns and villages .
&quot; after the start of the start , a good week after the start was sold at the Monday night of 18@@ 4 million euros more than half of the 300 million euros at its disposal . &quot;
now the project could be even interven@@ ed .
refugees have free conduct : Croatia and Slovenia have a corridor
&quot; practically no longer can come through Hungary , as more and more refugees will vote the way via Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces the transit of Slovenia to the north without a hur@@ d@@ les .
&quot; but it is dangerous , the route is still dangerous . &quot;
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighboring country of Slovenia through the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken to the slo@@ ven@@ ian internal Minister , and if it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian interior minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ country Croatia is not yet a Schengen area .
&quot; after the turn of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to reach Western Europe from there to Western Europe . &quot;
500 people had arrived at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik &apos;s border on the Croatian TV station RT@@ L .
Hungary had sailed its border to refugees on the day before .
new laws that occurred the same day in force make over@@ take asylum procedures in Hungary practically superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to leave refugees .
Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic declared : &quot; you can go through and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who live and want to achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , people who do not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
Croatian police took the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia .
&quot; most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they had come to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d with both the bus and taxis .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk on the green border to Croatia .
&quot; indeed , on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border the refugees meet not at the border . &quot;
&quot; to do this , the border strip contains other hazards : there are sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
de@@ min@@ ers are now making a safe passage .
&quot; after the closure of the border , after the closure of the border no more refugees arrive . &quot;
on Tuesday the police had 3@@ 66 attacked people .
shortly before Tor@@ p on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws make sense to the overthrow and damaging of the border level as a crime .
&quot; therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were introduced at the South @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eged . &quot;
endangering the susp@@ end risk of arrested for up to five years and deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , one took off on Tuesday in the newly designed &quot; Tran@@ sitting &quot; for a total of 94 households , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two elderly people . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , there were still 40 refugees left . &quot;
&quot; in fact , no one has had a prospect of getting asylum in Hungary asylum . &quot;
&quot; after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the distr@@ acted asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported .
&quot; before the &quot; &quot; Tran@@ sit@@ ter &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there were only a few hundred refugees . &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to take off .
they gathered the garbage that left tens of thousands of people in the past few weeks at the road@@ side .
pl@@ y@@ fly screens have been eliminated and one of the reception camp in the border town was rebuilt .
&quot; for the purpose of this change , no one wanted to speak . &quot;
Austria is only a few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also has its border controls .
&quot; but around 20,000 migrants were still sitting down in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the way to Germany . &quot;
the train station from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the discretion of German authorities .
we regularly met smaller groups of refugees in open air .
Mayor did enter &quot; str@@ anded &quot; on the border
&quot; after the bridge we were busy on Sunday with the show@@ room , when suddenly ten people were standing with travel ham@@ lets at the entrance of the tent , &quot; W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to get by train to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; but because Germany had no surprise the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow , it was close to them in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; says the city centre , who immediately offered his aid and str@@ anded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars via the border into N@@ ahe Pass@@ au . &quot;
before we were forced to shor@@ ten the un@@ hoped @-@ for guests with lun@@ ar and drink .
&quot; we said the same , we take it by car to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ thalle in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
you were very grateful .
&quot; a man did not let him take , to hand a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire department . &quot;
&quot; this is what we were really happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening in Wels on Sunday night the trade exhibition went down from an ICE in a regional train direction Pass@@ au , to leave it after the short notice that the railway traffic was set to Germany but still trying to try the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was placed in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn . &quot;
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border @-@ border generally comes high in the course .
the Br@@ ücken@@ fest association with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably - organised from the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; now that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent more tens of thousands of us , is a logical result of a seem@@ ing policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping to establish itself in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , in order to help the structures of Human@@ ism , our Chancellor officially cancelled the position of the Hungarian government to the neo @-@ circle of National Socialism . &quot;
suffering from this policy are not just those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted in the border regions with chaotic conditions .
&quot; the refugees also have to say that the &quot; &quot; prevailing land &quot; &quot; they invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a major challenge given the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , in our decent conditions for the seekers of seekers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ rad in search of 3@@ 5,000 winter@@ proof &quot;
Konrad has full of hands with the refugee measure .
Christian Konrad is it used that His word weight has weight .
the government used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen ban@@ kers to make recei@@ pts for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first @-@ order center Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip already in the handle .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tr@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; one of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without a large vor@@ tex , &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in contrast , the Interior Minister spoke of a &quot; cr@@ ass situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , Konrad expects an increase of 8@@ 5,000 quar@@ es in the hot year . &quot;
&quot; to meet the number must be found in the next few weeks even 3@@ 5.000 apartments - 20,000 people will be able to make 15,000 inhabitants € 15,000 . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can make it happen . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a cas@@ ass without ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
with the governor he has already led talks .
&quot; they would have secured him , even for the upcoming refugees too . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er said . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar is assisted by Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , then it will be dec@@ eived as the church will help . &quot;
&quot; large expectations of the asylum Co@@ ordinator also in the OR@@ F promotion &quot; Hel@@ ps like us &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform can provide services with simple accommodations .
&quot; furthermore , one hopes for hotels that are empty during the winter time . &quot;
&quot; finally , Konrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ sans have to uph@@ old a certain amount of the hand @-@ holder or the size of the frank@@ ness . &quot;
for a refres@@ hed time would need to be &quot; emergency standards . &quot;
&quot; that he is successful in contrast to the Department of Interior in the accommodation of a successful institution , reveals Konrad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am a older gentleman , who you cannot say without further into the face of fal@@ se@@ hood . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er do not cause any costs , as they themselves explained . &quot;
your head@@ count will increase them from three to four .
my own block of calculations has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container on Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there is obviously problems with the permit .
Linz for a better distribution
&quot; first , no opening of Urban sport@@ clubs and other buildings like tips @-@ arena and design center for accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; at present , this is not necessary , as one could manage these measures currently without these measures , &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ gger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; however , further sites should be tested for exchange . &quot;
critic@@ ising the city &apos;s chief to the distribution of refugees in the Federal Republic .
also other districts must contribute to their contribution .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders will not be cured &quot;
in a longer telep@@ hon@@ y with the Bav@@ arian minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) on Monday the main action took place in the refugee question .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer gave me assur@@ ances that the German borders could not be cured .
the departure of refugees to the Federal Republic will continue to be possible .
but there are now the corresponding border controls .
special suits with refugees to Germany will not be there for the first time .
however the protective searches were brought to Germany with regular journeys to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once asked for increased solidarity in the refugee question . &quot;
&quot; that now Austria leads at its limits again , is &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is a matter of time
&quot; the general re@@ group@@ ing of the &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer has been officially completed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of office and production building , the Stock Exchange S &amp; T Group is dra@@ fted , the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meters ) is designed to be rented to young , innovative companies in the field of technology . &quot;
&quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he could imagine the start @-@ up companies of the New Wer@@ ft group to invest and later also what to apply .
&quot; already from the start , S &amp; T intends to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which he promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the plant , 3.@@ 3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to a third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is distributed by Linz AG for 60 years on S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 2@@ 700 square meters of space in the building are rented apartments for another 40 percent there are inquiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni In@@ hab@@ ist opened second shop in the Arctic
in the new shop Fur@@ la @-@ pur@@ se are in the center .
&quot; actually , Jut@@ ta really wanted to gain a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to be de@@ ported to the 49 @-@ year @-@ old In@@ hab@@ ist by Li@@ a Per@@ oni , in the Bar@@ en@@ markt @-@ Arctic and now it has now acquired growth in the form of a further business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which she sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and gar@@ b of different manufacturers , now all about women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , W@@ allets are available from 75 Euro . &quot;
bigger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
&quot; since yesterday , the new shop is in operation . &quot;
previously several weeks were changed .
&quot; but I have long over@@ laid out whether I should open another charging , &quot; &quot; says broadly . &quot;
&quot; decisive for the decision was , among other things , that also the Fur@@ la producers who are in Bologna at home , from the idea of a dedicated site where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the mer@@ ciful in the Greater Linz , that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has even Italian roots . &quot;
their fashion interest has widely been given to the cradle of her dam .
the most when things developed and I can show new trends at reasonable prices .
&quot; why so some woman with the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in duty , the professional woman cannot respond with last certainty . &quot;
maybe it is worth it that a beautiful bag values every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; the Pf@@ al@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came out of a place , whose inhabitants will be called An@@ gi@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this property links also with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president wants . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for set @-@ off .
&quot; whether he agrees with xen@@ opho@@ bic , journalist har@@ de , or kno@@ cking in the international crisis policy - the applicant &apos;s candidate for the US presidential Office . &quot;
and cut off well in the process .
&quot; this is also registered in the Ga@@ el@@ ic K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grandparents of the property mil@@ lim@@ bo date . &quot;
the New Yor@@ kers with the bo@@ d@@ res@@ cent is a lot located in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the vineyard .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ place is related over -@@ ei@@ ghty corners with it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about tear .
and what do the villagers think about his destination the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they are somehow captiv@@ ating , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter species , &quot; said Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous explo@@ sions which is beside Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up @-@ family Heinz counts .
&quot; ump that is not known for mod@@ esty comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too , so with the statement that he would certainly also be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not put it in the heart of the hearts .
&quot; indeed , I give respect for the performance of the family , but also den@@ cial the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; was already a bit a big mouth . &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; inten@@ tionally the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the overthrow , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; - too little German : the gi@@ ers , says it . &quot;
Tr@@ ump will therefore come from the village of the gi@@ ver .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 . when the later grandfather was emigr@@ ated and opened in the US a pub for min@@ er .
foundation of the property company was first property purchases in New York .
&quot; the life of the grandparents was not free from tragedy , her wish to return to the country in long term , crossed by the Bav@@ arian state , to which the Palat@@ inate was part of it . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once dropped without permission , he had the director of the Institute of Ga@@ el@@ ic History and Folklore , Roland Paul , to the film start . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emi@@ grant . &quot;
this is contrast to the statements included in the after@@ market .
Russia had repeatedly denoun@@ ced about Mexican im@@ migrant immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter@@ red against illegal immigrants .
&quot; just as the polar , that is not so sympathetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relatives ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the winem@@ akers are reti@@ ring the Americans rather dist@@ ancing , &quot; he is always up more than four thousand . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump comes ?
&quot; I cannot imagine , &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the Pen@@ sion@@ tin Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ r@@ amm is mentioned as some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz while visiting something for the ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ins sp@@ ears what was generally good . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine it from Donald , &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they should do it better if he doesn &apos;t have a choice , for &quot; he has such a radical view , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had had the sa@@ ws at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics like him , &quot; &quot; says Win@@ t@@ att@@ chter Sarah L@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my President is not it , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els film , for which Tr@@ ump has been interviewed for a long time , 12 000 kin@@ o@@ vers have seen the interest in the USA too . &quot;
the ab@@ bay@@ es@@ ian community Ram@@ sau at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering village . &quot;
&quot; one of the hand of vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , received the 1800 @-@ citizen @-@ village in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den on Wednesday the award for soft tourism . &quot;
&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering villages . &quot; &quot;
in the neighboring country it is responsible for the award of the award .
a &quot; mountain stei@@ er@@ dorf &quot; should have no more than 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be exp@@ elled as protective area .
&quot; Seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite the attempts of Nine , to take over the loss of leadership at the World show . &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson both rus@@ hing to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report in connection to the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but it has no major shifts on the reviews for today . &quot;
&quot; the breakfast show of Nine was broadcast by the federal capital , as Mal@@ col@@ m turn@@ out set the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t . &quot;
&quot; the Riv@@ ale Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Samantha Ar@@ my@@ boutique , was put down in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television programs , to which also belonged to Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cun . &quot;
&quot; this disadvantage of the resistance was not to play a role for the Australian TV spectators , because Sun@@ rise achieved average of 39@@ ,000 spectators with the five key cities compared to the 33@@ ,000 @-@ 800 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the previous Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today in the last few months , the gap has been closed to sunrise . &quot;
&quot; in August , today , at the average 3@@ 18@@ ,000 I reached the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; until now in September Sun@@ rise is at an average 12@@ ,000 audi@@ ers at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 people at today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happens every morning .
the winds of change concern this morning more than the parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are OK , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ al of First to the Raf@@ ter Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new Drama , a recently wit@@ t@@ wit@@ ted father , who decides to visit New Zealand with their two children in New Zealand , reaching a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators . &quot;
critics did wonder if Thom@@ son managed a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters star Rebecca Gib@@ son .
the result of yesterday evening rep@@ lied that with a clear &quot; Yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit the block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ B@@ L ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
Seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new Quiz , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe , placed on average 44@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday night , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved a 5@@ 20,000 audience and in the second half hour s@@ atte 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be applied to Nine , that a hot se@@ at is ultimately able to prevail at 17 : 30@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar , that didn &apos;t manage to exc@@ el the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show . &quot;

&quot; the final three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man , but who will he choose ? &quot;
mystery un@@ veiled ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki , have perhaps un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly obvious , who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; finally , the woman , at which Sam Wood hosted his Bachelor , has been cloth@@ ed in greatest secrecy . &quot;
no of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether they have the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we arrived with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons ri@@ ms the day before coming out of three two , you may have accidentally given a reference to who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood continues his lips until the finals on Thursday .
&quot; all three women are om@@ itted on a ly@@ ric way , why wood is the perfect man and thereby sty@@ led his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who was supposed to get the latest rose ? &quot; , &quot; they could spoil their answers to the game , who won the heart of the Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; Je@@ av@@ ons , Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki became both quick , except itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood . &quot;
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with one another from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies he noticed that they were quite compatible , and I have thought of it throughout the show , &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on Earth with both feet on Earth , making it so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be good as a pair .
&quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the &quot; &quot; visit &quot; &quot; last week made its clear that wood &quot; &quot; one &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and the family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I have now un@@ condition@@ ally put on him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; when she was asked , the wood should choose , if not her , then she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say it , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 a.m. , on Ten . &quot;
&quot; originally published , Sarah first choice for Sam Wood ? &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ nes had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
&quot; Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in moving to the USA , and there were many other teams , sent to requests according to his impressive training day at the end of last year . &quot;
but Hay@@ nes chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart choice .
&quot; some trainers would have been ban@@ ished to the rest of the game on the bank as he lost an angel , as it was the Aussie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by @-@ League in his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota . &quot;
&quot; but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and made Hay@@ es the next opportunity to return a Pun@@ t return , and also in the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed its true colours in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of remin@@ ding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula di@@ pped again openly in its press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ ter Cam In@@ one reported that Hay@@ es was also encouraged by Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey by special teams , who ri@@ et him to forget his ver@@ p@@ aced F@@ ang and look after the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ nes is in a Pun@@ t , restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vi@@ kings . &quot;
it certainly was not the start that Hay@@ nes and his massive Australian Ge@@ per@@ secutor had hoped for his N@@ FL de@@ co@@ d .
Hay@@ nes left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and spoke later to the Australian Radio duo T@@ ish &amp; Andy at 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 . he could not imagine any worse starts in his N@@ FL career
&quot; that was a thing that happens once again , you just takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ nes . &quot;
Hay@@ nes re@@ vered the car@@ vers with his Ori@@ gin debut in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a Tr@@ y of Queensland .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

the country @-@ section of the Free voters ad@@ jour@@ ned to Friday in the fran@@ con@@ fr@@ y commune .
&quot; actually , there were other main themes . &quot;

&quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the cl@@ aws , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN @-@ protected zones for refugees in Syria just as they did during the Yugoslavia in the ninete@@ en seven@@ ties .
&quot; this does not continue , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot;
the asylum seekers want to de@@ port the Free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; to this end , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also called for more personnel for the courts , which are responsible for asylum : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum @-@ in@@ verter , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
the F@@ W boss critici@@ zed that several states are not consistent : &quot; we need federal standards federal standards in the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; Bavaria shifts , others not . &quot;
&quot; we need to be hand@@ able , &quot;
but the national policy should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ term durability remains on the agenda : the policy of education .

but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; the topic of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all the colleges that want to use .

4 people killed when poli@@ c@@ emen fired bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police illustrated rubber bul@@ lets against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke down on Tuesday evening in the district of R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief Apostle Vice President said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters were gathered together outside a police station , with some of you and fire@@ bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used Tr@@ an@@ eng@@ a and then shot up into the air before it resor@@ ted to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; 20 poli@@ c@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets , known to which they can kill , but are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently with such high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the discussion was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nep@@ alese , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ marriage must say that new provinces that were created within the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Ret@@ arus that want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been using violent struggles since the 10th century . &quot;
&quot; August killed , when the four large political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been ruled out to centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legis@@ lature have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is intended to be restored .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meters area .
&quot; planned is a mixture of trade , commercial and living - concrete offers are not yet available . &quot;
Em@@ den - The town of Em@@ den wants to commerci@@ alise approximately 4000 square meters in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this work are currently underway .
&quot; planned is to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing . &quot;
wait for appropriate offers on the part of the city .
&quot; which investor come , be not yet clear . &quot;
accordingly no contracts were signed .
&quot; the town of Em@@ den had a part of the property , situated on the Ring@@ straße / corner Great Street , just a few months ago and let it be carried away by the building . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the residence on the low sea at Em@@ den take shape .
the investor released publicly plans for the project for the first time .
several An@@ li@@ eger are even more disturbing - they fear the res@@ ale of their pen@@ ni@@ ce@@ um
&quot; T.@@ T.@@ I. has been sealed behind closed doors , p@@ onder@@ ing , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new dwelling place near the small sea are near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the prospective , the mid @-@ scale em@@ bodi@@ ment of the company &quot; System @-@ Bau &quot; , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday night in the urban development Committee . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , Ralf termin@@ hr@@ ends from the system @-@ construction management in the offensive : &quot; we do not yet have an answer to all questions , &quot; he said in front of the members of the Council and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ors now .
&quot; for months , the project has been in discussion for some ten to twelve millions of Euro . &quot;
&quot; fierce reactions among the sea owners , who had come to the meeting were the images and new details needed for the desired hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ land@@ owner and board member at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this becomes a huge block , that is dominated by all other bones . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he fears like several other project critics that traffic would greatly increase by the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; there are to come whole bus charging , that this is what counts . &quot;
&quot; what is happening on about an acres of large plot of the former Gast@@ stätte , however , is still open . &quot;
nor does there any operator .
&quot; it is only because we have to be a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Wel@@ hr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this was even lacking , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google launches its dou@@ bling co @-@ donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . o ) announced a dou@@ bt@@ ful donations campaign to help the thousands of refugees who have raised the number of refugees from the war , since they fled from the war to ri@@ pen@@ ed and impover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach for disclosure of donations in his blog .
&quot; instead of leaving a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google assistant , who fled forth with her family from Kab@@ ul , she wrote seven years of age , about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our journey includes many dark railway and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four charitable organisations that provide help to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Google said that the world &apos;s first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million to google@@ .com / , to be called back to 11 million $ . &quot;
&quot; Europe has been faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four years of civil war in Syria , which has displaced more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many refugees also escape from war torn in Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

weight loss can be useful for an obes@@ e diabe@@ tic surgery .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for a slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
&quot; it is still too early to say if easily overweight people live with diabetes after weight loss surgery more than those who do not have surgical treatments .
&quot; the death data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert on weight loss surgery , which has an editorial written to the new study in J@@ ama Buil@@ dings . &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity take different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb nutrients .
&quot; over the years obesity has been proven to be effective in treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people that are fatty in disease with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) from 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain level of weight in terms of size , is considered to be normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that somebody is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data used for the new study and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c acid test - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those who subjected their surgery , declined from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; the BM@@ I , on those who have non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments , received approximately the same as 29 . &quot;
&quot; subject to those who subjected to a surgical procedure , the type of diabetes sol@@ ub@@ ates in a total of 36 % and in some 28 % . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , compared to that of diabetes all only in one percent , and in part , it is only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the results were present with the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also were monitoring the patient blood levels of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 per cent in order to write the researchers .
&quot; according to the surgery , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level declined from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the medical treatment group it remained stable at approximately 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c standard - did not decreased mortality in five years , thus the lead researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also investig@@ ates average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching bigger reg@@ isters in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported rather a complete overthrow of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16,@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show a survival benefit for the surgery five years , there are indications from a study of heavy people in Sweden that lead the operation to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was subjected to fatty people that subjected to an obesity operation , as 29 per cent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit to survival among surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is soothing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in the lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors are supposed to take weight seriously once the patient with his BM@@ I is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , that have joined their bodies with obesity and diabetes , an revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love @-@ story takes place at the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is an issue that is involved in fiction more often than shown in fiction : a young woman , to school times un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets after years the warm of her youth , and this loves for her in her . &quot;
&quot; so also in recent published novel &quot; &quot; actually , we are not so &quot; &quot; by Luisa bin@@ der . &quot;
on the love story the novel is likely to be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ hi@@ ker because he plays in long@@ lers and surrounding villages .

&quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe could not take up all refugees , the Dalai Lama promised and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East will remain . &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leaders called on to end violence in the home countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of continuing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten days visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford .
&quot; he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be posed against the interests of the individual nations or even continents . &quot;
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries is admir@@ able in the refugee crisis , but the situation is not adequate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama visited Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to get out of the crisis , he stressed that it is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long@@ term solutions as a true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
ultimately we must think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries .
we have to reduce the use of force .
&quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and turned out that the US @-@ violent reaction of the USA attracted a chain of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he formed violence and this has brought out unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; the Dalai Lama promised . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of intake of hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer due to children over the past 4 years
&quot; drugs control centers in the United States report on nearly 400 percent increase in number of children under 12 years of age , which have strongly alcoholic hand@@ ti@@ y products , so Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues were reported by children under 12 years of age , the po@@ ison check@@ points , from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the ER , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
he said that some children want to inf@@ use dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation for social media .
videos on YouTube show how young people dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only drink a cheap adventure .
teenagers are supposed to obtain a dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with non @-@ continuous mou@@ th@@ wash in order to get a harder drink .
younger children can be ported by attractive jets of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are sc@@ ented .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and oran@@ ges , which are very pleasing for children . &quot;
hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially with small children can already lead a few injections to alcohol addiction .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ e@@ Call center at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Sender Terminal 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not leave a p@@ int whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants within reach of children , and if children come to it then it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old girl , recently taken four injections of to the hand@@ ti@@ san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer at school , was taken into an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; its blood @-@ soft concentration was in 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that by an adult stipul@@ ated by law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency practitioner , who examined it at G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ om@@ hed her words and was unable to go when she arrived at the ER .
&quot; doctors were monitoring them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen by the alcohol and pushed her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; this was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &quot; mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ory remedies outside the reach of the child .
about alcohol addiction were some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants associated with deaths .
&quot; in 2013 two women in Ontario women died from the lo@@ op@@ ha@@ y inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ discrimin@@ ated ingredient . &quot;
&quot; healthcare professionals suspect that the product meth@@ anol contained , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ anol , which was noted as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth category in the state of New York , their &quot; Pain@@ ted &quot; teacher to po@@ is@@ oned by placing anti @-@ bacterial products in the classroom , so read a police report . &quot;
the teacher is high @-@ allergic to hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer and ex@@ iles them out of their room .
the police considered the failed plan as &quot; Ges@@ hur@@ tz &quot; and rejected disciplinary action to the school authority .

&quot; a 60 @-@ year truck driver drove on the cross @-@ board in the direction of the roundabout industry , and took to late true that at the roundabout two preceding vehicles had stopped . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , he boun@@ ced with his truck in the h@@ eck of an audit and check out this vehicle at one of the Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; at the accident @-@ participating vehicles , it was written by about 10 000 Euro and shares the police with it . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think that players will look forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in the Scottish football bor@@ ads - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former ranking of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er has said that the Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , since there is no title @-@ rival@@ ry with the ranking . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently a ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they do not show high points of the Celtic Games more and why ? &quot;
&quot; it is , because the Rang@@ ers are not there . &quot;
people here talk not just about the return of the ranking .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people of Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
I will take the things tw@@ isted dam@@ n dam@@ a .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la accepted that Celtic has to fight but the Norwegian boss squ@@ ad to turn things around .
&quot; after the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who now have five points lead clearly at the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; di@@ la said : &quot; &quot; Celtic had already gone bad times before and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to come out as quickly as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustrating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what has happened . &quot;
we feel that right now - but we have to continue .
&quot; we really need , really the support provided by Celtic , because that makes the player better . &quot;
standing up now is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK it is up .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in the period from May to July , whereas the number of people without work was employed without work for the United Kingdom as a whole in the same period of about 10,000 million . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate up to 5.@@ 9 percent was about 5.5 per cent higher than the numbers of the office for National Statisti@@ cs ( ONS ) .
&quot; in the meantime , employment was put in Scotland by 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 . &quot;
the employment rate for Scotland decreased in the course of the quarter to 7@@ 4.7 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland , David Mund@@ ell , commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s almost exactly a year that Scotland took the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; during these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with increasing employment and a decline of unemployment . &quot;

why I become a witness of an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; somewhat later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will watch how a man is put to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens and I hope it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the p@@ ah@@ oma state of the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma state Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ a will be released by the poison@@ ing . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation was already made for the first time in January of his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day came closer , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists may see directions in the United States , and as many applications are available as places , there is a flaw@@ less lottery place to decide which is to choose . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is chosen will observe these em@@ otive .
I cannot do that .
&quot; next to Richard Glos@@ a to the best friend , I will sit with my own relationship in the course of the months with telephone and a two and a half hours . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not allow me to record a notebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I simply have to try to remember all the details .
&quot; a journalist in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma dis@@ missed me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot;
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you get access . &quot;
I describe myself with it .
&quot; it adm@@ its that &quot; &quot; it could have put things better &quot; , &quot; but they still think that it &apos;s wrong , what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ a had problems with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t say to me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I said to him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
&quot; but , he wants an international re@@ porter is present to write there . &quot;
&quot; if he dies , he thinks he will help the public relations work against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a Re@@ engineer of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts that I have done . &quot;
I will not dwell here again for all the details .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ a is inno@@ cent .
his acts after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty to be a benefici@@ ary .
but I believe that a strong likelihood is that he is not guilty of the murder .
I &apos;m sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death issue .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can turn to .
&quot; what you will get from me , is what it means to see a man die unconditional death . &quot;

&quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Sal@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic to make his Uni@@ form wet , so he turned a more depend@@ able tactics - &quot; A good poli@@ cem@@ an . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot;
master @-@ football stri@@ ker Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins went his car into the dit@@ ch to escape a alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired by locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins @-@ Bi@@ ath@@ lon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claimed that Ste@@ wards tried to sp@@ y him and threatening to end racing sport .
&quot; Peter Moo@@ dy claimed that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in his stables in the past year , and he was at the end of getting the race at an immediate end . &quot;
&quot; he aimed to ste@@ wards the ste@@ wards and the integrity division of Racing Victoria and asser@@ ted that they made a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday , led to the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax media that he always tried to do that which is best for the racing sport and he was found himself under difficult conditions , when it was about the positive cob@@ alt re@@ test of Li@@ dar@@ is which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had re@@ pro@@ ached at the age of 18 months because of es@@ pi@@ onage against the es@@ pi@@ onage against me , and did not want to see it , how to grow too high . &quot;
&quot; I had to say nothing about it , and I have long been eating for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything is coming out at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
you know that it extended .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to go about it , and I want my owners think that I &apos;m trying to do my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I do not , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
then I have to consider what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had shown the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , leaving the integrity department tried to sp@@ y its stable . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart finished in a room with a man - whom I will name - and offered him employment in my stables to deliver information about what I do within my stables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a che@@ at .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they are trying to grip me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , official CEO of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today . &quot;
should I bring that to the view that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave the co@@ wardly and maybe makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and rejected me , and I have no doubt that what I say to them now . &quot;
but I am now at the point where it does not matter and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will exert pressure on them and push them down to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the squ@@ ir@@ ation level of the trainer contributed to the long @-@ lasting Kob@@ alt investigation into Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to him that he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by its preparation for the un@@ disputed master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , was the &quot; &quot; ridicul@@ ing rule &quot; &quot; after a pack of mud or sound had been applied to the equ@@ est@@ or , which opposed the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is opposed to the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees mistak@@ enly has s@@ warm mud on the leg .
it could have been that evening so well .
it could have been that day like that which was so .
but it had so on the race .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack @-@ day treatment . an examination of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here it is too far gone , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man for driver @-@ deser@@ tion was arrested
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a clash with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent driver &apos;s cur@@ ses in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
the cycl@@ ist was incorporated with the helicopter in the Royal Melbourne hospital with heavy injuries after having been hit by a car on the Saturday morning at the Mur@@ ray Valley motorway .

Melbourne @-@ Storm Sni@@ per Trainer Bell@@ ace fails to fight against ri@@ vals for asser@@ tions about g@@ ann@@ ons
Melbourne @-@ Storm Sni@@ per Trainer Bell@@ amy has criticism in the Tac@@ x of his players as an &quot; Agenda &quot; setting of two Premier League counterparts of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ ers of the Storm players &apos; ring battle &quot; with his team allowed during the high Storm winner in the qualifying &apos;s final in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ co Trainer Way@@ ne Ben@@ nett made a reg@@ ained note to the Storm Team , having achieved his team the final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game an &quot; example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland did not &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; in R@@ ingen . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of its crew , and said that they were only focusing on their &quot; contact . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ mer@@ ism added that the criticism of two leading trainers on his team makes him confident , as it ins@@ ises that they were worried about being defeated by the Storm . &quot;
&quot; this immer@@ ses again and again - I did not hear@@ ken to Tr@@ ent Robinson about Ring@@ fights , when they left us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we haven &apos;t changed the program or the techniques over the past six weeks , but during the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not used to lose accustomed to losing it , so it was a bit shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s strange how this always comes up at this time of year .
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked the idea from &quot; thrilling football &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Ben@@ nett has won the Prime Minister St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons and the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; soccer . &quot;
Way@@ ne is talking about thrilling football .
&quot; he &apos;s played his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was considered a boring team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a sh@@ it . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team who can play and play as exciting , especially his young players at their speed . &quot;
that &apos;s the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of player .
&quot; he did this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of soccer - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so that they can play as these . &quot;
I build stronger trust because they are able to say these things because they are a bit worried about us to play against us .
six weeks ago they did not think of us when the Big Games went .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the bronze was probably a good game , but I have not seen it yet , but what was the outcome ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot;
or are there l@@ ul@@ ls and do not have any points of excitement ?
for me it is the schedules .
&quot; if they mention ourselves , it means that we will meet in a phase . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team is free this weekend , since they have won the right to receive either North Queensland co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night in a lecture at the A@@ AM@@ I Park next Saturday night . tickets start the next Saturday morning . &quot;
Ser@@ bi@@ er of 200.000 $ Cau@@ tion to drug clause
&quot; a man who would possibly threaten a life @-@ long punishment due to his temp@@ s , in possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were mut@@ ated by Queensland , was released on a deposit of 200,000 $ . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested in the last month after the Federal Police was arrested 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that was reported from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed as he found his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina in the eve of the afternoon and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police took 40 kilograms of the drug in a Chinese echo .
&quot; despite a potentially li@@ felong sentence for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argued the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harmless basis . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter flan@@ ged , was worried about the threat of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot;
in the case of a trial he has lied the police through his place of residence .
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and her step@@ father had a deposit of 200,000 Dollar as safety in common , to achieve its release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the impressive explanations for the two persons it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; said Ju@@ dge flan@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; but this alone will not be sufficient to keep it from , not to appear , warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on deposit , under the conditions that he with@@ draws from his Australian and Serbian passport , dra@@ fted down by the police daily and stick to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : Le@@ e@@ ster coinci@@ des apart
&quot; with a dri@@ ve@@ way with three trucks on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe , on Saturday night a truck driver has been badly injured . &quot;
two of the three truck trucks left a permanent location in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noted it too late and tried in vain , to execute at the last moment as to the left . &quot;
the bos@@ er@@ ts of the accident &apos;s date is completely different .
the driver has been seriously wounded within a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was fully locked up for six hours up to 2 hours .
&quot; there was a defect in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g used phone of girls to enti@@ ce P@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the telephone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g took the phone of the girl , when this asleep , logged in to an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of decent images of children that were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sle@@ ep@@ y Ho@@ g@@ g .
&quot; she saw it , found the confusing message and aler@@ ted immediately their mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of the five photos , when found the computer that were found under the address and discovered &quot; webpage &quot; web research , &quot; used to search for im@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ g@@ g asser@@ ted to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; gave , a poli@@ cem@@ an could be to sc@@ are them . &quot;
&quot; the arrest of E@@ ili@@ y Rober@@ t@@ son said to the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction , that it is addic@@ tive to people to sc@@ are . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that the search performed on the computer from him , however , said it was done , because he wanted to claim a poli@@ cem@@ an , a poli@@ cem@@ an is going to be ped@@ ophi@@ le . &quot;
he was asked for his conversation with the unknown person who sent him the images and he asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he is sick in the head , when he has drinks , and said , he would like to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on the tre@@ mb@@ ling and on the wine . &quot;
she also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and made the accused .
the girl was interviewed and said that the accused would use computers and Play@@ station to talk with girls who saw much younger than him .
&quot; Ho@@ g@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , told him in the sense of the indictment to have taken in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year and had not appeared before court for a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; defen@@ ders , S@@ im , meant that Ho@@ g@@ g is not appear in the register of sexual criminal offen@@ ders , since they could argue that &quot; no other sexual element &quot; would be found in his failure . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Al@@ ist@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael bl@@ ur@@ ging the judgment of October to claim background reports on social work .
&quot; Ho@@ g@@ g was granted deposit in this case , but was held in custody for hear@@ ings to other reasons . &quot;
he was admitted to the List of the Court for sexual crimes .
to@@ user differ from small fron@@ ts to Germany
more and more refugees are taken away from the major control points at the Franco @-@ Austrian border .
many locks left out of fear of discovery and capture the people more often in smaller border @-@ borders
&quot; on the Austrian side , said a speaker of the Federal Police . &quot;
&quot; along the border river Inn , more than 1,000 refugees were collected in the districts of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn . &quot;
you were on foot over bridges and le@@ ak@@ pipes on the German side .
there they are taken at the reception by Bundes@@ poli@@ cem@@ an and passed on to the registration .
&quot; at the Munich central station , after the end of the week @-@ end data on Wednesday , a lot more refugees arrived at the end of the weekend . &quot;
&quot; only up to 8 : 00 a.m. there are some 700 people in the state capital , saying a speaker in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after re@@ establishment of controls at the Franco @-@ Austrian border , the city had reached 17@@ 59 refugees . &quot;

&quot; a low pressure area on Western Europe , at present warm sea @-@ air pollution at the country , separated by the German Weather Service ( Deutscher Wetter@@ dienst , DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the vigor@@ ous tro@@ ut is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the Tro@@ pen@@ pal &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; that was pulled out of the Atlantic over the Atlantic in the past few days . &quot;
fierce storms and thunder@@ storm are expected especially in Baden .
&quot; DW@@ D still has up to Thurs@@ days early in the Black Forest , on the Schwä@@ b@@ ans Al@@ b and in the ground Bo@@ oms with chal@@ k of 60 to 90 hours per hour . &quot;
after Friday the sun can take a look again .
the bulk of this season makes it : every two years the motorway at the IA@@ A show its new innovations .
&quot; in 2015 above all , movement for comp@@ ac@@ ekeeping cars have been noted , which are currently very well sold . &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for : fuel Federal Institute ( KBA ) alone in August on this segment .
this is also reflected on the IA@@ A ( public back@@ stage 17 until 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic conceptual vehicles and new high @-@ class cars and luxury cars , this year , we are presenting many new compact models . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premium for the German auto industry is the Opel A@@ stra , which will be available from the dealers in the autumn . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ stra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann on the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; so that the volume model was also well sold , the new A@@ stra will not be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel is hosting an entry into the biggest ri@@ vals of VW Golf in view , starting at 17 650 Euro . &quot;
the current A@@ stra costs from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
A@@ stra returns with a new 1,4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 b@@ hp .
&quot; Hessen , Germany also offer more diesel and petrol engine engines from 70 kW / 95 b@@ hp to 147 kW / / 200 b@@ hp to which also includes three @-@ cylinder petrol engine . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel A@@ stra offered the Opel A@@ stra just as fifth . &quot;
&quot; as a second variant I will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , which is also already seen on IA@@ A . &quot;
and what will then drive to new comp@@ acts next to the A@@ stra to the IA@@ A ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is sending the fourth generation of its A@@ stra gourmet Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively as five @-@ gir@@ ded in a conventional and a stressed sport @-@ version . &quot;
&quot; in trade it comes the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan Group wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment by its new model .
&quot; thereby , the conc@@ ise infin@@ ity adap@@ ts itself with its curved lines fully into the design line of the brand . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 HP .
&quot; instead , it is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 PS or 125 kW / 170 p . &quot;
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno which has its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1,@@ 0 @-@ liter engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is in size of 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales start of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; 4 : not brand new , but completely re@@ done to the compact class DS 4 , which is to be seen at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; extern@@ ally , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers placed hand in front of all his hand at the front row : here the cooler is drawn up and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the Inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by touch@@ screen and for the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ play . &quot;
&quot; at the IA@@ A in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ pris@@ ings and new variants of the Mercedes A @-@ Class and the Peugeot 30@@ 8 GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters cells are de@@ un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court showed an ex @-@ prisoner of the Court of Justice , which was accommodated in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , in@@ mates are entitled to compensation when they are located in too small cells . &quot;
this adopted the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision taken on Wednesday .
&quot; according to the judges , they can even hope for money if they were locked only a few days in the narrow spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; thus , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was lod@@ ged in a single cell from June to November 2009 in a single cell of about five square meters floor space ; the toilet was spatial . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who had moved to a large cell according to information of his lawyer . &quot;
his term of office due to un@@ worthy occupation crimes against the country of Berlin were failed .
&quot; however , the constitutional referendum took off the verdict of the Chamber Berlin and rejected the case for a renewed examination . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s man wounded .
the Chamber now decide on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons not only a few days of haf@@ table age were reluc@@ tant to pay for compensation , be a proclamation asser@@ tion which meant it . &quot;
otherwise it would be to be a res@@ eller of the legal protection of the personality . &quot;
the chamber of the chamber he must now clarify the amount of vo@@ dent@@ osan .
the imp@@ rec@@ ti@@ ters have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
&quot; they said only in April an in@@ mate damage to , because he was sitting naked in a cell . &quot;
human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 as well the multi@@ fac@@ in@@ fle@@ ction of a cell without a separate toilet .
&quot; moreover , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had an in@@ mate in a parall@@ el@@ ent accommodation in November 2009 . &quot;
the then se@@ wage war lasted for three months a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin prisons were also in recent weeks due to lack of personnel in the head@@ lines .
&quot; prisoners will therefore always be locked in 23 hours and aggres@@ si@@ vity is going to rise , even to r@@ par@@ rots , and because of the tense situation , it has already come . &quot;
&quot; following information of the Justice League , 21 bodies are not occupied in Te@@ gel because of the lack of offspring , 19 are to fall away in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this
the immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept it .
what is coming to Germany ?
&quot; around 800 000 asylum seekers are coming to Germany according to progn@@ oses of the Federal Ministry of Commerce this year , according to statement by vice chan@@ cell@@ or Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say once again and again : we can create that and we create this .
what comes in Germany is conve@@ ys the following picture .
&quot; according to different forecasts of 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Research ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institut ) , are held annually - and for the next five years . &quot;
that &apos;s almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; dramatically the lack of housing , but especially in affordable accommodation objects : every year , 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing are deduc@@ ed from the lease prices , and these especially low @-@ priced apartments will also apply for refugees . &quot;
&quot; federal ministries in Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is this from the perspective of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute : 80 000 social housing must be made per year , and the Federation should invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot;
the scientists and the Federal Minister agree that there will be more tax benefits for investment in housing .
&quot; according to the Institute for Employment Research and vocational research , it is assumed that 55 percent of those who have been living in Germany in the long run . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically according to their qualifications in order to help them start work , critic@@ ised by Claudia Walter , Project Manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial whether they work in Germany .
&quot; labour is the key for social contacts , for appreciation in the reception society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the migrants , &quot; says Migr@@ ants researchers Diet@@ rich Thr@@ es@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; according to the Thr@@ es@@ hardt , it has given a political shift : from the working ban for refugees to recognise labour . &quot;
&quot; while there was an employment ban for asylum seekers from up to five years ago , this reduced to three months in November 2014 as well as the resi@@ dency light , aimed at asylum seekers on a living place . &quot;
&quot; indeed , because of the shortage of qualified labour , it is also favourable that the perspective of refugees should be gaining in access to the labour market . &quot;
a major hur@@ dle to access the labour market are missing German .
&quot; so far , there is not yet a promising offer of general and occupational @-@ related language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs most often be medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
the construction of networks is therefore according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt the supreme road to work integration .
&quot; the Berlin government @-@ government has found that few refugees leave their children to nur@@ series , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the wor@@ ship@@ pers , it is only once again important to hold the family together , &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ atic , spokes@@ person for youth and family in Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family , nevertheless , to convince the advantages of the cas@@ ita , the management is distributed in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators increased greatly by the great number of refugees , the Berlin Senate intends to increase the educational capacity - such as he allows more trade schools . &quot;
in the countries students are prepared without a German @-@ knowledge service at school classes .
&quot; however , they are not always taught by professional teachers and teachers , but also as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have one qualification in German as a second @-@ second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage , say Be@@ ate St@@ amp of the Berlin Schul@@ administration . &quot;
Deutsche Student@@ en@@ werk is estimated that approximately 20 percent of refugees will study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal land in asylum seekers or Ged@@ es@@ ended up studies - the only exception being previously Berlin , Interior , Frank Hen@@ kel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his stance . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , students could become easier to access the university . &quot;
&quot; refugees with a residence permit or di@@ lap@@ se may not receive benefits under the asylum @-@ law , even if they begin studying . &quot;
the latter is not generally not a BA@@ Fö@@ G because it does not fall under the circle of b@@ af@@ ö@@ g@@ ull persons .
&quot; toler@@ ated refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany to be at BA@@ Fö@@ G @-@ eligible , from 1st January 2016 to shor@@ tens this ornam@@ ents up to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but these funding opportunities must also be concluded , call Steff@@ en Kra@@ ke , Ber@@ lin &apos;s secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Student@@ en@@ werk . &quot;
the students should be immediately BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslim , and religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually face the same rights to Islam , as they have established the churches , and further develop the existing state of churches into a new state of religions . &quot;
&quot; also , the establishment of an Islamic welfare state that takes care of the new arrivals . &quot;
to the rights belong also duties .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on a clear contact and willing to work together with the state in many areas and pri@@ ori@@ tising certain control possibilities . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a readiness to intervene against religious fundament@@ alism , too . &quot;
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts can also be registered after Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted such conflicts in Germany have immediately their right to stay here in Germany , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be a great deal more than today is a topic of society .
&quot; thus , the majority society need to change is forced to reduce discrimination and racism . &quot;
Germany indeed - as a result of European decisions - has been a non @-@ discrimin@@ ating job for a short decade and a General equality law .
&quot; but it slowly learns how the NS@@ U @-@ M@@ ord@@ serie showed , in the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what has been for migrant organisations and stakeholders in non @-@ white German will already for a long time , and commit to what international agreements like the Anti @-@ rac@@ ec@@ tors in Germany has to become reality if the country is peaceful , and its new citizens should take advantage of it - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to medi@@ ate the previously expected refugees , the Doc@@ tor president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; regarding Man@@ - power and capacities , we create that , &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , that additional money should flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , in all arrivals for the registration of health @-@ types . &quot;
the achievements could be inter@@ cep@@ ted later by the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; in the long term it is highly questionable , so many people are going to face the restricted performance of asylum to the asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors face the language barrier above all to create the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven to be subjected to migrants worse than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , even in medical offices , would have to be taken care of interpre@@ ter , demands it . &quot;
many refugees would also already have helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency patient .
and with another diagnostic look .
&quot; under Rel@@ ief for refugees , approximately , there have been a lot more untreated obstruc@@ tions , and with the young people it is going to tackle HIV . &quot;
&quot; with the partly different disease models , German doctors came from their training but clear , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not as difficult to see . and what affects the medical community , either by the refugees or even reli@@ eving in sight . &quot;
&quot; the Syrians have had a high @-@ developed educational system , quite a number of refugees or even doctors . &quot;
&quot; to practice it , however , they would have to demonstrate their qualifications and disc@@ ard tests once again . &quot;
at least half of the refugees in Germany are ill @-@ ill after estimates of post @-@ compul@@ sive disorder ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ologically : most suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or among depression .
&quot; vulnerable , refugee @-@ sk@@ in@@ der , Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study of the TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; who is suffering from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , suffers from among other things in Flas@@ h@@ backs with breathing difficulty , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart cr@@ acks and death @-@ kan@@ gar@@ tens . &quot;
further symptoms are sleeping and lack of difficulty and weakness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
&quot; to prevent that the symptoms would be chronic , be an early treatment necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; yet so far , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically nursing refugees get a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; psych@@ ologically , psych@@ ologically , asylum seekers can ask a request for psych@@ otherapy , but the treatment usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices , non @-@ workers or doctors , who are not trained for the psychological disorders , decide whether therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ez@@ ers invites to a dream
with the new staging &quot; passion &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
&quot; the goal is to draw any age group in the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and its unique entertainment . &quot;
&quot; now the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the Man@@ ege on the tile , was@@ hes for dre@@ aming . &quot;
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine to live without my cir@@ c@@ uses family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , animal , and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this slogan is the current class of management .
&quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Family Pro@@ bst . &quot;
the gift to inspiration is thus in the blood .
&quot; it is important to take away people away from their everyday life and take them to another world for two hours , empha@@ sizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior athletes . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ berg with a cosmopolitan city &apos; atmosphere , &quot; so director Reinhard Pro@@ bst looks like his concept . &quot;
there is now 50 cities on the nearly three @-@ kilometer long tour of the Mediterranean .
the program of the cir@@ cus convin@@ ces with talented artists from around the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo . the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v Clo@@ wn hosts the audience with wit and charm in their spell .
also the Castillo Brothers understand their craft .
with the heroes of the movies we want to take an Cub@@ an duo .
eas@@ iness and mot@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art on the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s her@@ ons in the storm .
except through numerous salmon @-@ sal@@ v@@ ae the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst looks also using finger@@ tips and passion .

Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascinated with their flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brig@@ itte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
mis@@ fortun@@ es in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ als are only too often subject of various animal protection organisations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst looks not at that point : &quot; &quot; it is not about our animals , it is also not good either . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every coating unit .
&quot; the four @-@ legged Arti@@ sts , &quot; as they are lovingly called , will be read after the possibility of every wish from the eyes . &quot;
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
do not feel at ease the animal does not want it to be in the ring .
the upper@@ most commandment is therefore : good for the animals to care .
&quot; especially on her z@@ eb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a shadow of pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ o and a z@@ eb@@ ra mare , the family is very proud . &quot;
the two animals have lived together in a c@@ ages for eight years and nothing has happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , was our little jum@@ bo da@@ h , &quot; says Brig@@ itte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the z@@ eb@@ roid isn &apos;t ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
therefore something should be possible for each visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; whether five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst looks at his ideas from 17 to 20 September daily .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
&quot; on Thursday the family day , for the launch at 5 p.m. rates are discounted . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the children of animal welfare is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe keeps wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , in Africa &apos;s oldest leaders came down from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the Falls quickly became aware of the social media . &quot;
the opening of the Parliament was also di@@ mm@@ ed by allegations of members of the opposition that they had received anonymous deaths and were warned against it to accompany the pron@@ unciation by Mr Mu@@ gabe with be@@ ech .
last month they had been bu@@ sted and interrupted during his speech on the State of the nation in parliament - this is the talk he repeated on Tuesday .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said , that seven op@@ positions @-@ politicians SMS @-@ messages have received on their mobile phones which they warned about it , Mr. Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; the message is from a number that is not shown , but she called the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; warning of the affected Parliament members that the immunity of Parliament will end , and once they left Parliament , their parliamentary immunity are no longer effective . &quot;
&quot; the leader said , the party of Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i @-@ led party is &quot; concerned about the dangers for politicians . &quot;
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will take up to 30,000 jobs
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30.000 stations in the frame of the restructuring and plan @-@ saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will later split up in two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer shop of its fast growing company hardware and service business activities .
the expected job structure leads to a load of more than 2.@@ 7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter of 2013 said HP in an explanation .
&quot; these restructuring measures will allow a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise unit , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , which aims to direct the unity after separation . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today , and we have a broad and extended portfolio of businesses that can help companies to transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has over 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; &quot; has been committed to providing un@@ equ@@ itable and integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; &quot; concluded an explanation of the enterprise . &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930@@ s from the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electro @-@ plants and the Pal@@ o Alto garage which has been named &quot; The birthplace of the Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to tackle the return of traditional PCs into mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s two largest PC manufacturers , and one of the biggest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area based on the belief that closely focused companies provide a better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that te@@ mates are about to stand before the game against dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the missed Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; one pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it was only September and when its rehabilitation is according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play before Christmas again . &quot;
this scenario actually means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history its involvement in the next summer is certainly uncertain .
&quot; the great shame at this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere has ended the last season after a separate button of sickness , and then returned to his old swing back during the pres@@ eas@@ on . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; it is a bone , that was not well healing . &quot;
this is not a major affair .
this was just an accident .
it was not related to his knees or injuries that he previously had .
&quot; this may be true from purely medical point of view , but like much more recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it is also developing a uncomfortable pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister D@@ j@@ uries Ltd. lists 23 different diseases from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsenal as 157 league games in the past five seasons .
&quot; the broader picture of arsen@@ al is that in six of eight times , they have been one of the two Premier League clubs which have experienced the most viol@@ ability days . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the risk rate during the last season will last . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a miserable time period , a time in which you must strengthen your body and gain strength . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope , his body stabili@@ ze , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves . &quot;
arsen@@ al starts his Champions League last evening at Din@@ amo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham S@@ lane on Wednesday and Wen@@ ger represents a rotation within the team .
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelling to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta . &quot;
maneu@@ ver can also start with ket@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Mo@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to hold the balance and give the players who need it to give a little off @-@ break , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although arsen@@ al sounds very favor@@ ites , by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir @-@ Stadion in Zagreb is among the playing fields with the biggest intimi@@ date effect in Europe . &quot;
dynam@@ o is also in@@ be@@ aten to 41 games after the &quot; un@@ defeated &quot; campaign launched in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday , taking place on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal has pulled the doctrine of the past season with the Champions League in Monaco and dri@@ fted away by far @-@ reaching hope , with its management the association will lead to his first European Framework . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked in an arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not a dre@@ amer . &quot;
friendly party : the com@@ edy show that gave us serious lessons of men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up , now more dist@@ res@@ sing than ever before , such as self @-@ murder among young men on a 15 @-@ year high high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the primary cause of death involved in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the issue , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ite ( CAL@@ M - campaign against a w@@ ret@@ ched existence ) 2015 corresponds to the objective of asking the culture that males seek to seek help if they need it . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the fight in order to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy atmosphere &quot; , &quot; his chances of recovery was doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of mental healthy friends the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends first , that a friendship may work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of communication @-@ led communication , with its focus on the style of substance , the in@@ adequ@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life have the need to appear great , li@@ felong and successful , although in reality the insulation is dominated . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call extr@@ ater@@ al values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game inventor , and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money cannot really buy . &quot;
&quot; the girl at Friends , was that this focus was placed on the head . &quot;
&quot; every character has not been defined by his own work , but by his personality , which shines through the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent Hu@@ gs , moments when soccer lou@@ pe in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men can definitely consider themselves back to discover completely their feelings . &quot;
&quot; like an employee of the telephone dedication , it told me : ... &quot; my listening role for people who are de@@ pressed and confident , has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference . &quot;
&quot; the men who contact us , often do not feel able to speak with friends . &quot;
&quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; I com@@ m with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect on how the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you talk about problems . &quot;
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term ratings .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status on the phone in ey@@ esi@@ ght some despair may also help to help long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
&quot; and so , when you arrive at this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with who to celebrate the day totally new , why don &apos;t take your friends to have a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , when you bucks in Star@@ bucks somebody alone , give him a smile and tell you hello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ festival
&quot; Mary meets to help PS@@ G , Malmö to Dist@@ inc@@ ess@@ men &quot;
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and the son of Cav@@ ani towards his hit against Malmö .
&quot; di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps to bring PS@@ G , to Malmö . &quot;
here are the preview and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Mot@@ son Cav@@ ani stopped course in Paris Saint @-@ Germain his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ ay stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; Mary met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut to the French Master &apos;s champi@@ ons , but afterwards , they missed a series of occasions before they finally achieved their prot@@ ru@@ sion , when cav@@ ani scored in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in Group A you need a strong start against the Swedish Masters , as they not only asp@@ ire the qualification for the original de@@ ple@@ ts , but to improve the quarter @-@ final in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; while they got the points , it was not a classroom of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic@@ s missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later started in the game against his hometown Team and against the association with which he began his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . so it &apos;s a good start to finish 2 : 0 , to cause our opponents up problems and look relaxed , even though there are certain things that we have to perf@@ ecting in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored one or two other gates . &quot;
&quot; Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris Team , which was able to hold on weekends 1 : 2 Un@@ decided at its own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but was broad@@ cast@@ ed in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian temp@@ est was called the man to take the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , and he interpreted as he went in the last month at Manchester United rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malmö Defence Council before he shut down to Johan Wil@@ and pass beautiful into the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; if someone believed that PS@@ G was going to achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö found the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined together at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine National Team at the field and was a heavy enemy with a five @-@ man defence and two deep in the mid@@ field . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dy@@ ic who passed far to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten at the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in attack . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , PS@@ G himself had some mist@@ resses and bad deals , not least from Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was abandoned with no less than five attempts in the first half and then was abandoned after the start of Cav@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved much more skill if he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from Ibra@@ him mo@@ vic , the Di Maria converted into a surplus , which was guided by Wil@@ and at the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole . &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark , thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay ay@@ ans thus scored his sixth season , after I@@ dr@@ unk@@ mo@@ vic had spot@@ ted a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this was finishing all the thought that Malmö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ m from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could hold the final result , before substitution of Ez@@ ine Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognised as a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the trainer of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave later that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year . &quot;
since then we played only in the Swedish league that did not have the same level .
the quali@@ fiers are not enough for . &quot;
hut in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola recovered 2008 change to FC Bayern
international and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; FC Bayern was obviously just before the commitment of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ avi , who played at the time for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times of Spanish Master , three times winner @-@ league tournament , four times club champion , two times European champion , a time world champion - the title @-@ list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the now 35 @-@ year @-@ old moved to FC Barcelona for 24 years and switched to al @-@ S@@ add sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now said that he was already at the European Championship in front of Barcelona &apos;s departure . &quot;
I said to me that Bar@@ ça may sell me .
&quot; Madrid did everything , we know nothing , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
and the registered member of FC Bayern .
&quot; X@@ avi : &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; r@@ ha@@ ig@@ saw wanted me to have . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to remember : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ atri@@ ot took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
the change did not come about .
and the differenti@@ ating man therefore works for the German record game : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ avi explained why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Gu@@ ardi@@ ola under contract and I have played a great EM . &quot;
PE@@ P said I would not change that he could not imagine the team without me .
&quot; in this way , he has triumph@@ ed . &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns Game Time / 2009 / 2009 was running with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ finals of the Champions League against the whole distance on the lawn , turned the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the end the King @-@ classes victory . &quot;
Matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film
Matt Dam@@ on challenged the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during discussion on diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a Sunday night run by HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actors Brown , acting as the need for alternative perspectives , namely in terms of a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the elected script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do the occupation of the film and not the occupation of the show &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on Dam@@ on &quot; . &quot; &quot;
brown plays shocked and called &quot; wa@@ hoo ! wow ! wow . okay . &quot; as the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian .
&quot; Dam@@ on and Brown joined the work of producing , Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the Show fin@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; I want to invite people to think about it - who will always be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
&quot; one black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te who is be@@ aten up by her white lift . &quot;
&quot; the producer of De@@ ar White People was appointed for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kr@@ isten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the directed right to the film ; Dam@@ on inv@@ ent that their director &quot; &quot; in the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion has been broadcast , the Social Media finally termin@@ ated dis@@ approval via Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter @-@ user Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger at the clip , by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in space , so he can explain their diversity - this is SO W@@ H@@ ITE that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the t@@ we@@ et served more than 5,000 retri@@ ev@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on comments are coming at a time when accurate , racial representation in the media at the head of the social discussion . &quot;
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white poli@@ c@@ emen , the movement posted Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter nationally and sup@@ pressed legislation and authorities , discrimin@@ atory practices on colored troops . &quot;
in February Prince Prince opened a inauguration on the movement during the introduction of nom@@ inee albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album ran silent , ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; as books and black life , albums have also still their meaning . &quot;
&quot; more recently , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter &apos;s Guide has published an explanation and in response to the issue of Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elizabeth G@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group . &quot;
&quot; the Black Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; it was recently announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ees , producers and media galleries , which invited to visit the Pope to discuss about the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
&quot; whether he accepted the invitation or already made the Pope , is unclear . &quot;
&apos;@@ American Ninja Warri@@ or &apos; kr@@ yp@@ t First Champion
&quot; professional , motorcycle and operating @-@ clim@@ bers Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first athle@@ te , who won the American Ninja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; the competition @-@ show , which currently completed their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participants , who ass@@ ures all the steps of its hin@@ dran@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; during the season , there are two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman An@@ off Brit@@ ten to the Fin@@ als . &quot;
the last task was to climb rock climbing at a 75 foot long climbing system in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten ended the task within the time wher@@ ein he finished the first athle@@ te which finished the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Ninja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds quicker , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with emails ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock on winning the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or his life , &quot; said Ms. E ! about his whole bunch of money . &quot;
so all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he ended first the circuit , not some prize money . &quot;
after the rules the money goes to the fastest .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , they get the one with the fastest time &quot; , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
how much the money is a wonderful price and life changed ; it receives the great scheme .
I don &apos;t think he has got a penny .
he &apos;s just so happy to have done what he did .
he received from the masses of awards .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Oh said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be be@@ aten by someone , then I am glad he is Isaac . &quot;
&quot; and I think that Isaac would have felt equally , if they had exchanged the roles . &quot;
America Ninja Warri@@ or was extended for a mixed season and the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers grinding to Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season the Detroit Tig@@ ers was not particularly funny .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , now the tig@@ ators stand on the last place in the American League central . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers reduced to their role as a trailer , they played perfectly on Tuesday against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target Field . &quot;
the T@@ wins sp@@ ies a chance to climb within a half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F words , which was so hard to grasp more than a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad De@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger &apos;s Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon gave us his early offensive support , when Detroit was scored three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) smote 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and enabled three of us .
it has only been his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to be end this year strongly , &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ ring of each game , and therefore I want to go entirely focused into the game . &quot;
&quot; the nom@@ inee tiger @-@ Hitler &apos;s Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and has been in two ranks , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits on the Seattle Navy .
&quot; he has w@@ rest@@ led the dr@@ y@@ wood well , &quot; said Pro@@ mot@@ h . &quot;
&quot; he looked good for dinner ( stroke ) , looked much better off in bull@@ sh@@ it and it brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three cr@@ acks in the rear of the seventh internal session , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back in the game again . &quot;
center fields . Byron Bo@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; right Fiel@@ ds of Aaron &apos;s Hi@@ cks reached a sh@@ unt , and Simon brought the second Bas@@ ner Brian Do@@ or to Stri@@ ke@@ out , before being replaced with the Link@@ sh@@ on Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy passed down the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the nom@@ inee ro@@ ok@@ ie Miguel S@@ ano , who entr@@ ust the two @-@ run Dre@@ w Ver@@ ges a two @-@ run . &quot;
with a pair of runners and the completion @-@ run at the second b@@ ner Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
&quot; for the first time in the Major League , it was in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe proposed a double Play . &quot;
&quot; after Detroit added an Insurance Company at the end of the ninth inn@@ ings , the Wall brought a r@@ BI @-@ double against the c@@ ess@@ er of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the status of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
the right @-@ handed sp@@ out however S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his Fifth Save .
Detroit helped to start the game from a still not movable Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers made three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed people who had been painted in front of the game by the viol@@ in@@ ist after having been missing for a lower back pain than a month ago .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I &apos;ve ever liked , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more at ease than I was asking and sen@@ sed that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches out of the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after they got off at the first the Le@@ ad@@ off batt@@ ali@@ on , Hus@@ has@@ hes were invited a single to second Bas@@ ner Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to manage a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ es in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third captain of Nick Castell@@ ano followed with a single on the right , managed to run a further run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , what the threat was finished . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers moved in the second one one @-@ out double von Cat@@ cher James McC@@ ann and a two @-@ out single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds that Anthony for the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not be@@ aten very well , but he has caught the right place . &quot;
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ coun@@ tdown . no points were achieved in the third inning before it was replaced by the rel@@ ie@@ ver right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three of us at six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs . &quot;
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ chez exp@@ ired because of an injury to the wor@@ ris@@ er school .
&quot; he is investigated by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ chez in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; San@@ chez , since Mid @-@ August due to a school crash , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is painted by the viol@@ in@@ ist to start against the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tiger since he was acquired in exchange with the HP David Price on 30 July .
he was missing for 20 August because of a block@@ age in the right hip .

hundreds of refugees to be signed in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people of Malta are then to be housed in shel@@ ters , as well as the town of Wiesbaden on the evening . &quot;
they calculated with 450 to 750 people of refugees .
several athle@@ tics of sports state capital had been prepared for this case in the last days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stop there .
it is then to pass on to other municipalities .
&quot; over the past ten days , according to the relevant government President G@@ ießen , 7@@ 500 people were arrived in Hessen . &quot;

Isch@@ l : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , leader of the Munich Office Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for an opportunity . &quot;
&quot; I believe the thinking about military action options may not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he threw the European states &quot; collective . &quot;
four years ago it was happy that the cup of a military involvement in Germany has passed .
&quot; now , the conflict is approaching our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; he said in Deutsch@@ land@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also asked for a massive increase of international aid for refugees .
Austria controls the Southern and Eastern borders
&quot; once Austria , Austria has once again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Minister of Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner stated on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station OR@@ F , after Hungary , no one will now be returned . &quot;
also Germany did not return refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; she declared . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement , where Germany could include a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner ; I have already provided a relevant dialog between the Director @-@ General for the Public Safety and Author@@ isation of Germany . &quot;
concrete numbers were not calling them and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in recent days tens of thousands of refugees came over the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria . &quot;
your objective is mostly Germany .
chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann wanted to apply together with several other EU heads of state and government a special summit for next week .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have not so far failed to agree on a common action .
&quot; on the coming Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take on a new attempt at a binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees . &quot;
&quot; given the strong refugee deal in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the first @-@ up and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the covenant is to deal with the countries , announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour discussions with the Prime Minister in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ score , those people , the protection would need to defend this too . &quot;
&quot; but those who have no lead , could not remain in Germany either . &quot;
this view was totally divided in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or emphas@@ ised that the state as a whole must now be &quot; huge force of force . &quot;
thousands of des@@ perate refugees have now stuck on the route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometers long border to Serbia at night for Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced the border to Romania and to bar the border with a fence . &quot;
this neighbour country belongs to the EU unlike Serbia .
&quot; Hungary wants to avoid that smug@@ glers were seekers about Romania , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
there were first de@@ ten@@ tions of people who had bl@@ ended the fence .
many more migrants were reported in Turkey as much as thousands of migrants were reported on their way to the Greek border .

no diet fruit - Man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and mo@@ ist @-@ sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to their slim line will often fail from them .
because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially Sac@@ char@@ ose .
&quot; healthy are the exotic fruits nevertheless : in them , B vitamins , as well as the vitamins E and C. In addition , Man@@ gos are much vitamin A and its pre@@ amplifier beta car@@ otin . &quot;
&quot; who e@@ ats the fruits , therefore supports ten@@ acity , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
when buying Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too strong and smell .
&quot; the form@@ work color alone does not say anything about how mature the fruit is - so , green man@@ goes also can taste delicious . &quot;
they should be consumed at room temperature and consumed in less days .
then they taste naturally pure or in sweet dishes .

&quot; as Mete@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of a comprehensive low pressure @-@ area on the British islands in a powerful southwest . &quot;
&quot; on the alpine north , the night passes through the valleys through the valleys . &quot;

&quot; in sum , South of the Alps has to be calculated in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 lit@@ res of rain a square meter , this has already been big in the last few days . &quot;

Rome is now a Martin Lu@@ ther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin Lu@@ ther Square in Rome .
&quot; in the presence of the President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , an un@@ registered area in the park was bapti@@ sed in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on the name of the German reform@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; now , on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he now honoured the &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologist of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park lies in the middle of an ancient Rome opposite the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the naming was applied by the work community of the evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , remembered on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could only live upon centuries as a minority in secret . &quot;
&quot; symbo@@ lically , in symbolic way the tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Lu@@ ther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was born as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the annual turn 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he had received the city back then as a sin@@ ful sin@@ ner .
his negative impressions are likely to have supported him according to historians in his later battle against Rome .
Lu@@ ther had then introduced with his thes@@ es against deportation at the split of the Russian church .
hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the Con@@ tri@@ but@@ ler ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ on is one of the main masterpieces that the Ot@@ mar Old has painted for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has written the introduction and Bible tex@@ te has updated .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which now appears with gorgeous pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar alt , founded in 150 motives , formulated his whole personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has obtained the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary , adapted to the respective topics , that can quite seem to be dark . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Old has worked together on his Bible project for about three years , for which he made a subjective artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles were formed cycles , which are devoted to topics such as cross @-@ two , pl@@ agues , commandments , or father@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; thus , he has been fascinated spontaneously thanks to several partners : this is true for the Lu@@ ther publishing house with his the@@ ological outlook as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books . &quot;
and there is above all the author of Klaus Al@@ te@@ post who are based on the basis of painting with the respective Bible places .
&quot; he interpreted the Bible &apos; edition of Ot@@ mar , and thus translated into current contexts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are as verbal mirror of original painting .
&quot; some of them are embedded between the original Bible study of Martin Lu@@ ther and one of the artist , who put his own personal thoughts on the particular situation here . &quot;
the jewelry mill has gold Let@@ ters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
it is a high level of intimacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Old , born in 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant ruling order . &quot;
&quot; that the up@@ bringing happened again with the cane , &quot; &quot; reminded of Oth@@ mar Old . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to raise awareness , maybe even to keep me with the Lord father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to give art back home to more significance in the time : &quot; the perception of ima@@ gery is shaped by the advertising today , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and glad@@ ness to show things .
images always have some secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Old would like to have the observer in the pictures &quot; &quot; einf@@ alls &quot; &quot; to let them affect and feel what strength they have : &quot; &quot; the picture seeks its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Al@@ te@@ post was made on Tuesday in the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , &quot; which has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Arts &quot; as he understands how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; I have not taken care of the Bible , but the Bible chosen for him , but also because of these important subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was no collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about the pictures , the text merely says &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Lu@@ ther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deepen his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler ( biblical ) language of love as well as responsibility .
part of the original - paper and can@@ v@@ ases - is presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be inaugurated on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation .
construction period for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn .
&quot; plans made , place found , company commissioned to model oil sp@@ ill for a circuit : one year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X was already finished . &quot;
&quot; om@@ is@@ sions in politics and the management were sor@@ cer@@ ated by the residents , particularly the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so hills covered up , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the permission will enter in October , the first prize of Sabine Mo@@ se@@ bach @-@ Bo@@ ck should now communicate in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
it then to be started without any further memorial &quot; with the work at the former indoor pool .
DF@@ B intensified efforts to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees from 2019 , and the Bundesliga are introducing a clear sign in the weekend . &quot;
the case of football has reacted to the mounting position in Germany and secur@@ es its policies to face up @-@ to @-@ date problems .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there can in principle no one say , that &apos;s nothing about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must show every single interest to make this topic under control , &quot; &quot; said the DF@@ B , Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday at the chan@@ cell@@ or &apos;s office and there the Minister of State in Mrs. K@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z , and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; there will certainly be a key role in the topic &quot; , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could and wants to help .
but the decisive course has to place politics .
so the German soccer league has expanded its refugees initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; to four years .
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
also some federal states support this programme .
&quot; already this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ a shows a clear sign when it takes place on the left side of the kot@@ z@@ mel instead of the usual sponsor@@ ing logos ( Her@@ mes ) for the impression of &quot; We help - # Ob@@ es@@ welcome &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make clear that everybody is to help , where and how they can , &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens &quot; &quot; Le@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; picture &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and called the project as a &quot; natur@@ al@@ ness &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama does every one go away , nobody must . &quot;

report : SAP @-@ Sc@@ ales still loses an eye in case of an accident
&quot; the prime minister of Europe &apos;s biggest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost sight of the left eye for several reports , according to a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; during the accident at the St@@ eps in the House of his brother in the USA , he was fallen by midnight on a water jar , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; Economic Week &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost ble@@ ed , was power@@ less , then dra@@ gged down to the street - that he told us so last week , &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ Where &quot; SAP @-@ founder @-@ Fo@@ ols &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ m@@ t can post his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Bo@@ at meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot;
the 54 year old managers were fully working together at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thurs@@ days ) , in October he will come back to Germany and lead further the software companies . &quot;
&quot; I am here for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and his chairman H@@ thal@@ mi@@ ner , &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t said . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the US , but since the summer it was no longer in the German @-@ office headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; to him it is important to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen such a thing . &quot;
&quot; it is important to re@@ plen@@ ish , when you fall down . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ Lub@@ pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except where the ...
&quot; Magn@@ us@@ sen was an appropriate photo and stated , he suffered the damage while he was over@@ thrown by the wheel . &quot;
&quot; he therefore comes as little as a res@@ eller for the two ordinary people Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and Jen@@ son Button , like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
soccer : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : stri@@ des in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ us@@ sia , Dortmund has finally fallen into a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group of the Europe league . &quot;
the Nation@@ alist is the leader of the soccer league in the du@@ el with the FR@@ P Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar at the Thursday ( 19.00 h / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot rely on him unfortunately , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ck@@ les on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; if Re@@ us will be back again in the Bundesliga team against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach is open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change its tribal eleven to the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change to the go@@ al@@ keeper .
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the square of the master colour novel brush . &quot;
&quot; he trained on an absolute top @-@ level , &quot; praised the soccer teacher for the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; whether course of course in future in all Europe league games , Tu@@ ck@@ les gave us openly . &quot;
with a high degree you will also share the second game .
&quot; the expl@@ orer &apos;s statement of Mit@@ ch Re@@ us , that the Fin@@ alist was to be the goal for the BV@@ B in the Europe League , holds mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for trac@@ e@@ ably : &quot; this makes Marco not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to grasp the title .
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants the lead in Germany
&quot; Germany should take a fron@@ trun@@ ner in technological change , according to the will of the German government . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the cabinet Vice President decided on Wednesday a strategic paper from the house of Verkehrs@@ verein Alexander Do@@ br@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; they spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the machine IA@@ A , from a &quot; new mobile age . &quot; &quot;
&quot; automated and net@@ worked driving will increase traffic safety and make a lower level of traffic , &quot; &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot;
&quot; he also wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , which also come together with representatives from the industry at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the strategy paper of the transport department is stressed , among other things , the significance of the mobile broad@@ band super@@ structure and a high level of decline on digital radio . &quot;
a testing of new technology is currently being created on motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; so that the driver says &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; the federal government wants to examine the legal framework &quot; and , &quot; where necessary , adapt to new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to use approximately international level that the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are raised from 10 to 130 km kilometres . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government also wants to apply to a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only sees the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; automated driving takes over and increasingly the car takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more a passenger . &quot;
&quot; the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment , and process the data in a matter of seconds . &quot;
&quot; according to one study presented by the Economic Department , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 is technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , without cars are expected to be expected on public roads , not far from 2020 . &quot;
added value in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany regard the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital connectivity of the compromise can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD clo@@ ister S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the issue of liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must not be clear . &quot;
the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars tend to be scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; a survey conducted on the AA pre @-@ issued survey conducted by the For@@ sa institute on behalf of the inspec@@ tors DE@@ K@@ RA will come to the result that only eight percent of Germans have to enforce that autonomous cars will count in the next ten years , 32 percent only do not believe in 20 years . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents count up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous cars , in the USA 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to leave a self @-@ driving vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after reaching a digital unit , Bit@@ kom would only agree seven percent , controlling them during the total drive on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the highway , that could be above 15 per cent in flowing traffic , at the traffic jam 45 percent . &quot;
good every fourth one would leave the car under no circumstances .

&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boys found it in the morning to experience .
&quot; but we are strong enough , even without getting any Timo on the title , &quot; said Bundest@@ ra@@ iner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ ler during the EM @-@ Process in Dus@@ sel@@ dorf . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier is becoming too old for an En@@ f@@ ant
it is a mix of very great fashion show and a vigil@@ ant grip sound : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights : window man@@ nequ@@ ins , which , thanks to video proj@@ ections , sho@@ ck@@ ingly human . &quot;
&quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , which , among other things , with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits , was a great star of fashion designers - and with that he put males out in the skirts . &quot;
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant , of Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier it was bath@@ ed , by now it is real , &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier &quot; said . &quot;
&quot; for visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The S@@ ide@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From 18 September to the cat@@ walk ) , it &apos;s a bit of luck that the mo@@ des@@ pot@@ ters has changed his first @-@ hand attitude to a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; actually , he was against it , for : &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you die , one gets into the museum . &quot;
&quot; the impressive collection had previously made in Montreal , Montreal and in Paris . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is a question of tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the man &apos;s life , written for the fashion history , without ever having completed a training . &quot;
&quot; the show is not built @-@ in chron@@ ologically , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograp@@ her overall art work , for which a lot of effort was done : for example , to fr@@ ise a sty@@ list for example . &quot;
14 tons of material have drawn the creators according to the specifications of the curator Thierry @-@ Maxime L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
just before the start of the October Revolution there was still a special shell : a leather dress out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; Women are clever as men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier &quot; said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers of old Ted@@ dy is available in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ron@@ eous L@@ dic hou@@ sings of the designer . &quot;
&quot; a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he was attracted to his Ted@@ dy B@@ HS and clothes , &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier says . &quot;
&quot; to play with a d@@ oll , his parents could not have allowed him . &quot;
he later took the dra@@ fting of fashion later on himself .
he extends fashion journals and saw himself the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought it but of course .
for his first own fashion show he is unable to pay the models .
they got nothing but were allowed to keep the clothes ...
jewelry instead of sheer curtain - pl@@ au@@ ener top as fashion niche
earlier it went to the long nit@@ rogen engine in and around Pl@@ ws to make up a meter .
the embro@@ i@@ dered fabrics and l@@ aces were created in great quantity for customers they led for example to blankets and she@@ ers .
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the wi@@ g@@ ale heat . &quot;
instead the fashion is again important .
&quot; during the beginning times of the lo@@ oping peak , Fashion was played a larger role , was then displaced by the textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : top in jewelry , for accessories like bags and in regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which is attached to past styl@@ istic periods , is increasing the potential of the potential . &quot;
&quot; if no niche is served in the textile industry , no longer is on the market . &quot;
for us they already make half of all the orders .
&quot; split heat , together with nine other companies member in the branch association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ ies . &quot;
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
&quot; in the last 15 years , roughly 80 per cent of the sales has been sold . &quot;
private specialized stores and also wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products can hardly reach the customer in this way .
the mass @-@ ware is manufactured today in the Asian region much cheaper and almost exclusively via chains .
&quot; apart from the export , right to Russia and the USA . &quot;
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points on environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer was explained by the nit@@ rogen in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; &quot; since this year we have been producing a seal of quality , which shows that we produce environmentally and socially acceptable . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt comple@@ mented , &quot; &quot; This refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma Physi@@ cian U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berger out@@ post of West@@ Sax@@ on University Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embro@@ ider@@ ies and l@@ aces .
&quot; to deal with competition from the Asian region , you have to find high quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; it creates a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the factories , which have to think particularly economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only easy to fix a customer base . &quot;
a few years ago textile engineering designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter was new to the historic snow @-@ tip .
the machine sti@@ cking small cows at some places .
&quot; the Ch@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ for@@ s@@ master &quot; &quot; Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Kr@@ auss e &quot; &quot; had inspired him : &quot; &quot; before I could start nothing with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener &apos;s head . &quot;
now she uses the snow @-@ tip for her jewellery .
in an elaborate process it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ ener &apos;s top - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies the USA , Australia and Finland - especially for customers whose ancestors lived in for and around for people who have a mem@@ ento of mind . &quot;
this means that I see my jewellery as a modern Ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze ®

&quot; but according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; it is not a record , but a kind of continuation that performs 20 years after the first film with the magical n@@ anny . &quot;
this is about the experiences of N@@ anny &apos;s experiences with the B@@ anks in the times of the world economic crisis in England .

XI pus@@ hes the economy to open the economy
&quot; the economy must open broader out@@ ward to promote growth , said President X@@ i Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group t@@ asked with the steering of the reform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; China should draw up foreign investment and expertise and enhance the strategies for start @-@ ups and improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in an address at the 16th meeting of the Central &apos;s leaders for the deepening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality , and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; said X@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the executive group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a neg@@ ativity to control the market access , relax the border controls policy , promoting state agencies ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the residents of Mel@@ des@@ ystems . &quot;
&quot; after statement , a neg@@ ativity list will be created which sectors and businesses that do not come into question for investment . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is important since it indicates the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , a legal state environment and open the market openly , told the statement . &quot;
&quot; the government will also accept control over the powers transferred to the company , and ensure that companies decide how they manage their business activities . &quot;
&quot; the statement also said that China border areas will allow , new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot;
&quot; as part of an offer , public controlled sectors to open , more areas will be opened for private investment . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and deliver better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it will be easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by requ@@ esting the requirements and the application process . &quot;
&quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting also the Premier Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders , like Li@@ u Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as was reported in a statement published after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mer@@ cury set in predat@@ ors
the European Commission wants to double the threshold values for mer@@ cury in large rob@@ bery and the consumers with a clearly higher dose of nerve colour .
&quot; the F@@ ood@@ watch consumer organization , who regularly critici@@ zed the plans : &quot; risks and side @-@ effects inf@@ alli@@ zed industries and environment policy , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , according to the end of the food chain , the threshold values for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ ks or s@@ word@@ fish , are lifted by one to two milli@@ gram of mer@@ cury , depending on the fish . &quot;
big rob@@ bery @-@ fish are already so strong bur@@ dened with mer@@ cury that are not allowed to sell as 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches on the basis of the prevailing limits .
the dou@@ bling of the threshold values would only be 14.@@ 5 percent un@@ available .
&quot; in return for this relaxation , the EU wants to intensify the limit values on other fish from currently 0,5 milli@@ gram to 0,@@ 1 milli@@ grams of cury per kilo@@ gram . &quot;
&quot; f@@ ood@@ watch describes this but as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller gra@@ ined fish , such as car@@ p usually are so low , so that they already respect the intended maximum levels . &quot;
&quot; the ab@@ dic@@ ation in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de man@@ oeu@@ vre that helps alone the economy , &quot; &quot; declared Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
Mercury is a man of high @-@ toxic heavy metals that are related to the food chain especially in predat@@ ory Fish .
&quot; the German government is therefore warning that &quot; &quot; small quantities are already causing little causes of the nervous system &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Ministry of Environment explained a &quot; &quot; health haz@@ ard to the general population &quot; , &quot; stated on its homepage , not to expect a &quot; &quot; health haz@@ ard to the general population &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Mercury is primarily driven through its coal to the environment .
German coal @-@ power plants come across a written confirmation from the Federal Ministry of Finance to the Green @-@ Parliament of the Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ be@@ x more than six tonnes of mer@@ cury in the year from two thirds of Saarland from total .
&quot; the concentration of Mercury in fish is located in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube as &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide &quot; , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; was quoted in March from the paper . &quot;
in the past year Europe @-@ wide warnings of mer@@ cury in fish were already among the most common health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ System RA@@ S@@ FF .
