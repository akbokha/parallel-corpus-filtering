the BI@@ Z could close stand@@ by loan agreement with the central banks of the creditors when banks face a corresponding request .
&quot; the agreements could be paid up to the total amount of the contribution to the mechanism paid by the creditors , namely within a total limits of 2,@@ 7@@ 25 billion units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future generations of the member countries . &quot;
&quot; but now , there are some conditions mentioned below to whose application the BI@@ Z was ready . &quot;
&quot; at any stand@@ by credit , the BC@@ Z would first take over an obligation for two years , whereby the possibility of el@@ ong@@ ated stocks , without being exceeded five years altogether . &quot;
&quot; in the opening of the loans , as well as with its long extended extension the BI@@ Z would calculate a credit @-@ opening fee . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first pulling will not be eff@@ ected before a month after conclusion of the stand@@ by agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liqui@@ dity . &quot;

in the form of a letter between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el and L@@ amm@@ ing
&quot; I honour me , on the recent negotiations between our delegations to establish provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb , and goat meat from Argentina into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organization of sheep and goat meat . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are as follows : &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cool@@ ed h@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb , and goat meat from Argentina will be set to the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in battle @-@ weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to ensure a flaw@@ less functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure that the tot@@ ality resulted in the tot@@ ality the agreed quantity , and executed in accordance with the conventional supply forms ( frozen or cool@@ ed ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the supply form as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement should be informed each other before the introduction of such a change in the number 10 mentioned numbers in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes the protection clause in demand , it is obliged to bear in favour of ensuring that the access from Argentina to the common market is not touched on this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the natives from Argentina will exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the community reserves the right to susp@@ end the natives from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the community ple@@ dged to limit the exhaus@@ tion of the products captured by this agreement to a pole rate of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; when entering new Member States , the community changes in consultation with Argentina , taking number 2 fixed quantity according to the extent of the Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
the in@@ fusion of these new Member States will be determined according to the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this is carried into account under the number of 5 named Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ acker .
&quot; the total amount is set under number 2 , with the day of accession to the Community to 23 000 tons of battle @-@ body weight . &quot;
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development that could affect the marketing of Argent@@ inian H@@ amm@@ el and lam@@ inate on the common market within the agreed amounts .
&quot; in particular , the community takes precautions , in order that the paragraph of interven@@ tion@@ ers on frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation will not under@@ mines the paragraph of Argent@@ in@@ ic H@@ amm@@ el and lamb g@@ amm@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and regulations of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual use of yields or other funding measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lam@@ bs , as well as for the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , only at prices and conditions that are consistent with existing international commitments and take into account the traditional share of community trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are compatible in a manner that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention to the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI , and XX@@ III of general customs and trade agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , this agreement ensures compliance with this agreement , in particular that it has specified amounts of export licenses specified in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the community comm@@ its itself to meet all necessary precautions , so that the distribution of revenue licenses for the above @-@ mentioned products with origin in Argentina is made on the submission of a export license which is designated by the relevant authorities of the Argent@@ in@@ ean government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined so that on the position of a security deposit for the distribution of the in@@ fusion license for the questionable products can be disp@@ ens@@ ed .
&quot; in exchange @-@ regulations , it is said that the responsible Argent@@ in@@ ean authority in the responsible office of the Community were granted in regular intervals the quantities have been issued for the export licenses ; this information may be de@@ ferred according to identification keys . &quot;
the committee bears the concern that the agreement is properly applied and working faul@@ t@@ lessly .
&quot; he regularly reviews the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat market of both parties and on the world market , as well as the sales conditions on these markets including the conditions that are of importance to the number 7 mentioned target . &quot;
&quot; the committee bears the concern that the proper application of this agreement is not affected by this agreement , that products from H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb , and goat meat under the agreement will not be executed . &quot;
the committee discussed all questions regarding the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement are un@@ har@@ med by the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 January .
&quot; the volume of this agreement reached from the beginning of this agreement until 1 . January of the following year , a lot will be determined in relation to the total year and carries the seasonal character of trade . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community , on the one hand , and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; at this time , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party , to cancel it with a notice period of one year in writing . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties before the 1 . April 1984 with regard to changes that it is understandable for necessary . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would like to inform the consent of your government .
I honour me to confirm the input of your present letter with the following words :

the pre@@ standing amounts are carried out in the conventional supply forms ( frozen or cool@@ ed ) .
&quot; the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand should not be prevented from this agreement , to use new technological developments or to maintain its competitive position on the market of the community . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the supply form as a result of changes in technology and in commerce should be possible , so consult the two parties involved in front of such a change in the clause 10 mentioned in clause 10 mentioned in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes the protection clause , it is committed to protecting itself from this agreement to the interests of New Zealand . &quot;

&quot; for the prevention of bacterial growth , the responsible state authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or the supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic used , provided that the re@@ agents with the added substance will continue to use the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;
sera human origin measures must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein @-@ nit@@ rogen per ml of fluid or recur@@ sive ser@@ um .
&quot; re@@ agents , as valid , whether in flu@@ essi@@ mis@@ c form or after the recovery , must be transparent and may not contain any sedi@@ ments nor G@@ ele or visible particles . &quot;
&quot; for international exchange of certain re@@ agents for blood vessels , they are not to be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored , at least as long as it is not until the International Convention has come about a uniform system . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents for blood vessels are to be distributed in such a manner and in such quantities , that in a container are not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control cells . &quot;
&quot; the quantity , which is located in a container must be so great that the content may be used if necessary to carry out the performance tests described in this protocol . &quot;
the manufacturer of manufacturing has over all levels of production and controls of re@@ agents to lead to re@@ group@@ ing written records .
appropriate samples of all selected re@@ agents are to be preserved so long from the Laboratory of Labor@@ atories up until some probability may be accepted that the batch is no longer used .
&quot; the re@@ types of re@@ agents can contain substances of human , animal , herbal ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids for strengthening the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the re@@ agents . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective proportions . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents do not contain any substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; each single container is a black on white printed label in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
