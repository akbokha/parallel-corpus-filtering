&quot; this document is a summary of the European Public Health Committee ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , in which explains the studies conducted by the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package location ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
if you would like further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as a solution to inser@@ tion ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ ling thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder , in which the patients man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high @-@ tuning ) alternat@@ ely with periods of normal mood . &quot;
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat severe to severe Man@@ ic episodes and the prevention of Man@@ ic episodes in patients , who have addressed the drug in the past . &quot;
injection solution is applied to quick control of gest@@ ational anxiety or behavi@@ oral disorders when the or@@ ale intake of the drug is not possible .
both disorders can apply the solution to the inser@@ tion or the melt @-@ coated tablets in patients where the slip of tablets difficulties are prepared .
&quot; in patients who are taking other medicines just like A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose should be adapted to A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells among each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole appears probably mainly as &quot; partial Ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in ( also called ser@@ otonin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole such as 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in and dop@@ amine , but in less dimensions than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters affects the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in play a role in schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole carries to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and their re@@ occur will be prevented . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of al@@ bili@@ fy to prevent the re@@ occur of symptoms , was examined in three studies of up to one year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of the injection solution has been compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schizophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which were compared to increased unrest , over a period of two hours with a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with semi @-@ operated dol , in a different study the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo , which had been stabili@@ zed to 160 patients , in which the Ottoman symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with ax@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of bili@@ cal injection solution was conducted in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which was in gest@@ ed rest@@ lessness , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies the change in the symptoms of patients has been studied by a standard therapy for bi@@ polar disorder , or the number of patients who spoke to treatment languages . &quot;
&quot; the company also led studies through to investigate , how the body absor@@ bs the melt @-@ coated tablets and the solution to the entry . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution showed patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of gest@@ ed anxiety as the patients who received a placebo . &quot;
&quot; when applied to the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ term studies have been more effective than placebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks long more effective than placebo the re @-@ encounter man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients , and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
bili@@ fy injections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms gest@@ ed rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy for inser@@ tion ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ ic pyram@@ idal , vom@@ iting ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , vom@@ iting ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , saliva , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Pharmac@@ euticals ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy , in treating schizophren@@ ia and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients , who had predominantly some man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes responded to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , facing the risks . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of inj@@ ecting solution in the fast control of increased unrest and behavi@@ oral distur@@ ban@@ ces in patients with schizophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes , if an oral therapy is not suitable to prevail over the risks . &quot;
June 2004 shared the European Commission of Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the transport sector of A@@ bili@@ fy throughout the European Union .
&quot; AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients , who had predominantly some man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole languages ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; increased effectiveness in doses on a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients of 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient , a lower Initi@@ al dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duction is set out of the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the appearance of su@@ icide disorders belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and has been reported in some cases after the beginning or the change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
results of an epidemi@@ ologic study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder no increased public risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were compared to other anti@@ psych@@ otic ben@@ zene .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardi@@ ac diseases ( M@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ous disease , her@@ edi@@ tary disease , degra@@ dation disorders , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure ( including ak@@ ach@@ eri@@ ed and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies , which a year or less persistent , there were occasional reports on during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; when with a AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y patients signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esthesia , should be considered to reduce the dose or decrease the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient &apos;s signs and symptoms developed to point to a m@@ n , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ otic , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used in patients with cl@@ amps in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in states that are associated with cl@@ amps , with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients suffering from Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , an increased mortality compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; there was however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the talk for unwanted sh@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ oni or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em com@@ a or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related unwanted events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic medicines , treated with direct comparisons . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored with regard to a deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; a weight increase is generally observed in schizophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , using anti@@ psych@@ otic identi@@ ties , where weight gain is known as side @-@ effect , or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with itself over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ Ant@@ protagonist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a stomach acid blo@@ cker , reduces the rem@@ n@@ apping rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , whereby this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
in a clinical study with healthy promot@@ ers increased a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) the Au@@ c of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole around 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ etine and par@@ ox@@ etine , similar effects have and therefore should be made similar dosage reductions . &quot;
with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans can result the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sion@@ ists .
&quot; if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the potential risks to the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV protein , are likely to have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosage reductions . &quot;
after lowering the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors should be raised the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y at the tin height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ap@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day does not have any significant effect on the met@@ al@@ ates of the sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ methodology morph@@ in@@ an @-@ rati@@ o ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to the insufficient data base for the safety in humans and due to the concerns in the animal studies in pregnancy , this medicine may not be used in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit clearly justi@@ fies the potential risk of the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , even with other anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , patients should be warned that hazardous machines , including power vehicles , to operate until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schizophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients , which were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total of less incidence ( 25@@ ,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ child@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ yst@@ em@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared with patients who were treated with semi @-@ operated dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients suffering from O@@ lan@@ om therapy . &quot;
some episodes of Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS is 2@@ 3.5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.@@ 3 % in patients under semi@@ conductor treatment .
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term development phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ atin @-@ phosph@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of the patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.@@ 0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; about the side @-@ effects which can occur in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and about their occurrence was also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and cr@@ amp@@ hor@@ ny with older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies and since the launch of the market , un@@ intended or inten@@ tional belief with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed only with adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information on the effectiveness of a her@@ c@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ o@@ aly@@ sis is in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefits as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plas@@ tic@@ ine connection . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder regarding the combination of a particip@@ atory effect on dop@@ amine dop@@ amine and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors will be conve@@ yed .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vit@@ ro a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and D@@ 3 recep@@ tor and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recep@@ tor and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for the ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 ep@@ hr@@ ine and to the hist@@ amine H@@ 1 recep@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; in the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses of 0,5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy Pro@@ ban@@ den showed a dose @-@ dependent on the attachment of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 recep@@ tor lig@@ ands , on the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the coup . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schizophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to placebo a statisti@@ cally significant increase of psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in a semi @-@ operated dol @-@ controlled study was 52 the proportion of respon@@ dents of respon@@ dents , who held a response to study medication , in both groups similarly ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and semi @-@ operated dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from Mess@@ sk@@ als , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - depress@@ ants scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ ab@@ om@@ i@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks to stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schizophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction of relap@@ se demonstrated by 34 % in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Group and 57 % among placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ ed in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study with schizophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included and in which the primary study of patients had a weight increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg in an average weight of ca . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with an Ottoman or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole an opposite of placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with an Ottoman or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole against placebo no superior effectiveness .
&quot; in two Plac@@ ebo@@ x and active controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with an Ottoman or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a opposite effect compared to placebo or semi @-@ operated dol of week 12 . &quot;
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also pointed to a similar proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the Man@@ ia , like lithium or semi @-@ operated dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with an Ottoman or bl@@ ended episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially over 2 weeks do not appear to Li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at therapy for therapeu@@ tical symptoms compared to Mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term exp@@ iry phase over 74 weeks in patients , who had attained an re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on placebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar reverse , predominantly in the prevention of a relap@@ se in the Man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vit@@ ro @-@ studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the stretching and hydro@@ xy@@ ding of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ dy is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the middle Eli@@ min@@ ation period is roughly 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with exten@@ sion@@ ists over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and with nearly 14@@ 6 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy promot@@ ers , also showed themselves with a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic examination of schizophren@@ ic patients with no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a think @-@ specific analysis of the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics yiel@@ ded no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in terms of ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ o@@ glob@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy proportions .
&quot; a single dose study in Pro@@ ban@@ den with different eng@@ radi@@ ant liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function to the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study comprised only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ ology , toxicity in repeti@@ tive gift , re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ism , Gen@@ o@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the kan@@ o@@ genic potential left the pre@@ clinical data no particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological effects of significant effects were only observed in doses or expos@@ ures , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure when people are considerably exceeded , so they have limited or no meaning for the clinical use . &quot;
the effects embr@@ aced a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al glands in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to the 3 - to 10@@ times the middle ste@@ ady @-@ state exposure ( Au@@ c ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ m of the middle ste@@ ady @-@ state exposure ( Au@@ c ) at the recommended maxim@@ al@@ d@@ osis in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis has been established as a result of curing sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ z@@ ole ( Au@@ c ) during the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - up to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations in the human G@@ alle at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were no more than 6 % of the concentrations specified in the study of 39 weeks in the casting ( 6 % ) of vit@@ ro sol@@ ub@@ ility . &quot;
&quot; at rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after me@@ tering , which resulted in positions of the 3@@ - and 11@@ times of the middle ste@@ ady @-@ State Au@@ c at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; in analysis of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe depression , a similar effectiveness in relation to the total population has been observed , but a statistical signature could be found due to a decreased patient number . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schizophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( or@@ ally ) compared to placebo a statisti@@ cally significant increase of psych@@ otic symptoms .

&quot; the effectiveness of abra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a main study , at the 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , some of which had previously received an anth@@ rac@@ eutical in earlier . &quot;
the effect of abra@@ x@@ ane ( in some gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el pharmaceutical drug ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
&quot; in total , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated patients on treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients , the conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el included medicine . &quot;
one regards only the patients who have been treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer indicators as time to worsen@@ ing of disease and survival no difference between medicines .
&quot; on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer in terms of these indicators , that the x@@ ane was more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el included . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be applied to patients who are silent , or before the start of the treatment of low ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood . &quot;
the Committee for Pharmac@@ euticals ( CH@@ MP ) noted that the first treatment was no longer proposing to reduce more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el diseases and that unlike other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs do not have to be given with other medicines to decrease side effects .
January 2008 the European Commission awarded the Company Bio@@ Science Limited received a permit for the transport of abra@@ x@@ ane in the whole of the European Union .

&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should be immediately set off and symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient should not be treated again with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients , no new abra@@ sive treatment cycles should be initiated until the ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ers increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ mbo@@ genic number rose again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ sive .
&quot; while an un@@ ambiguous with my@@ x@@ ane in connection with cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven , kar@@ di@@ ous incidents in the inde@@ xed patient collective does not uncommon , especially in patients with younger anth@@ rac@@ ers in treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease . &quot;

abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side @-@ effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( common ) which can affect the transport system and the ability to serve machines .
&quot; below are the most common and most important incidents of side @-@ effects listed in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer , which were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 . &quot;
Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity ( with 79 % of patients reported ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dos@@ is@@ depending ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ie was reported at 71 % of the patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ B &lt; 10 g / d@@ l ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with abra@@ sive patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ B &lt; 8 g / d@@ l ) .
&quot; in table 1 are the side effects listed , which occurred in conjunction with the gift of abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) . &quot;
&quot; very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) . &quot;

p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules active ingredient that promotes the mer@@ ging of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ les from the tu@@ b@@ ular cor@@ es and stabili@@ zed the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by the im@@ itation of their Dep@@ ol@@ y@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ul@@ ary network that is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ ine conve@@ ys the Trans@@ zy@@ t@@ osis of plasma @-@ components into the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ m cells and in the frame of in @-@ vit@@ ro studies has been proven that the presence of Alb@@ ula promotes the transport of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ m cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ dot@@ hel@@ i@@ ale transport will be conve@@ yed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ kin recipes and is due to the al@@ b@@ umin@@ escence Prot@@ eins SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumor .
&quot; the application of abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ cardi@@ ac is supported by the data of 106 patients in two single @-@ voice uni@@ denti@@ ated studies and of 4@@ 54 patients , which were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III study study . &quot;
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer has been treated with abra@@ x@@ ane which was given in the form of in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 can be used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer .
&quot; this multi @-@ centric study was carried out in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer , either in the form of soluble P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , either in the form of soluble P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , either in the form of sol@@ vent 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion with no pre@@ fix ( N = 2@@ 29 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study in the study , 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % only had an adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of met@@ abo@@ asi@@ fication and 19 % due to met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 The results for the general reference rate and time up to the progression of the disease , and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First @-@ line treatment are shown below . &quot;
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving a degree of patients suffering from a time during therapy a peri@@ ph@@ ere N@@ europ@@ athy degrees 3 were evaluated .
the natural course of peripher@@ al N@@ europ@@ athy for the end to Bas@@ eline due to cum@@ ulative toxicity of abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .

&quot; 10 After intraven@@ ous gift of abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation took place in a multi@@ ph@@ as@@ hic way . &quot;
&quot; the mean branch volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume refers to a wide @-@ reaching , trav@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or past@@ ure connection of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 . it is compared to the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
the Clear@@ ance of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the my@@ x@@ ane @-@ gift higher ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ vent hal@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection and also the distribution volume was higher in abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
&quot; in the published literature on in @-@ vit@@ ro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissues , P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is reported in first line to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) . &quot;
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 , the mid@@ value for cum@@ ulated ur@@ inary tract from the given total dose was less than 1 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the met@@ abol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching clearing clearing . &quot;
&quot; however , more than 3 patients aged over 75 years are only available , since only 3 patients of these age group participated in pharmac@@ o@@ cr@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;

member states must ensure that the owner of the approval for the transport sector are provided before the market launch of the medical personnel in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail outlets containing the following information and materials :
• training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medication by means of identification and package . • With a clear image representation of the correct application of the product @-@ looking cooling boxes for transport through the patient .
&quot; this means that it is similar to a biological medicine , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; &quot; Refer@@ ences &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood pressure , in which to occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications , if the procedure is not possible before the procedure is not possible , and in which a loss of loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with se@@ is@@ amed has to be initiated under the supervision of a doctor , the experience in the treatment of patients with disease has to be indicated for which the drug is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own bleeding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein . &quot;
injection can also be made from the patient or its supervis@@ ors provided they have received an appropriate instructions .
patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients suffering from chemotherapy should always be at the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ ites in adults respectively between 9.@@ 5 and 11 g / d@@ l with children ) .
the iron values of all patients are before treating the treatment to ensure that no iron lack exists and iron supplements should be administered during the whole treatment .
&quot; in patients who receive chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems can be caused by a er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency or thereby , that the body is not sufficient to the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used to increase surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
&quot; it is produced from a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
se@@ amed amed as an injection in a v@@ ein as part of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study were inj@@ ected at least eight weeks E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ein before they were either ported to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ es between the beginning of the study and the trial period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; the company also presented the results of a study , in which the effects caused by the skin with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients were examined , which received an chemotherapy reg@@ imen . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving patients caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ es of patients , who were placed on se@@ amed amed , were maintained in the same degree as in those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / d@@ l of the starting value of 12.@@ 0 g / d@@ l . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) like sudden , ste@@ aling migr@@ atory headaches and con@@ fu@@ tility . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or one of the other components .
se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this is caused by no allergic reactions .
&quot; the Committee for Pharmac@@ euticals ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the provisions of the European Union , the drug has produced a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company , providing Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information about the medical personnel in all Member States information , including information on the security of the drug . &quot;
August 2007 shared the European Commission Medi@@ ce Drugs P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg a permit for the transport of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the European Union .

in clinical trials an increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events have been observed ( ESA ) with a hem@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ - target @-@ concentration of over 12 g / d@@ l ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical trials have not shown any significant benefit that is due to the gift of epo@@ et@@ ins if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ al@@ centr@@ ation is increased on the concentration of concentration symptoms and the avoidance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ an@@ rose should be approximately 1 g / d@@ l ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / d@@ l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of high blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evi@@ di@@ enter coron@@ ary heart failure or in@@ suffici@@ ency should be exceeded during maintenance therapy , which will not be exceeded under Section 4.2 recommended upper limit of the tick @-@ glob@@ in target . &quot;
&quot; according to the present knowledge , by the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ zed , the progression of kidney failure is not accelerated . &quot;
patients under chemotherapy should be considered a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa @-@ Gift and the er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ B increase is greater than 2 g / d@@ l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) a month or a H@@ B value of 13 g / d@@ l ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) must minimize the dose under Section 4.2 to keep the risk of potential thro@@ at@@ ographic events ( see Section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ ically @-@ related an@@ emia - dosage adjustment between 10 g / d@@ l and 12 g / d@@ l ) .
&quot; the decision for applying re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ching should be based on a benefit of patients , which should also be based on the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are intended for a greater electric orthop@@ edic surgery , if possible , before the beginning of the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a greater electric orthop@@ edic surgery should obtain an adequate Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ se@@ pro@@ phyla@@ xis , since they have an increased risk of thro@@ po@@ unding and vas@@ cular diseases , especially with an underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it may not be excluded that in the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting @-@ mo@@ glo@@ om value of &gt; 13 g / d@@ l may consist of increased risk of post @-@ surgical / vas@@ cular events . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , it was not proven that they improve overall survival associated with symptom@@ atic an@@ emia , or reduce the risk of tum@@ our . &quot;

&quot; in vit@@ ro @-@ investigations on tum@@ ors , there are no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation . &quot;
&quot; thro@@ po@@ unding , vas@@ cular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dinal ar@@ rests , m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ous , cerebral hem@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ osis and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys , has been reported in patients under Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common side effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ ton@@ ia .
an increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vas@@ cular events ( see section 4.@@ 4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .

&quot; survival and progression were examined in five great controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were dou@@ bling plac@@ ings controlled , and &quot;
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in the overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients and the control patient . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients with an an@@ a@@ emia due to various common mal@@ ign@@ ancies @-@ resistant an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality than in controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and related complications in with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ oid poe@@ tin patients and controls satisfac@@ tor@@ ily .
&quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bol@@ ical events in tum@@ our patients , who are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant humanitarian er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on the overall survival can not be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are treated to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in patients , who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of transferring a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in under 13 g / d@@ l , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the over@@ checked data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa provisions after repeti@@ tive intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ time period of about 4 hours at healthy promot@@ ers and a somewhat prolonged half @-@ time period of about 5 hours in patients with kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; according to sub@@ cut@@ aneous injections , the ser@@ um levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the ser@@ um levels , which will be reached by intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no cum@@ ulation : the ser@@ um levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift , or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;

a high tick @-@ bell bin@@ ds worth the risk to problems with the heart or the blood vessels and the mortality rate could be increased .
&quot; in case of increased or increasing cali@@ ber , your doctor can consider a break of the treatment with se@@ is@@ amed , until the potassium values are back in norm@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney sc@@ aff@@ lu@@ ous and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary heart disease or storage signs due to insufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your tick level has not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present knowledge of these findings , through the treatment of blood poverty with chronic kidney failure ( kidney failure ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ zed , the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency is not accelerated . &quot;
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ Gift and the desired effect should be taken into account for assessing the effectiveness of se@@ is@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood pressure ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your se@@ amed dose accordingly to keep the risk of a blood circulation ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ anic event ) as possible .
&quot; this risk should be wei@@ ghed very carefully against the benefits arising from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , in particular if you have an increased risk of thro@@ at@@ onic vas@@ cular events , for example , if you have an increased risk of thro@@ at@@ onic vas@@ cular events ( e.g. a deep Ven@@ en@@ thro@@ mb@@ osis or pneum@@ em@@ bo@@ lie ) in the past . &quot;
&quot; if you are a cancer patient , consider that Ab@@ se@@ amed as a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can adver@@ sely affect the tumor . &quot;
&quot; if there is a greater orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , it should be investigated before treatment begins with Ab@@ se@@ amed the cause of your an@@ emia and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood @-@ offs ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed as an increased risk of blood circulation after the surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or applied / applied recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you are Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means for repression of the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor will possibly prescri@@ be certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory studies have no inter@@ play between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are funds to build the immune system , for example in cancer , chemotherapy or HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your blood poverty ( an@@ a@@ emia ) speaks to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor will possibly arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment &apos;s success and ensure that the drug works properly and your tick @-@ bell value does not sur@@ pass a certain value .
&quot; once you are well adjusted , you will receive regular doses from Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 / kg twice weekly , distributed to two equally large injections . &quot;

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after the men@@ opause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ tional risk ( bone break@@ through@@ s ) , including patients who have recently suffered a low trau@@ matic shell like when falling down ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get ought to take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should obtain a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injection in a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( funds against inflammation ) just after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce the symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headaches . &quot;
for treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
&quot; since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is like in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta was used to assess A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in the first study nearly 8 000 older women involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it has been studied the number of spine and hip tours over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study comprised 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which had recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; it was examined the number of frac@@ tures for a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the efficacy was , whether the salary of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ates in ser@@ um ( an enzyme that builds up the bone substance ) in the blood , or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of spinal cord in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) has been reduced by 70 % over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis , with those on placebo , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving men and women with hips , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
the most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common in repeti@@ tive in@@ fusion .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against customs acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other components .
&quot; as with all Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate patients in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are subject to patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to the risk of kidney disease , reactions to in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( die of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a puts prescri@@ ptions for doctors prepared to prescri@@ be the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as the medication to apply , as well as similar material for patients where the drug side effects are explained and pointed out when they should turn to the doctor . &quot;

&quot; for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic boun@@ ties , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the guardian ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
&quot; after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long emission period has been observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to ensure ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic boun@@ ties , an Initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. or@@ ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first a@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of symptoms resulting in the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by the Gift of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
patients with kidney disease disorder ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) In patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient group .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary , as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and young people A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and young people under 18 years of age because data is missing and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because for these patient population only limited clinical experiences .
an existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is before the start of therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid adjustment of the effect of customs acid on the bone structure , it can develop a temporary , sometimes with symptom@@ atic hypo@@ cr@@ emia , its maximum usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; additionally , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to ensure ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , poor mouth hygiene ) should be used in front of an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dental examination using appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental attacks , no data is available whether the interruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the j@@ aw area . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the responsible physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms resulting in the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by the Gift of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of considered serious side @-@ effect reported cases of accus@@ ations was in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients , the placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( P@@ FT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall prevalence of allegations between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.@@ 6 % ) and placebo ( 2,@@ 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , undes@@ irable pharmaceutical effects are listed in table 1 . &quot;
kidney @-@ dys@@ functions with kidney dys@@ functions was associated with kidney functions ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ( annually prior to administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure were compared with oste@@ opor@@ osis in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis as well as three years comparable to the a@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after gift was observed at 1.8 % of the patients treated to 0.@@ 8 % of the patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of laboratory studies , the temporary as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values marked in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study treated patients compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies treated patients . &quot;
&quot; all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study for the prevention of clinical frac@@ tures after a recently exp@@ elled ridge , the vitamin D mirror was not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however , the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of Zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid in a large clinical study has been reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reports ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the j@@ aw area was occasionally found , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the max@@ il@@ field ) reported with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , including customs acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs for local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks . &quot;
7 study with 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients joined oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in the max@@ il@@ field at one with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and with a placebo @-@ treated patients .
&quot; in case of an over@@ dose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , can be achieved by a gift of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium @-@ glu@@ con@@ at . &quot;
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( P@@ FT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown with either a bone @-@ value or a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ score for the Schen@@ kel@@ h@@ as &lt; -@@ 2,5 with or without signs of an existing spinal cord .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated patients aged 75 and older had increased 60 % reduced risk of fat compounds compared to placebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0,@@ 00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a showed an equal effect over three years , which resulted in a reduction of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; effect on the bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a raised the bone density at the cervi@@ cal acid , r@@ ump and the dist@@ al radius compared to the placebo treatment significantly to all time points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;

bone hist@@ ology With 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ ic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken a year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies of the pelvic fireplace .
a micro@@ computer@@ ised - ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to placebo an increase in the tra@@ ine@@ cular bone structure and the preservation of the traditional bone architecture .

the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dosage A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months was significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP has been significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the starting @-@ value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ X was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the starting @-@ value up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D mirror were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received a beginners dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
the total poli@@ c@@ ality was at 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .

the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment carried out over 24 months as compared to the placebo treatment to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % at the total th@@ ig@@ h and around 4.3 % at the Schengen area .
clinical effectiveness in men in H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ized with 50@@ 8 men and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % against placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M2@@ 30@@ 8 ) was the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to the once weekly gift of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate related to percentage change in the steering wheel BM@@ D after 24 months in comparison to the starting value .

&quot; 11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg Zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg ris@@ ed@@ on@@ ate once daily during 2 months , has been proven in two six months in comparison to two six months . &quot;
&quot; in the combined results , after 6 months a similar decrease of pain and pain points has been observed in comparison to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were classified at the end of six month &apos;s main study as Respon@@ sible ( on the therapy ) could be added to an observation phase .
&quot; from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 with ris@@ ed@@ on@@ ate patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response was reported at 141 of the patients treated with Ris@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared to 71 of the patients with ris@@ ed@@ on@@ ate patients , preserved in a middle duration of the observation period of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes persistent in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg customs acid at 64 patients took the following pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dos@@ is@@ independently . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plastic bars quickly took place on &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of top value . &quot;
rapid organic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ value hours ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a tempor@@ al elimination of elimination of ½ g 14@@ 6 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early verification phases ( α and β , with the above named ½ values ) , probably represent the fast Res@@ or@@ ption of the bone and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose can be found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the overall Clear@@ ance Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains un@@ influenced by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the in@@ fusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of customs clear@@ ance concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation against Time ) . &quot;
&quot; a decreased clear@@ ance of by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ systems metabolic substances is unlikely , because customs acid is not yet met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed when people are not yet met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or no direct and / or irre@@ versi@@ bly , hydrogen @-@ dependent In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patients groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearing of the customs clear@@ ance with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , and was with the 64 studied patients in the average of 84 ± 29 ml / min ( area 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
the result is that a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an excessive kidney disorder up to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min do not require a dosage adjustment of the customs acid .
&quot; as for heavy kidney disorders ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data , there are no statements available to this population . &quot;
acute toxicity The highest non @-@ effective intraven@@ ous dose was in mice 10 mg / kg body weight and in rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in studies of dogs , individual doses of 1,@@ 0 mg / kg ( based on the Au@@ c the 6@@ m of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered for a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influ@@ encing . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intraven@@ ous application has been administered into 3 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to the fold @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg , administered in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to the 7@@ times the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the au@@ c , corresponds ) . &quot;

&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a appears to re@@ alizes the bone structure once more norm@@ alized , thereby providing a normal bone formation and thus gives the bone more strength . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or have to undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; if you use A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use other medicines or have recently been taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor it is especially important to know if you take medicines , of which it is known to the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; when applying A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a along with food and drinks , you are worried that you should take enough liquid under the instructions of your doctor before and after the treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year which is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion to a v@@ ein .

&quot; Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion to a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works for a long time , you may need a further dose only after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions precisely so that the calcium mirror is not too low in your blood in time after in@@ fusion .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can work for longer than one year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
when the administration is missed by A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a Set@@ ting you immediately with your doctor or hospital in connection to arrange a new date .
&quot; prior to ending the therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a if you consider the termination of treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , please take a look at your next doctor &apos;s calendar and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects related to the first in@@ fusion are very common ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but after the subsequent in@@ fusion are less common . &quot;
&quot; fever and coff@@ ers , muscle or joint pain and head@@ ache , occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; currently , it is unclear whether A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you get A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;

&quot; in patients with a recently exp@@ elled low @-@ trau@@ matic boun@@ ties , the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended to take two or more weeks after the operative care of the envelope . &quot;
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , patients must be looked after with liquid ; this is especially important in patients who receive a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid adjustment of the effect of customs acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ cr@@ emia , its maximum usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occurs . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium according to at least twice a day of 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , a starting dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. or@@ ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;

Ac@@ tos are applied to the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( Mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially for overweight patients ) . • It can be applied together with another Di@@ abet@@ es@@ drug medicine ( du@@ alism therapy ) .
&quot; it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially for overweight patients ) , which can be not satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ ic har@@ n@@ ous or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ants or ins@@ ulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced the dose of the sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ants or the ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s ins@@ ulin can be better used in better and the blood sugar level , allowing the type 2 diabetes to adjust better . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of accounts in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ant , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; measured in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ li@@ fied hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which makes it close that the blood sugar increases in the application of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional gift from Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ due value increased by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional gift of placebo for a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of accounts and ins@@ ulin was examined in 2@@ 89 patients , patients , the Ac@@ tos in addition to ins@@ ulin , compared to 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients , which were additionally placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects related to Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( cold cuts ) , weight gain and hypo@@ an@@ esthesia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ ants ) . &quot;
&quot; accounts must not be used in patients , which may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ osis ( high ket@@ one levels - Sä@@ id bars - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited registered a licence for the transport of accounts within the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , curved , and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the in@@ scription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination of ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is inadequate with ins@@ ulin , and in which met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ toler@@ ability is un@@ suitable ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one for patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are endangered by the presence of at least a risk factor ( e.g. previous heart disease or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest possible dose and increase the dose of dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or furn@@ ace , especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and furn@@ aces , when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and existing advanced mac@@ ular disease has been performed .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports of heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output liver enz@@ ym@@ atic ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard ) , or with other signs of liver illness , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one must not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirror increases to 3 @-@ times the upper limit of the standard , the liver enz@@ ym@@ atic values are as soon as possible to control . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that point to an hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , upper bau@@ ch@@ lessness , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or darker har@@ n , are the liver enz@@ ym@@ eric values . &quot;
&quot; the decision whether the treatment of patients continued with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be headed up to the pre@@ tend of the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can be stir@@ red by fats and in some cases associated with hydr@@ ation . &quot;
as a result of a her@@ ul@@ ence the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one entered a slightly reduction of the middle hem@@ o@@ glob@@ es ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.3 % ) .
similar changes were observed in comparative @-@ controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of the hem@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ s by 3 @-@ 4 % and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of the hem@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ s by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.@@ 2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of the increased ulin @-@ sensitivity consists of patients , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as an oral or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ant or as a twin @-@ combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the launch of the market , it was reported under the treatment of Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ on , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , above an occurrence or a deterioration of an anti@@ diabe@@ tic Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms , with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
it is unclear whether there is a direct link between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the appearance of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms if patients report on disorders of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ologic analysis should be considered .
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages in@@ desirable events regarding bone bro@@ o@@ ds from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8.@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ frac@@ ture rate was 1,@@ 9 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated women and 1,@@ 1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study about 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events , questionn@@ aires appeared at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 0.5 % ; 0,5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) with patients , who were treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs , is treating the treatment ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phenol , phenol and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines used by these enzymes , such as oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the au@@ c of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one around the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in lowering the au@@ c of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
&quot; this is due to that , in the treatment of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one that dimin@@ ished in pregnancy and increased ins@@ ulin resistance , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the long@@ ation growth . &quot;
&quot; very frequently &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from this data is not invaluable ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the brake code of the lens as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic drugs .
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ce entered the three @-@ fold the upper limit of the standard in addition , as among the placebo , but less common than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ osis . &quot;
&quot; in a out@@ come study in patients with existing advanced mac@@ vas@@ cular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was by 1.6 % higher than the placebo if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w . &quot;
&quot; since the market launch rarely has been reported via heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , however , if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has been used in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with heart failure in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; it became a summary analysis of messages in@@ desirable events regarding bone bro@@ o@@ zed , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8.@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients with compar@@ atively treated groups . &quot;
&quot; during a period of 3.5 years of ongoing pro@@ active study , questionn@@ aires appeared at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) of the patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) with patients who were treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; taking the highest dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days were no symptoms . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific key prescription ( per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome pro@@ lifer@@ ator Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) to which in the animal model leads to an increased ulin @-@ sensitivity of liver , fats and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripher@@ al glucose level in the event of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for two years to investigate the time up to the end of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,@@ 0 % ) is maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ent controlled study of 12 months , patients , their blood sugar has been inadequate despite three @-@ month optimization of ins@@ ulin , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced the average of 0.@@ 45 % , compared to patients , which continued to ins@@ ulin ; a reduction of ins@@ ulin in the treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on @-@ treated group was observed . &quot;
in clinical trials over a year showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the album by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on through a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the album in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ as compared to the initial values .
the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small group at 18 weeks after the examination of type 2 @-@ diabe@@ tics .
&quot; in most clinical trials , compared to placebo a reduction in the total plasma @-@ tri@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ de and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as neg@@ li@@ gible , though clin@@ ically not significantly increased li@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total plastic gly@@ cem@@ z@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol level . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was not observed a statisti@@ cally significant increase in the L@@ DL cholesterol level , while under met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de dimin@@ ished values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial level , this has an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic absorption as well as the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients were random@@ ised to type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ vas@@ cular disease in groups , in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is rapidly resor@@ bed , whereby the top con@@ centric con@@ centric pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one can usually be reached 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the effectiveness of the effectiveness of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; this studies could be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phenol , phenol and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) or lo@@ wers the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; according to oral application of radio@@ active mark@@ i@@ dered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the mark@@ er was primarily found in the subjects ( 55 % ) and to a lower extent in the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the mean plasma @-@ elimination period of un@@ changing pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans and all active Met@@ abol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; the Plasma Con@@ centr@@ ations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its Met@@ abol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy pro @-@ ban@@ kers , whereby the cr@@ ats of oral Clear@@ ance of mother@@ boards are similar . &quot;
&quot; in toxic@@ ological studies stood in mice , rats , dogs and apes of the coinci@@ ding after repeated administration with hoo@@ ks , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that in the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is reduced in the design of hyper@@ ins@@ ulin and increased ins@@ ulin resistance , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the long@@ ation growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were induc@@ ed in the rat of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( with male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( with male rats ) of the ur@@ inary epitheli@@ um .
in a zo@@ di@@ ac@@ om@@ at@@ ous poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons led to an increased frequency of colon@@ ists .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the in@@ scription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ frac@@ ture rate was 1,@@ 9 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated women and 1,@@ 1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study about 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events , questionn@@ aires appeared at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 0.5 % ; 0,5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) with patients , who were treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
in another study about two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with each pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were examined .
in clinical trials over one year it showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the album by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on through a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the album in / Kre@@ at@@ ine quot@@ as compared to the initial values .
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the so@@ ber @-@ tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial level , this has an effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as to the hep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study was missing the target with respect to its primary end@@ point , which identified a combination of the total poli@@ cem@@ an , non @-@ mortal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dinal , leg of leg , coron@@ ary cul@@ ar@@ isation and re@@ vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arteries , the results suggest that using pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on are not associated with cardiovascular long @-@ term risks . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ ous has been studied in a total of 2@@ 94 patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as can not produce ins@@ ulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is not able to use the ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ li@@ fied hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ ane led to a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , which pointed out that the blood sugar levels were significantly reduced as with a different human@@ ins@@ ulin . &quot;
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ ane should not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human@@ ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; furthermore , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ ous may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is available to the package ) . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ ist Ag@@ ents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ di@@ ans exceeds the risks of diabetes .
October 2002 the European Commission joined Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transport of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ ane in the European Union .
&quot; mixed ins@@ ulin products are usually applied once or twice a day , if a quick initial effect is desired together with a longer lasting effect . &quot;
injections must be under the skin at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar has improved considerably , for example , by an intense ins@@ ulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic war@@ es symptoms can be changed and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , ins@@ ulin ( fast acting , bi@@ ph@@ as@@ ic , long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin , human@@ ins@@ ulin or ins@@ ulin @-@ an@@ alo@@ gon ) and / or production method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA towards ins@@ ulin origin ) can result in achieving a change of dosage is required . &quot;
&quot; if the change to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane is required when the patient is required to receive a dosage adjustment , this can be necessary in the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after a change from animal on human ins@@ ulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia was less pronounced or unlike its previous ins@@ ulin . &quot;

&quot; • Set@@ ting the closing stage again so on the finished pen , that the number 0 is opposite the d@@ osing mark ( figure D ) • chec@@ ker you , whether the button @-@ kno@@ b button down completely . &quot;
&quot; if the button @-@ button can not move freely , ins@@ ulin is pushed out of the injection engine • The scale on the sealing cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 16 , 16 and 18 units . &quot;
&quot; the button @-@ button moves towards the outside , while you turn the sealing cap - the scale below the button ( press button ) displays 20 , 40 and 60 units . &quot;
&quot; 107 • Noti@@ fying the highest number you can see on the button flan@@ k • add the two numbers to get the specified dose • If you have set a wrong dose , turn the closing cap simply for@@ wards or back@@ wards until you have set the right number of units . &quot;
&quot; turn it , until the button kno@@ b down completely down and you can sense a resistance , then take the closing cap and put them back so again that the 0 of the do@@ d@@ osing is opposite . &quot;
make sure to press only during the injection on the button _ button • Ke@@ ep the button @-@ button after injection entirely until the injections of the skin has been pulled out .
&quot; it may possibly be in@@ accurate - you cannot set a dose which is higher than the number of remaining in the cartridge remaining units • You can use the resi@@ men@@ gen@@ sk@@ ala as much ins@@ ulin , but you cannot use them to adjust your dose or select . &quot;

&quot; ► BUY the in@@ no@@ un@@ fu@@ sion@@ ist of ins@@ ulin , when the In@@ no@@ let has been dropped , damaged or crus@@ hed ; it is the risk of exclusion of ins@@ ulin , if it was not correctly stored or frozen ( see 6 How is Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id to keep up ? ) ► If there is not clear how water and colour@@ less looks . &quot;
&quot; let the final cap of your In@@ no@@ let ready @-@ up always set , if it is not in use to protect it from light . &quot;
• Des@@ inf@@ ect the rubber compounds with a medical cloth • ben@@ ding you always for any inj@@ ecting a new injection engine • Scre@@ ening the injections of a Nov@@ o@@ Fine S inj@@ ector ( figure 1@@ A ) • pulling the large outer cap of the injections and the inner cap of the injection needle .
&quot; the tin gler turns on to zero and you will be listening to the client base • The injections must be inj@@ ected at least 6 seconds on the skin , in order to ensure that the complete ins@@ ulin is inj@@ ected during the injection , since the dosage can push to zero when you press the injection rot@@ um after each injection . &quot;

&quot; if one of the listed side effects you may considerably imp@@ airs or you notice side effects which are not specified in this manual information , please inform your doctor , your diet consultant or your pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; let the final cap of your fle@@ x@@ pen is always set up , if it is not in use to protect it from light . &quot;
F Ke@@ ep the Flex@@ pen with the inj@@ ecting needle up and knock a few times a finger easily against the cartridge to get existing bub@@ bles above in the cartridge .
the dose can be corrected both upward and down@@ wards by turning the dosage op@@ tionally in the appropriate direction until the correct dose is facing the mark of the dos@@ is@@ ad .
&quot; Aden@@ ur@@ ic is applied to patients who already have signs of cryst@@ all@@ ings , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or tox@@ ins ( &quot; stones . &quot; ) . greater pri@@ ori@@ ations , which can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ inary storage box is still up to four mg per dec@@ il@@ ites , the dose may be increased to a daily 120 mg twice a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment mon@@ ads can still occur again , therefore , that patients may take at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic , further medicines to contrac@@ eption of gyp@@ sy attacks . &quot;
the drug is not recommended for children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ tation because it was not investigated for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , at the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three of several Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with a placebo ( hypo@@ medi@@ cam@@ ents ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug for treating hypertension ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two dos@@ ages of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared a year on 7@@ 62 patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
&quot; the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients , their ur@@ inary packs in the blood during the last three measurements under 6 mg / d@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients , the aden@@ ur@@ ic occurred in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who once daily took 120 mg , during the last three measurements of the blood of under 6 mg / d@@ l . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was about 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea ( bo@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular , in patients with heart illness , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects which concern the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
the Committee for Pharmac@@ euticals ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the lowering of the ur@@ inary bladder in blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ an@@ a@@ emia in diseases , which have already led to pri@@ mor@@ abl@@ is@@ ations ( including one from the medical history known or currently present of the Gi@@ cht@@ ing and / or a Gi@@ cht@@ arthritis ) . &quot;
if the ser@@ um seeds are still under consideration for 2 @-@ 4 weeks or &gt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) can be considered a dosage increase on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
&quot; in patients with severe kidney disease , the effectiveness and safety so far has not been fully examined ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents , because there are no experience in children and young people , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; organ recei@@ vers As it does not have experience at organ@@ transplan@@ tation , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease For patients with isch@@ a@@ ical heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure is not recommended treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ ant frau@@ dul@@ ent medicines , it can occur during the treatment commen@@ cing to an acute po@@ unding because by lowering the ser@@ um se@@ cular pi@@ eg@@ els first of which the cells can be mobil@@ ised in the tissues . &quot;
&quot; B. in mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases occur so far that it comes to a de@@ pot in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
liver diseases Dur@@ ing the clinical studies of the Phase 3 were slight ti@@ ghtening of liver herbs in patients with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treated patients ( 3.5 % ) .
&quot; it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver functioning before the beginning of the F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ at Z@@ ones were not conducted in@@ efficient studies on F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ or may lead to a rise of The@@ ophy@@ l@@ line @-@ mirror ( a shirt of the Met@@ abol@@ isation of The@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ) was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; at Pro@@ ban@@ den was the simultaneous gift of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and n@@ apro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in the F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ute ( C@@ max 28 % , Au@@ c 41 % and T@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
in clinical trials the application of Nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 @-@ shirts are not related to a clinical significant increase of undes@@ irable events .
col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / in@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without that a dosage adjustment for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient is required .
&quot; in a study carried out 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x a mid 22 % increase in the Au@@ c of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ or effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at to the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an An@@ ta@@ zi@@ du@@ ms , the magnesium @-@ hydro@@ x@@ id and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ id contains , which causes absorption of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease in the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in the au@@ c . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not be close to side effects of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / newborn babies .
&quot; experimental studies cannot be caused by direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful in the taxes of a vehicle , serving from machines or in the exercise of hazardous activities , until they can be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may not be detrimental to their performance . &quot;
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of incidence of the test @-@ coloured events was observed in the total f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ e@@ Group compared to Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the number 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term - long @-@ term studies ( 1,4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) and due to long @-@ term significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be found .
the risk factors in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ kl@@ erotic disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dinal or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 mg F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ) , which in the treatment of 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups a total of more than once , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated simultaneously with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In the clinical trials have not been observed heavy skin attacks or severe hyper@@ sensitive actions . &quot;
&quot; 7 Off@@ ene long @-@ term studies in the open long @-@ term long @-@ term studies have been treated 9@@ 06 patients up to 1 year , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the incidents reported during long @-@ term studies were similar to those in the studies in phase 3 were reported ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment of events have been reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s treatment groups a total of more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long@@ time extensions ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events have been reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 for these cans either at all or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ id@@ emia , in@@ som@@ nia , mort@@ als , whi@@ tish , du@@ alism , protein in@@ suffici@@ ency , erectile dysfunction , kidney failure , kidney disease , decrease in the blood , decrease in the number of white blood cells . &quot;
&quot; operation mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is in humans the final product of the Pur@@ in@@ metabolic ism and is created within the framework of the reac@@ tion@@ as@@ k@@ ade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ure@@ ei@@ c acid . &quot;
&quot; F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a powerful , non @-@ selective In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ X@@ O ) with a K@@ i @-@ value for the in vit@@ ro @-@ shirts , which is located below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area . &quot;
&quot; clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC has been described in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX Study and F@@ act study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
the primary efficacy point was in every study of the percentage of patients where the last three month determined ser@@ um acid levels &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) or Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) or Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ates at the beginning of &gt; 1.5 mg / d@@ l and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed in terms of lowering the ser@@ um bags under 6 mg / d@@ l ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) the statisti@@ cally significant superiority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ act study demonstrated in terms of sustained reduction of ser@@ um seeds under 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) the statisti@@ cally significant superiority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment using the dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg daily .
&quot; patients with ser@@ um Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summar@@ ized to the analyses . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg &quot;
lowering of the ser@@ um seeds on &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit during Week 2 and permanently maintained over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l received 100 mg 1 x daily .
&quot; primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney disease , the AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney disease ( d. h ) . &quot;
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients achieved . &quot;
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in proportion of the percentage of ser@@ um acid @-@ con@@ centric concentrations in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney functions ) .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ mammals re@@ con@@ centric ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of the patients ( AP@@ EX@@ E and F@@ act study ) had a ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ aci@@ dity concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l .
&quot; the data collected in two years in the open exp@@ iry study of Phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients were required in the months 16 @-@ 24 a treatment against a gyp@@ sy ( i.e. , more than 97 % of the patients required any treatment against a gyp@@ sy ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction of the dis@@ junction size , which at 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of the gyp@@ sum up to month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.@@ 8 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; in healthy volunteers , the maximum Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations period ( Au@@ c ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at according to administration is easier and multi @-@ pler doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional . &quot;
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg it is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at an increase in the au@@ c that is greater than the dos@@ is@@ propor@@ tionally increase .
after the intake simple or multi @-@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max about 2.8 @-@ 3.@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.@@ 0 @-@ 5.@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml .
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage fall of ser@@ um acid purification is observed if this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is located in the range of 29 to 75 l after intake of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plas@@ m@@ ap@@ rot@@ tle connection of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is about 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to Alb@@ um@@ ine ) and is reached via the concentration width which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
&quot; in vit@@ ro @-@ studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ nia showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ abol@@ ites is mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ o @-@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id mainly arises through U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose found in the urine as an imm@@ utable F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , whose known oxid@@ ative met@@ abol@@ ites and its Kon@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as another unknown metal di@@ abolic ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of urine , approximately 45 % of the dose found themselves as an imm@@ utable F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , whose known oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ites and its Kon@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as another unknown metal di@@ abolic ( 7 % ) . &quot;

the middle @-@ overall Au@@ c from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at took about the 1.8 @-@ time of 7.5 μ in the group with normal kidney function on 13.@@ 2 μ g in the group with severe kidney function .
&quot; 12 liver care unit , after taking multi @-@ pler doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ - Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) liver function , the C@@ max and Au@@ c of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its met@@ abol@@ ites changed significantly compared to pro@@ ban@@ kers with normal liver function . &quot;
age There have been no significant changes in regard to the Au@@ c of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its met@@ abol@@ ites after taking multi @-@ pler doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ ities and urine @-@ composition and is not relevant for clinical use as a result .
it has been noted that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day does not affect fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats .
&quot; at high doses , which were approximately in 4,@@ 3@@ - times the human therapeutic exposure , maternal toxicity occurred , which went along with a lowering of the performance and a development delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in tra@@ ine@@ ties with ex@@ positions , which carried approximately the 4.@@ 3 @-@ times and with the rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions that carried approximately the 13 @-@ fold of human therapeutic exposure , did not decrease ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease , where the bones are brood ) in women after men@@ opause in which a risk for a low vitamin D mirror exists . &quot;
&quot; the patient has to take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium , and vitam@@ ine supple@@ mentary ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid a irritation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may take up until after the first food intake of the day , the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet should not lie down . &quot;
&quot; as Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from each other in pharmaceuticals , which are approved in the European Union , the Company submitted data to date from earlier studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also led a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase of vitamin D mirror .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients were treated with low vitamin D @-@ level in patients , which were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those with only Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also placed data that indicate that the dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE contained in the AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE dose is exactly the dose which is needed to prevent a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , pain of muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal muscle , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , ul@@ cer@@ ation , di@@ ar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , ul@@ cer@@ ation , di@@ ar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , ul@@ cer , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( b@@ umps ) , ul@@ cer@@ ated abdom@@ en ( lo@@ bites ) , tri@@ mm@@ ed abdom@@ en ( baked belly ) as well as aci@@ dic asc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in patients with et@@ less hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any other components may not be applied AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied with diseases of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who can not stand up or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; Janu@@ ary@@ 2007 , the European Commission gave the company Mer@@ ck Sharp &amp; D@@ oh@@ me Ltd. for approval for the transport of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the tear of a button on the one side and &quot; &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; &quot; on the other . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or taking of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium , and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following indications are to be followed precisely to reduce the risk for ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed up after the day of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not cr@@ ush the tablet or tablet in the mouth , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ ale Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before the first food intake of the day , which should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal blood@@ lines or surgical procedures in the upper gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract from P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tics , are only given in particular care ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; eco @-@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al responses , such as Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sion , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ tures , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these severe and required a hospital instruction ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore be attentive to all signs and symptoms , which are advised on possible ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out when the appearance of symptoms ha@@ ge@@ al irritation like dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gy , pain while lo@@ osing or retro@@ ous pain , or new or deterior@@ ating so@@ cks burn out the medicine and get medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side @-@ effects seems to be increased in patients , which does not take the medication properly , and / or it after the occurrence of symptoms , which refer to a ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation . &quot;
it is very important that all Do@@ ors are to be passed on to patients and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large studied clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on at no higher risk was determined , it was rare ( after market launch ) stomach and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , reports ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the j@@ aw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , has been reported in cancer patients , their therapy regime largely intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to give the clu@@ es whether the ab@@ uses of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients , who require a ortho@@ don@@ or surgical procedure , dimin@@ ished the risk of an oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose from the j@@ aw . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the responsible physician is author@@ itative for therapeutic planning with each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be reli@@ ant to take care of taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the tablet every morning after having noticed its failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the week@@ day . &quot;
other disorders that affect the metabolism of minerals ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should be treated at the beginning of the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE also .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on food and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some oral medicines can interfere with the rem@@ n@@ ants of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients should wait after the intake of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific inter@@ acting studies have not been carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without the clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ depen@@ dencies . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for application in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither to apply during pregnancy nor by breastfeeding women .
animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at leave no indication of directly damaging effects related to pregnancy that recognize the embryonic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the j@@ aw was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ics ; most of the reports come from cancer patients , but also reported at oste@@ opor@@ osis . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they came from Ser@@ um @-@ calcium to &lt; 8,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Ser@@ um@@ - phosph@@ ate to &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;

&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the propag@@ ation of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continues to continue ; even the BM@@ D of the Fem@@ ur@@ hal@@ ses and the entire body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; for two pl@@ az@@ ebo@@ arding studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and subsequently 10 mg daily continues to be taken over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
in this study the daily gift of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the appearance of at least a new vor@@ tex : 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % against placebo 15.@@ 5 % ) .
&quot; Res@@ or@@ ption is based on a intraven@@ ous reference dose , the average oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate for women between 5 and 70 mg after noc@@ tur@@ nal fast@@ ening and two hours before taking a stand@@ ardis@@ ed breakfast . &quot;
the bio@@ availability reduced to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when al@@ en@@ dr@@ on an or half an hour before a stand@@ ardis@@ ed breakfast was taken .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day . &quot;
healthy promot@@ ers conducted the gift of oral Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) to no clin@@ ically significant change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in funding in the range of 20 % to 44 % ) .
&quot; 9 distribution studies on rats have revealed that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on is distributed after intraven@@ ous gift of 1 mg / kg temporarily into past@@ ures , but then quickly spread into bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted out with urine . &quot;
&quot; elimination After intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , approximately 50 % of radio@@ active substance have been retired within 72 hours of urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the subjects . &quot;
&quot; after intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and the systemic Clear@@ ance passes over 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not passed through the sau@@ re or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not accepted when people affected the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines through these transport systems . &quot;

&quot; characteristics in patients pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on , which is not deposited inside the bone , is quickly passed through urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is available in addition , it is nonetheless reck@@ oned that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal try also to be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;

&quot; Ad@@ vag@@ raf is administered adult patients , who was transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver to prevent a rep@@ ell@@ ent of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system . &quot;
&quot; as tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft have already been used in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data published in the published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the use of Ad@@ vag@@ raf with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients where the transplan@@ tation was rep@@ elled after a treatment duration of one year ( by example examining how often a renewed organ transp@@ l@@ ant or a resum@@ ption of the di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) .
&quot; in addition , shorter studies have been carried out on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and analysed how Ad@@ vag@@ raf in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body . &quot;

&quot; in patients with et@@ less hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) , or one of the other components , additives may not be applied . &quot;
patients and doctors have to be cautious when others ( especially some herbal ) drugs may be taken at the same time with Ad@@ vag@@ raf as the Ad@@ vaginal dosage or the dose of the drug at the same time has to be adjusted accordingly .

&quot; only doctors , who are familiar with the immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy and the treatment of transp@@ l@@ ant patients , this drug should re@@ arrange or make changes in immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant @-@ relevant differences of the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to transp@@ l@@ eness , or to an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ oh@@ s . &quot;
patients should always retain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; con@@ versions of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the narro@@ wer control of one in the transp@@ l@@ ant physician ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; in a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug surveillance and appropriate dosage adjustment must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us will remain . &quot;
&quot; the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ raf should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in the individual case and on blood @-@ level regulations ( see below &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ raf , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mirror should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; day 4 was the systemic exposure , measured as a talent mirror , comparable to both formulations both at Ni@@ er@@ - and le@@ ber@@ ated patients . &quot;
me@@ tic@@ ulous and repeti@@ tive controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transp@@ l@@ ant under Ad@@ vag@@ ant to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate after@@ math phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with lower Clear@@ ance , an adjustment of the Ad@@ vaginal Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can take several days until the ste@@ ady state is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient is allowed in the first post@@ operative phase no or@@ ale intake of drugs , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrations ) are initiated using a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the application of the transp@@ l@@ eness of the transplan@@ tion needs to be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of the oral therapy can not be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the transp@@ l@@ eness of the transp@@ l@@ ite therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning . &quot;
further dos@@ is@@ lets may be required later as the phar@@ yn@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics can change from tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after the transp@@ l@@ ant .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the transp@@ l@@ eness of the transp@@ l@@ ite therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning . &quot;
&quot; dose @-@ recommendations - conversion of Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ raf is must be made of a transp@@ iring dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules upon a once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ raf , so this switch has in proportion 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a switch from other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants on Ad@@ vag@@ raf once daily the treatment with each in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation recommended oral initiation for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ ting rep@@ airing .
&quot; heart transplan@@ tation For adult patients , which are placed on Ad@@ vag@@ raf , is an oral initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day daily take place once in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other transplan@@ tation recept@@ ors though there are no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ raf in pulmon@@ ary , pan@@ eling and col@@ lar patients , came in action plans patients in an oral initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 10 mg / kg / day and with intestinal transplan@@ ts in an oral initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dosage adjustment in special patient @-@ groups patients with reduced liver function z@@ ur maintenance of blood cells in the appropriate field can be required in patients with severe liver functions a reduction of dose is required .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Da kidney function can no influence on the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential as by Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um per@@ at@@ in@@ ants , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ duction of Cre@@ ole ) , and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume . &quot;
conversion of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Ad@@ vag@@ raf In the conversion of an Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in- on a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable to be advised ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the talent mirror in the whole blu@@ t The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in the individual case under the aid of full @-@ blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ it@@ lim@@ it@@ lim@@ us control controls .
&quot; it is recommended that frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us talents during the first two weeks after transp@@ l@@ ant , followed by periodic@@ ally controls during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled by changing pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ raf , dosage adjustment , changes of immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or with the current use of substances which could be controlled by the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us thorough@@ bred ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; because Ad@@ vag@@ raf is a medicine with a low clearing ance , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the ste@@ ady state has entered . &quot;
the data in clinical studies make it possible that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in the blood 20 n@@ g / ml is not exceed .
in clinical practice the talent mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are usually lying in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and n@@ ated patients with 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent testing treatment of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts were usually used blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has resulted in severe undes@@ irable events , including transp@@ l@@ apping or other side effects which can occur in a sequence of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always retain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; con@@ versions of the formulation or the ré@@ g@@ ime should only be carried out under the narro@@ wer control of one in the transp@@ l@@ ant physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 Z@@ ur treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ tation rep@@ ul@@ sion , proved to be proven compared to other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants as therapy @-@ resistant , are still no clinical data for the retar@@ ded formulation Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the transp@@ l@@ ant release in adult heart transplan@@ tation and transp@@ l@@ essor during childhood there are still no clinical data for the retar@@ ded formulation Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
&quot; due to possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ p levels in the blood and a de@@ preci@@ ation of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) contain , or other plant healing during a treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ raf ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood , as the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to significant fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f was a cardi@@ om@@ yo@@ path@@ ia referred to chamber or sep@@ ium hyper@@ trop@@ hia which therefore can also occur at Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart suffering , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hypertension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , liquid over@@ load and oil . &quot;
&quot; like other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of risk or using a solar protection by using a high protective factor . &quot;
&quot; when patients take up the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us symptoms , symptoms for pre@@ es such as head@@ ache , changed state of consciousness , cro@@ ws and visual dys@@ functions should be a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.@@ g . &quot;
&quot; because Ad@@ vag@@ raf carbide , retar@@ ded , l@@ act@@ ose is included , is offered in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary g@@ act@@ ose in@@ tolerant , l@@ act@@ ase lack or glucose @-@ painting absorption . &quot;
the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal medicines known as inhibit@@ ors or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and consequently increase the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; therefore , it recommends that the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels at the simultaneous gift of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism , monitor and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain equal concentrations accordingly ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was made with An@@ tim@@ y@@ k@@ oti@@ ka such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ol , as well as the Macro@@ lid antibiotic Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV protagonist . &quot;
&quot; pharmaceutical studies studies , that the increase in the blood levels mainly derived from the increased bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the in@@ hibition of the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal metabolism . &quot;
&quot; high do@@ si@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute abnorm@@ alities , can increase or reduce the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with pharmaceuticals can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 metabolic metabolic rate .
&quot; because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us desc@@ ends the clearing of ster@@ oid @-@ contra@@ tiv@@ a and thus increase the hormone level , in decisions about recep@@ tive measures should be particularly cautious . &quot;
the results of veterin@@ arians have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and can extend their half times .
the results of a small number of investigations on transp@@ l@@ ant patients provide no indication that under tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants an increased risk of unwanted events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the newborn is based on possible damaging effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ op@@ a@@ emia of the newborn ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the side @-@ effective profile of immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants can often be found precisely because of the patient &apos;s disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other drugs .

&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water @-@ soluble and the high degree of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ zed . &quot;
activity mechanism and pharmac@@ ological effects At molecular level should be conve@@ yed the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us through its bond to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ous protein ( F@@ K@@ B@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for the en@@ rich@@ ment of the connection in the cellular memory .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ eration inhibit@@ or of signal trans@@ duc@@ ts because of the T @-@ cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain series of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .

&quot; L@@ ung@@ entran@@ tation In an interim report about a recent , multi @-@ centric study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was reported on 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; chronic transplan@@ tion , the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ate syndrome , was less frequently observed in the first year after the transp@@ l@@ ant ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8,@@ 57 % ) . &quot;

&quot; factors such as a low ha@@ em@@ o@@ rite level and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ restricted faction of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or one through treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , should be responsible for the higher Clear@@ ance rates after the transp@@ l@@ ant . &quot;

&quot; Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a lack of factor VIII , con@@ genital blood circulation disorder ) . &quot;
&quot; the dosage and frequency of the application shall be applied to whether it is applied to the treatment of bleeding , or to the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII lack , causing blood flow problems like bleeding in the joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa not extracted from human plasma but according to a method used as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
&quot; it is produced from a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of the human scent factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Re@@ ch@@ ate , but is similar in any other way , so that drug does not contain proteins or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate housing , including a study of 53 children under six years , the application of the drug is investigated with the prevention of bleeding as well as surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate was awarded in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ tum with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; well . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , Py@@ re@@ xie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human scent factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or one of the other components . &quot;
March 2004 shared the European Commission of Ba@@ x@@ ter AG received approval for the accounting of Adv@@ entures in the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of substitution treatment are based on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency , after the place and the extent of the blood and the patient &apos;s clinical state . &quot;
&quot; in the following ha@@ mor@@ ant events , the factor of VIII activity is expected to sink among the specified plastic bars ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / d@@ l ) . &quot;
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute distur@@ ban@@ ces are eliminated .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger for the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment of treatment , it is used to control the required dosage and the incidence of injections , and the incidence of the C @-@ plasma system . &quot;
individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII to reach various in vi@@ vo recovery and have different intermediate times .
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis Z@@ ur long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be doses between 20 and 40 % of factor VIII per kg of body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor of VIII @-@ plasma activities cannot be reached or if the bleeding with a reasonable dose is not controlled , a test must be performed in order to correct an in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic interventions must be wei@@ ghed . &quot;
&quot; the administration speed should be directed after the patient &apos;s consent , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co @-@ respiratory activity of a factor VIII @-@ oriented Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ine which can be quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; to develop inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ relate with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the largest and dependent on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; the patients ( PT@@ Ps ) has been observed with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ n@@ ac @-@ known inhibit@@ ors , according to conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product to another , the re@@ occur of ( lower ) inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of the ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women lie on the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation , no experience . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DRC &apos;s largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who all have previously untreated patients who have a higher risk for the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ ache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( respectively 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not invaluable ) . &quot;

blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in the plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th of the day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE on 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostic he@@ avier to moderate he@@ y@@ hi@@ lie A ( F@@ VIII &lt; 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentrations ( ≥ 150 days ) just a patient showed a low in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2.@@ 4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
&quot; in addition , there was none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hoo@@ ves A ( F@@ VIII &lt; 2 % ) after prior exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentrations ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or . &quot;
in the case not treated patients of a current clinical study formed 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
&quot; the immune response of patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by the study of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters , and painted side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of the anti@@ body mirror against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , otherwise , however , did not appear any signs or symptoms related to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients have been isolated about the occurrence of pri@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of os@@ inate fighters in several repeated product positions within the study . &quot;

&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP is based on the safety sampling of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the regulatory filing for 5 years should apply a further extension procedure . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited announced the Committee for Human@@ itarian Research ( CH@@ MP ) with the fact that the company withdraw its application for approval for the transport of Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; however , however , the breast , the brain , the bones , or the wheat parts ( tissues that connect to other structures in the body , surrounds and supports ) . &quot;
&quot; this is a sort of virus that is genetically modified , that it can be a gene into the cells of the body . &quot;
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; , &quot; which has been changed so that there is no copies of itself and thus do not trigger infections in human beings . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been pro@@ cured directly into the tum@@ ors , and thus allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is made from the not broken in the human body , is usually formed to restore DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , where the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company placed data from a study with a patient , at the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer in the field of construction , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP has checked the answers of the company on the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ solved . &quot;
&quot; based on the examination of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP does not create a list of questions submitted to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it has not been proven that the inj@@ ecting of Adv@@ ex@@ in at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ours will bring benefits to patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the way of administration , and the security of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not proven enough that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company did not know the CH@@ MP whether the reimbur@@ sement of consequences for patients , who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; com@@ ic Use &quot; programmes with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot;
&quot; altered reality fre@@ ading &quot; means that the tablets are so composite , that one of the effective components immediately and the other slowly spread over a few hours . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever , caused by an allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nose @-@ sli@@ skin swelling ( pet@@ al nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and adolescents 12 years old , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that is to be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al endom@@ etri@@ um ( hidden nose ) , are sealed . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can neg@@ ate on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
&quot; the main components were the changes in the severity of the ha@@ y fever , which were reported by patients prior to treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the trial , patients bore their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale , as difficult the symptoms in the last 12 hours were . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of all ha@@ y symptom symptoms besides the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % compared to patients , the pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al endom@@ etri@@ um was considered , patients under the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a allevi@@ ation of symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26,@@ 7 % in patients who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are T@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate ( coron@@ ary ) , harmon@@ isation , psych@@ omot@@ or , fatigue , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ ni@@ ol@@ ence , in@@ som@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is allowed to be applied in patients , who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in or one of the other components , against in@@ ep@@ in@@ ep@@ in@@ ine agents or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another drug for treating allergies ) are not applied . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a bot@@ t@@ angle glau@@ coma ( increased eye pressure ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular diseases including hypertension ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( over@@ functioning of the thy@@ roid gland ) , or have a risk of cerebral diar@@ rhe@@ a stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission gave the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is in the whole to swal@@ low ( i.e. without being cr@@ ush , to break or che@@ wing ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in children under 12 years due to the failure of data on in@@ consistency and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the use of time to 10 days , since long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can decrease in time . &quot;
&quot; after decrease in the swelling of the mu@@ cos@@ mon@@ y in the upper breath , the treatment can be continued when needed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; since aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze pseudo @-@ in , the drug is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mon@@ o@@ am@@ in@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tic activity in combination of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ cken such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , wat@@ erg@@ y@@ dro@@ ot@@ tom@@ amine , or other Dek@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , the per@@ oral or nas@@ al as an un@@ sul@@ try rhin@@ ologi@@ an , eph@@ edr@@ in , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient collective , and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate recommendations for the dosage . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction , and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate recommendations for dosage . &quot;
&quot; patients need to be informed about the treatment in the appearance of a hyper@@ ton@@ y or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate or of palm , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or strengthening the head@@ ache ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of following patients groups , caution is advised : • patients under D@@ IG@@ ITA@@ L@@ IS • patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ous in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ kel@@ m in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before carrying der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka will otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions and reduce costs . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol additionally administered , however , were not clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
&quot; with the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or testing results , no significant differences between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and the patients treated with placebo regardless of whether this lor@@ ries was taken up alone or with alcohol . &quot;
the enzymes for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible en@@ ame has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines could not be completely ruled out .
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of P @-@ Gly@@ kop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ thin@@ kable use of the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , does not increase the frequency of abnorm@@ alities compared to the incidence of normal population . &quot;
since reproductive studies on animals do not always be transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ k@@ tor@@ ic properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in should not be used Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in pregnancy .
&quot; however , patients should be noted , however , that in very rare cases it may come to a stup@@ er that can lead to impairment of transport or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms can vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( se@@ dation , Ap@@ no@@ e , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , cardiovascular ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tu@@ als . &quot;
&quot; head@@ ache , anxiety , ag@@ grav@@ itation , muscle weakness , and increased muscle tension , euph@@ oria , excitement , drink , vom@@ iting , sickness , vom@@ iting , Tinnitus , A@@ tax@@ ie , visual dys@@ functions and hyp@@ ot@@ ony or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; a Z@@ NS stimulation is especially likely in children as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , p@@ up@@ ill@@ age and di@@ lat@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the im@@ itation of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es , as well as the im@@ itation of the expression of the pl@@ ain@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ lip@@ se P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ m cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg has no influence on standard measurement sizes including the strengthening of subjective blows or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , there was no increased frequency of bat compared to placebo in the recommended dosage of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; the or@@ ale application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in in the recommended dosage can give further sympathetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , an ach@@ y@@ kar@@ mic or manifestations of a Z@@ NS arousal . &quot;
&quot; it took 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets received . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ am@@ in@@ antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the total scores for the symptom ( except nose @-@ sli@@ b@@ skin ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the abnormal effect , determined by the nose @-@ grin@@ der skin , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in is proven within 30 minutes after the administration in the plasma . &quot;
&quot; according to the per@@ tin@@ al application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with healthy Pro@@ ban@@ den over 14 days , the flow weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in day 10 has been reached . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ disciplinary study study , which has been performed with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult commis@@ sions , has been noted that four Pro@@ ban@@ den des@@ lor@@ ries was poorly made . &quot;
a component inter@@ mission study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and Au@@ c ) of pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the all@@ ot@@ ation of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in bio@@ equivalent was for exposure to the gift of a Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ ology , toxicity in repeti@@ tive gift , to Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and for re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ism , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in are not able to recognize any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxicity than its single components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day not ter@@ ato@@ gen . &quot;

&quot; it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - L@@ yo@@ phil@@ is@@ at for inser@@ ting ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg melting ( tablets that can dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ up and as 0,5 mg / ml solution for inclusion . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup b@@ z@@ w . &quot;
&quot; for children ages six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup b@@ z@@ w . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies of about 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( among them four studies at seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies on patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness has been measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of p@@ add@@ les , impairment of sleep and performance in day ) before and after six weeks treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to the installation and the melt @-@ coated tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us at an average decrease of the symptom ( symptom score ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies in Ur@@ tik@@ aria was the decrease of the symptom to six weeks treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % compared with placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in or one of the other components . &quot;
January 2001 shared the European Commission of the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical trials to the effectiveness in the use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in for young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
&quot; the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be termin@@ ated according to the previous disease , and after the end of the symptoms , the symptoms can be termin@@ ated and with their re @-@ occur . &quot;
&quot; in the pers@@ isting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients may be recommended during the allergy time a continuous treatment . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not established in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in addition administered ( see below section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study has been enhanced with the current intake of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the most efficient effect of alcohol ( see below section 5.1 ) .
&quot; however , patients should be noted , however , that in very rare cases it may come to ben@@ id@@ ation that can lead to impairment of transport or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than with patients treated with placebo . &quot;
the most frequently asked side effects which were reported more frequently than with placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) and headaches ( 0.@@ 8 % ) and headaches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients aged 12 to 17 was the most common side effects which occurred at 5.2 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; in a multi@@ disciplinary dose , administered by up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the im@@ itation of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es , as well as the im@@ itation of the expression of the pl@@ ain@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ lip@@ se P @-@ sel@@ ek@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multi @-@ professional , in which the lor@@ lor@@ ries was administered in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect has been described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in a dosage administered of 45 mg daily ( the ninth of the clinical dose ) over ten days was administered , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls showed itself . &quot;
&quot; at a single dos@@ is@@ - study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes including the strengthening of subjective blows or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching flow , redness and redness of the eyes as well as itch on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classi@@ fying in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be classified according to the duration of symptoms , alternatively in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week , or less than 4 weeks . &quot;
pers@@ isting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the appearance of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall performance of the freight and quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ sub@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ished the due to seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria was re@@ acting for further forms of pri@@ tik@@ aria since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology in spite of the branches in different forms is similar and chronic patients can be more straightforward rec@@ tive .
&quot; since the hist@@ am@@ in@@ se@@ is@@ tion is a primary factor in all ur@@ tik@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in except for the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria also results in other forms of pri@@ tik@@ aria to improve the symptoms . this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first tin @-@ inter@@ v@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti @-@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria was the minority of patients who were not responded to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , out of the study . &quot;
an improvement of the itch by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the dis@@ ruption of sleep and wax , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmaceutical diagnostic study , in which patients &quot; Dem@@ ographies were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , has been achieved by 4 % of the patients a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
there are no clue to a clin@@ ically relevant Kum@@ ulation after a daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
&quot; however , for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible en@@ ame , it has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines will not be completely excluded . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of P @-@ Gly@@ kop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , low @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) is not on the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
the trials conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in carried out pre@@ clinical trials at a comparable level of exposure from Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in to no qualitative or quanti@@ t@@ ative differences in terms of tox@@ ins of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ ology , toxicity in repeti@@ tive gift , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and for re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ism , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ ry can be recognized in no particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; color@@ less film ( contains li@@ act@@ ose mon@@ oh@@ er@@ ate , hy@@ drop@@ sy , titanium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go@@ car@@ min ( E 132 ) , coloured film ( contains hy@@ prom@@ o , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , Car@@ nau@@ ba@@ wax , born wax . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to allevi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) .
the ti@@ ghtened doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years can be caused by an infection ( see below section 4.@@ 4 ) and that no data is available that support a treatment of inf@@ ect@@ ous rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , in diagnos@@ ing the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical investigations and related laboratory and skin examinations should play a role . &quot;
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of metabolic des@@ lor@@ ries are limited and experienced a higher sub@@ stan@@ z@@ ure effect ( see below section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years , which are not restricted , is identical to those with children , which are normal . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains Sac@@ char@@ ose and Sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with inherited problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose in@@ tolerant , glucose absorption or an Sac@@ char@@ ase Is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine is not taking . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have been administered as part of clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in addition to which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in addition administered ( see below section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study has been enhanced with the current intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the most efficient effect of alcohol ( see below section 5.1 ) .
the overall prevalence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as much as the placebo group .
&quot; in clinical studies with adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than with patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi@@ disciplinary dose of adults and juven@@ iles , with up to 45 mg of lor@@ lor@@ ries ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) have been administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children between the ages of 1 and 11 years old who came from an anti@@ hist@@ am@@ in@@ therapy have received a daily Des@@ tru@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults can be extr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ated in adults to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study involving multiple adults and juven@@ iles , in which the lor@@ lor@@ ries was applied in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects have been described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and teenagers , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ninth of the clinical dose ) has been applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls showed itself . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and young people in clinical studies led to no impairment of psych@@ omot@@ or . &quot;
in clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults it was neither an increase of alcohol either to a strengthening of alcohol induc@@ ed performance imp@@ aired to an increase in the sle@@ ep@@ iness .
&quot; adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s were A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively in reli@@ eving the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching flow and redness of the eyes as well as ju@@ ck@@ ery on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall performance of the freight and quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ sub@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , decrease A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively the due to seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first tin @-@ inter@@ v@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ sians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; similar pharmac@@ o@@ cr@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ disciplinary study study with the sy@@ ru@@ denti@@ fication of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are restricted . &quot;
the load ( Au@@ c ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was about 3 to 6 hours higher and the C@@ max about 3 to 4@@ times higher with a tempor@@ al half distance of about 120 hours .
there are no clue to a clin@@ ically relevant ingredient cum@@ ulation after a daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days with adults and juven@@ iles .
12 In various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable with those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .

&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect flu , which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus . &quot;
&quot; this is a special type of vaccine that could cause a future pan@@ demic , which could cause a future pan@@ demic . &quot;
a flu pan@@ demic breaks out when a new tribe of influenza virus is emerging , which can be easily spread from man to man because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; according to the administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognises the vaccine contained in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; physical alien &quot; &quot; and is antibodies against it . &quot;
this makes the immune system later able to form in contact with a flu virus of this ordinary human antibodies .
&quot; subsequently , the or@@ atories of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recognizes the human body as body @-@ foreign ) and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; a survey of some of the study centers showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for the evaluation of the safety of the vaccine would not be able to fulfill the requirements of the guidelines of E@@ MEA for pre@@ pan@@ demic vaccines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical examination and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like further information about the CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are caused by human immune weaker virus from type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which is infected with acquired immun@@ ode@@ ficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who can not swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ generic is available as a solution to one , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the security of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked , which has taken the anti@@ viral medicines of the patient previously , and the likelihood has judged that the virus is to address the drug . &quot;
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily along with twice daily 100 mg k@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is based on the body weight . &quot;
am@@ ase is reduced by taking in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
&quot; AIDS does not cure , however , may delay the immune system of the immune system and therefore also delay the development of associated infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; ast@@ ase has been examined in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , examined in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults , who had previously been treated not with Prot@@ eas@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; this enhanced with low do@@ si@@ pped Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicine A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 20@@ 6 adults , which had previously been previously prot@@ ection@@ able , with other prot@@ eas@@ ants . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( virus last ) or the change of virus last after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ rac@@ ers , after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase more patients had a virus last below 400 copies / ml than under placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; with children decreased v@@ at@@ ase also had the viral burden , however , with the children , who were treated earlier with Prot@@ eas@@ ants , were only very few of the treatment languages . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults , who had been treated earlier with Prot@@ eas@@ ants , the viral medicines created with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicines am@@ us@@ last after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ rac@@ ers : &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ rac@@ ers , it came together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the virus last after four weeks as with the patients who received their previous protests : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of ast@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , rash and FA@@ TI@@ gue ( ti@@ redness ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is also not allowed to be used in patients , the cur@@ ran@@ ts ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines which are exactly as ast@@ ase and are harmful in high concentrations in blood health . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , there is patients who occupy as@@ gener@@ ase ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( die of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection caused by the reco@@ vering immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Pharmac@@ euticals ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat with prot@@ ection@@ able HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic amplifier , but the committee noted that the benefits of ast@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients , who previously did not have any prot@@ ection@@ ers , is not proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally registered under &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; , &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot;
October 2000 the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group limited a permit for the transport of as@@ gener@@ ase throughout the European Union .
&quot; am@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prot@@ ection@@ able adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
for usually A@@ generic capsules are to be administered for pharmac@@ o@@ cr@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sts of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resource and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r as a solution to inhal@@ ing is 14 % less than the Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; hence , am@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ generic capsules are used without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sts ) , higher doses need to be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the pharmac@@ o@@ cr@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of am@@ ase in combination with low doses of chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ections , have not been studied in children . &quot;
&quot; ast@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the mis@@ understanding of data to un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose should be reduced to A@@ generic capsules with adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction at 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver functions on 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application is intended for patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction with caution , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
am@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations contained in St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma @-@ concentration and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ kled avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with am@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usually A@@ generic capsules are to be used together with low doses of chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral hepatitis treatment have an increased risk of severe liver symptoms with potentially fatal course .
&quot; for the event of simultaneous anti @-@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the technical information of these medicines . &quot;
patients with existing limited liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis are an increased frequency of liver functions under anti@@ retro@@ viral hepatitis therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous application of A@@ generic and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other glucose levels , which will be copied via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended , unless the possible benefits of treatment the risk of systemic Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid of effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Sup@@ compression of the adren@@ al function . ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
as the inter@@ changeable of the H@@ M@@ G Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ ine and Sim@@ vast@@ atin strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended as a simultaneous administration of m@@ yo@@ path@@ ia and Sim@@ vast@@ atin because of the increased risk of m@@ yo@@ path@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen .
&quot; 4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of International norm@@ ality Rati@@ o ) , are available methods of determining the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of decreased plastic bars of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills can be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to appreciate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ holes , particularly if it is still administered low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
due to the possible risk of toxicity of toxicity due to the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col@@ dness of the axi@@ al solution to take up this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under a age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patients .
am@@ ase should be set in duration 5 if a rash may be accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including Prot@@ eas@@ ants , was reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an ex@@ ac@@ uation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other disorders related to their therapy drugs which are associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in case of h@@ ophi@@ le patients ( Type A and B ) , the reports have been treated with prot@@ ections , are reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous explo@@ iter and hem@@ o@@ arthritis . &quot;
HIV @-@ infected patients with serious immune def@@ ective can develop an inflammatory or resi@@ dual reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections that leads to severe clinical states or deterioration of symptoms .
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial ti@@ ti@@ ology is assumed ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ oh@@ s , higher body @-@ measure index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral hepatitis therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width as@@ gener@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
&quot; C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeu@@ tical width at@@ ase with chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be used together with medicines , whose active ingredients are predominantly distributed over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to the increased plastic bars with serious and / or life @-@ threatening unwanted effects . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is caused by a 82 % reduction in the Au@@ c of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a pesti@@ cides . &quot;
&quot; when trying to compens@@ ate the lower plastic bars by a dosage increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often unwanted effects on the liver were observed . &quot;
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um@@ mirror of Am@@ kled avi@@ r can be humili@@ ated by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already takes the cur@@ few species , the am@@ spec@@ tro@@ om levels and , if possible , check the virus last and put the cur@@ rant . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ kled avi@@ r ( see also em@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
50@@ 8 % increased for C@@ max to 30 % per day when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
in clinical trials dos@@ ages of 600 mg am@@ kled twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is applied twice a day that occupy the effectiveness and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % humili@@ ating when Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in plasma which have been reached with calcium ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ lift twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) are administered in combination with 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
&quot; a me@@ tering intake for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra cannot be given , but there is a ti@@ ghter control , since the effectiveness and un@@ thin@@ kable this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , however , is advised due to the fantasy component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , however , that the revenue of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and A@@ gener@@ ase is at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore at the gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ence in combination with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment required .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ence in combination with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ection@@ ers would be low .
the effect of ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other prot@@ ection@@ able and existing limited data may suggest that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in the ser@@ um@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r may lo@@ wers .
&quot; if these medicines should be used simultaneously , caution is advisable because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din may be less effective because of the decreased or possibly sub@@ therapeu@@ tical plastic bars . &quot;
&quot; when these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous gift of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( Au@@ c ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at 19@@ 3 % and thus a rise in the side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is required for clinical reasons to ad@@ minister Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with am@@ ase , becomes a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data available for this . &quot;
&quot; pharmaceutical studies have not been carried out in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin , but could be increased the plastic bars of both drugs in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ kled with 200 mg k@@ az@@ ol once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max from K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol to the 2.@@ 6@@ 9@@ m compared to the value that has been observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily without the simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines which are listed below are also sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are used together with ast@@ ase , potentially cause interactions . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be advised on toxic reactions , associated with these medicines , if they are used in combination with am@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ection@@ ers , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da may not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , since it can come to reset disrup@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti @-@ con@@ vul@@ ants , known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r can lead to a humili@@ ation of the plasma bars of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channels like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ pp@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ pp@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ pp@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ pp@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ pp@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ pp@@ di@@ pin , N@@ agu@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxicity of these medicines . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous intake with am@@ ase can increase considerably and reinforce with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual impair@@ ments and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days at Pro@@ ban@@ den , climbed the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plastic bars ( 4 times daily ) , while the endo@@ genic cor@@ ti@@ sol grew by about 86 % cervi@@ x 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ ti@@ ko@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of treatment is the risk of systemic Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ M@@ G Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , such as Lov@@ ast@@ ine and Sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , the under@@ mining of the plastic bars are expected at the same administration of as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
since Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ pelines increase in these H@@ M@@ G Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to m@@ yo@@ path@@ ia including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sis , the combined application of these medicines is not recommended using am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to be more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations up to stabili@@ ze the mirror , since the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased from the current gift of Am@@ kled avi@@ r ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase is not to be applied together with oral mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while at the same application of ast@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is advisable . &quot;
data for simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ection@@ er inhibit@@ ors to a possible increase in the plastic bars in Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3@@ - to 4 @-@ times .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ holes , particularly if there are also low doses from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the low reliability of historical comparisons , no recommendation can be given , as the am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose is to be adapted simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one at the same time . &quot;
&quot; at the simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ ase , greater control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ality Rati@@ o ) is recommended because of the possibility of a de@@ preci@@ ation or strengthening of the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ anic effect ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
the effect of an additional administration of chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills can not be predicted as well as alternative methods to contrac@@ eption .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may be applied only after careful ref@@ usal of possible usage for the mother compared with the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk , amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , however , it is not known whether am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r enters into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of toler@@ able rats , which was administered by the uter@@ us in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation sy@@ ring@@ avi@@ r , showed during the lac@@ tation period a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight in the after@@ math . &quot;
the further development of descendants including fer@@ til@@ isation and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r to the parent .
the in@@ adequ@@ acy of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most associated with the ax@@ ase treatment associated side effects were slightly to moder@@ ately developed , occurred early and led to the treatment of treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are used in connection with the intake of aging or another simultaneously to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the cru@@ ising disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the listed side effects are from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with Prot@@ eas@@ ants not pre@@ treated patients 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were tested by the investig@@ ators than in connection with the study medication , and in more than 1 % of patients were performed , as well as under the treatment of initial laboratory changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral hepatitis therapy has been associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ stream@@ ph@@ ie ) with HIV patients , including a loss of peripher@@ al and lower under@@ @-@ fat tissue , multip@@ ly in@@ dom@@ inal and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ vi@@ k@@ al fat collection ( Sti@@ ern@@ els ) . &quot;
&quot; among 113 anti@@ retro@@ aci@@ ally not intended persons , which were treated with am@@ spec@@ tro@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ dov@@ u@@ dine over a medium term of 36 weeks , was only one case ( Sti@@ ern@@ els ) ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , with 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - treated patients under am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a medium term of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin attacks were usually mild to moder@@ ately developed , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ al nature , with or without itch , and appeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ spec@@ tro@@ r . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose cases were reported in particular in patients with generally well known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral hepatitis therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with heavy immune def@@ ective , it can develop an inflammatory or resi@@ dual reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI @-@ treated patients , the 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily along with low do@@ si@@ ated Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of side effects ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( level 3 and 4 ) which were treated with some cases of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d@@ - and CP@@ K values , which were among patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low do@@ si@@ pped Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were very frequently appeared . &quot;
&quot; in case of exagger@@ ation , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , are necessary support measures . &quot;
Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds the active center of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ector and thereby prevents the process of viral viral and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - Poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ gs with the result of a formation of non @-@ irrit@@ ating virus particles .
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) , as well as at peri@@ ph@@ ate blood@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ con@@ centric ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm with acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm for chronic cells .
the connection between the activity of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the im@@ itation of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .

&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended to always use the current interpre@@ tations systems to analyse the results of pesti@@ cides . &quot;
on Phen@@ otyp@@ ic remains @-@ based analyses Klin@@ gen@@ ized phen@@ otype @-@ interpre@@ tations systems can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otype data regarding the estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ection@@ able resistant insulation .
companies that distribute diagnostic tests tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otype Cut @-@ offs ( divi@@ ders ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a pesti@@ cides .
&quot; each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to Am@@ kled genetic pattern creates a certain cross resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains in general . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on the cross resistance service between Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ eas@@ ants for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r reset , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ ulated patients , with whom a Fos@@ am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ avi@@ r@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ avi@@ r@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 insul@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ rac@@ ers @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of these activity seems to be dependent upon the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the insul@@ ates . &quot;
the early breakdown of a contaminated therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits that may affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; evidence of the effectiveness of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , so@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly treated with lower Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; oo@@ st@@ avi@@ r &quot; , &quot; received . &quot;
&quot; one hundred thre@@ es@@ een ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with subsequent virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the sub @-@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ sub @-@ embarrass@@ ment from AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the So@@ C @-@ PI group in regard to the time limit ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma after 16 weeks at a non @-@ sub @-@ shaft of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; the evidence of the effectiveness of un@@ bund@@ oo@@ ed a@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 2@@ 88 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 had been treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ generic solution to take up and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
it was not given a low do@@ si@@ ated Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the group associated with ax@@ ase N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
&quot; after 48 weeks , about 25 % of the patients included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ al increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
19 Basi@@ cs on this data should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ bund@@ oo@@ ed &quot; axi@@ ally .
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) up to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0,5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
50@@ 8 % increased for C@@ max increased by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
&quot; the administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % discount of the Au@@ c , but has no effect on concentration of Am@@ spec@@ tr@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of the Res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent volume of distribution amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg in a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be enclosed in a large branch of distribution as well as an enormous penetration of the blood circulation into the tissues .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the drug in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bund@@ ling am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r which represents the active share , probably unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bund@@ ling am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r remains unchanged , the percentage of free active components during the Do@@ wage @-@ State in the ste@@ ady state on the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is induc@@ ing or inhibit@@ or or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution will be given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of am@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is out of the solution 14 % less bi@@ over@@ si@@ bar than from the capsules , therefore , axi@@ ase solution and ax@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of kidney disease can be minor to the Eli@@ min@@ ation of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
this treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r plasma is comparable to those that can be obtained at healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ kled avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for can@@ o@@ sten@@ si@@ vity on mice and rats stood in doses of male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular Aden@@ ome at doses of the 2,@@ 0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( r@@ atte ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ kled avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism of the emergence of the hep@@ at@@ ular atoms and car@@ cin@@ oma was not yet elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , from the present ex@@ posi@@ tional data on humans , both from clinical studies and therapeutic application , however , there are little evidence of the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ genom@@ ic tests , the bacterial re@@ vert mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , micro@@ k@@ ern@@ test on rats and chromos@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ation at human peri@@ ph@@ ate lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ an@@ ed nor con@@ genital di@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
this liver toxicity can be monitored and detected in clinical everyday life through measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; until now , in clinical studies have not been observed any significant liver toxicity in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase still after the end of the treatment . &quot;
studies for juven@@ iles were treated with juven@@ iles as well as at the age of 4 were treated as high mortality rate at the age of 4 days .
&quot; in a systemic plasma system , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage , however , were observed a number of minor changes including Th@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes that refer to a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ generic capsules are used without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sts ) , higher doses need to be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application is intended for patients with watch@@ ful or mild liver dysfunction with caution , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of International norm@@ ality Rati@@ o ) , are available methods of determining the drug concentration . &quot;
am@@ ase should be set in duration 27 if a rash may be accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; an increased risk to a light d@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is caused by a 82 % reduction in the Au@@ c of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a pesti@@ cides . &quot;
50@@ 8 % increased for C@@ max to 30 % per day when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in plasma which have been reached with calcium ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ lift twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) are administered in combination with 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
&quot; a me@@ tering intake for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra cannot be given , but there is a ti@@ ghter control , since the effectiveness and un@@ thin@@ kable this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ence in combination with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ection@@ ers would be low .
&quot; when these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is required for clinical reasons to ad@@ minister Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with am@@ ase , becomes a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there is no clinical data available for this . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channels like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ pp@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ pp@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ pp@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxicity of these medicines . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days at Pro@@ ban@@ den , climbed the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plastic bars ( 4 times daily ) , while the endo@@ genic cor@@ ti@@ sol grew by about 86 % cervi@@ x 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; at the simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ ase , greater control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ality Rati@@ o ) is recommended because of the possibility of a de@@ preci@@ ation or strengthening of the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ anic effect ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl@@ est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.@@ 0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease in the Au@@ c and C@@ min by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r by 22 % b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may be applied only after careful ref@@ usal of possible usage for the mother compared with the possible risks to the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of toler@@ able rats , which was administered by the uter@@ us in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation sy@@ ring@@ avi@@ r , showed during the lac@@ tation period a dimin@@ ished increase of body weight in the after@@ math . &quot;
the in@@ adequ@@ acy of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of exagger@@ ation , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , are necessary support measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al blood cells . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ con@@ centric ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm with acute cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ rac@@ ers @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of these activity seems to be dependent upon the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the insul@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on this data , it should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ bund@@ oo@@ ed &quot; axi@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bund@@ ling am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r remains unchanged , the percentage of free active components during the Do@@ wage @-@ State in the ste@@ ady state on the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is induc@@ ing or inhibit@@ or or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution will be given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the effect of kidney disease can be minor to the Eli@@ min@@ ation of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for can@@ o@@ sten@@ si@@ vity on mice and rats stood in doses of male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular Aden@@ ome in doses , which spoke to the 2.@@ 0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( r@@ atte ) of exposure to people after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ kled avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ative Aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma was not yet elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , from the present ex@@ posi@@ tional data on humans , both from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application however , there were little evidence of the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ genom@@ ic tests , the bacterial re@@ vert mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , micro@@ k@@ ern@@ test on rats and chromos@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ation in human peri@@ ph@@ ate lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ an@@ ed nor con@@ genital ox@@ ic . &quot;
studies for juven@@ iles were treated with juven@@ iles as well as at the age of 4 were treated as high mortality rate at the age of 4 days .
&quot; these results conclude that in Jung@@ le the Met@@ abol@@ isation routes are not fully mature , so Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r or other critical constitu@@ tions of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; axi@@ ase solution for penetration is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ection@@ able adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; the benefit of the benefit of chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; am@@ ase solution &quot; &quot; has not been treated with PI @-@ treated patients with PI @-@ treated patients with PI @-@ treated patients . &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r as a solution to inhal@@ ing is 14 % less than the Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; hence , am@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; patients should , as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with taking the solution to one stop ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic solution is 17 mg ( 1.@@ 1 ml ) Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2@@ 800 mg am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; additionally , since no dose @-@ recommendations could be given for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to one and low do@@ si@@ pped Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination with these patients should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; although a dosage adjustment for am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r is not necessary for necessary , an application of a generic solution for inclusion in patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col@@ der is a generic solution for children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with limited liver function or liver failure , and contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
the simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive im@@ itation of the met@@ alli@@ zation of these medicines and may cause severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythms .
patients should be advised that A@@ generic or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with am@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 in transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination .
&quot; for some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of International norm@@ ality Rati@@ o ) , are available methods of determining the drug concentration . &quot;
am@@ ase should be set to duration if a rash may be accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; an increased risk to a light d@@ ystro@@ phy has been associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with pharmaceutical and 49 dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in case of h@@ ophi@@ le patients ( Type A and B ) , the reports have been treated with prot@@ ections , are reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous explo@@ iter and hem@@ o@@ arthritis . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is caused by a 82 % reduction in the Au@@ c of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a pesti@@ cides . &quot;
50@@ 8 % increased for C@@ max to 30 % per day when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
&quot; the simultaneous intake with am@@ ase can increase considerably and increase with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
on the basis of data to 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors are expected to significantly higher Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations of mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly higher Plas@@ ma@@ z@@ ol@@ am .

&quot; in the milk , amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , however , it is not known whether am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r enters into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of toler@@ able rats , which was administered by the uter@@ us in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation sy@@ ring@@ avi@@ r , showed during the lac@@ tation period a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight in the after@@ math . &quot;

&quot; the application rigi@@ dity and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dara depend on the treating a disease . • In small bas@@ al cell disease the cream is weekly for six weeks a week . • In small bas@@ al cell cycles , the cream is weekly during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks of break between the treatment cycles , three times weekly . &quot;
&quot; the cream is in front of the sleep , thin the affected skin @-@ surfaces , so that they have sufficient for a long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed away . &quot;
&quot; in all studies Al@@ dara was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dara was tested in four major studies to 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete storage of war@@ ms . • Al@@ dara was also examined at 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell intake , in which patients were treated six weeks and Al@@ dara or the placebo either daily or five times weekly . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete waste of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara was also tested in two studies in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ins .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dara was more effective than the placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts treated in the genital area was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with placebo @-@ treated patients , but only 3 % to 18 % treated with the placebo @-@ treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dara ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of the cream ( pain or it@@ chy ) .

the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is so long to continue until all the visible fats in the genital area or peripher@@ als have disappeared or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
any interruption in the treatment described above should be wei@@ ghed when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) or when in the treatment area a infection is observed .
&quot; if at the follow @-@ up investigation 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the lesi@@ ons are just un@@ fully healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose was left , the patient sol@@ dered the cream as soon as he / she noticed this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is in a thin layer and converted into the framed , with flag@@ ging infected skin , until the cream is completely moved . &quot;
it should be associated with these patients between the benefits of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with its autoimmune disease .
it should be associated with these patients a cancellation between the benefits of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ@@ ist or gra@@ ft versus @-@ host@@ al reaction .
&quot; in other studies , no daily pre @-@ auth@@ ored hygiene has been performed , two cases of severe p@@ hi@@ mos@@ is and one case observed with one to the circumc@@ ision of leading rop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in case of an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases also caused heavy local skin irritation , which have a treatment required and / or lead to a temporary physical impairment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the output of the ureth@@ ra , some women had trouble passing urine which required an emergency ca@@ the@@ ter@@ ization and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous applied funds for the treatment of external f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ches in the genital area and the peripher@@ al range , there are not clinical experiences so far . &quot;
limited data suggest an increased rate of thread reduction in HIV @-@ positive patients with HIV @-@ positive patients ; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lesser effectiveness in this patient group .
&quot; the treatment of the cardi@@ ac disease with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm of the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not examined . &quot;
local bar@@ tre@@ ach actions are common but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form after the completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if it is required due to the discomfort of the patient or due to the severity of the local bar@@ gain actions , a treatment break can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical result of therapy can be assessed after the treatment of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; there is currently no data available on long @-@ term healing rates of over 36 months after the treatment , should be considered in super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell compounds and other suitable therapeutic forms . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs do not have clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended for earlier tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical trial suggest that in great turmoil ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of contact on the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of acute cor@@ at@@ ins on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lip . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute cor@@ at@@ osis to anatom@@ ical places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the data available on the ak@@ tin@@ al ker@@ at@@ ose to the under@@ poor and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application &apos;s purpose , hence such an application will not be recommended . &quot;
local bar@@ tre@@ ach actions frequently occur but these reactions normally take in the course of the therapy of intensity or go after lowering the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if the local bar@@ tre@@ ach actions can cause great discomfort or very strong , the treatment can be exposed for a few days . &quot;
the data of an open clinical trial is that patients with more than 8 AK@@ A lesi@@ ons reported on a less complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons .
&quot; due to the immun@@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive treatment ( see 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;

the most frequently shared and considered probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with three times weekly treatment were local reactions to the place of treatment of genital war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od to patients ) .
among the most commonly reported and considered probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the related side effects include complaints at the App@@ lications with an incidence of 28.@@ 1 % .
the e@@ 185 @-@ controlled clinical study of phase III reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of the Phase III are shown below .
the most common , as probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the context of the side effect were a reaction in the application location ( 22 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . ) . &quot;
&quot; the side @-@ effects which were specified by 25@@ 2 in plac@@ ebo@@ arding clinical trials of Phase III with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; according to the investig@@ ational assessment provided by the clinical signs , the clinical signs demonstrated in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , extru@@ sion ( 23 % ) and Ö@@ VP ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the investig@@ ational assessment provided by the clinical signs , the clinical signs indicated that it came in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sion ( 13 % ) , and to severe sk@@ or@@ ation and bon@@ ding ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies for the examination of the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ ose , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was observed with an incidence of 0.@@ 4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment site or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the vast@@ ly unique absorption of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags , might lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically he@@ avi@@ est side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous hydr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ o@@ cr@@ ine@@ tic examination , following the top@@ ographic application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , increasing systemic concentrations of the alpha@@ interference and other Zy@@ to@@ k@@ ine have been proven . &quot;
in three adequ@@ acy phase 3 efficacy studies could be demonstrated that the effectiveness in relation to a complete healing of the flags at an in@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is clearly superior to a placebo treatment .
&quot; at 60 % of the total 119 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy , patients healed completely off ; this was at 20 % of the 105 with placebo patients in case ( 95 % ) : &quot;
full abor@@ tion could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients compared with 5 % of 16@@ 1 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
&quot; the effectiveness of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od at five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks has been studied in two double @-@ flas@@ hes , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ opath@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ v@@ entri@@ cle with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years of present data indicate that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this also lasted for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three times weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment free period , has been studied in two double @-@ flas@@ hes , plac@@ ings controlled clinical trials . &quot;

&quot; the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show patients with clinical absorption , after one or two treatment periods , a recur@@ rent rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; the approved indications of external f@@ eig@@ ni@@ tion , Ak@@ tin@@ al ker@@ at@@ osis and Super@@ inten@@ tional Bas@@ que , are not normally found in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dara cream was investigated in four random@@ ized , double @-@ blind studies of children aged 2 to 15 years with m@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um Con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not shown in these studies ( 3@@ x / week for a period of &lt; 16 weeks b@@ z@@ w ) . &quot;
a minimum systemic intake of the 5 % id I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during three weeks weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest pharmaceutical concentrations in the Ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amoun@@ ted to 0,@@ 1 , 0.@@ 2 and 1,6 n@@ g / ml when applied in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 inser@@ tion ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bag ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bag ) . &quot;
&quot; the calculated apparent half @-@ time ran@@ ged approximately 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ hour @-@ hour after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous trial , which indicates a prolonged retreat of the drug in the skin . &quot;
the data for systemic exposure showed that the Res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after topical application of patients aged 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with acoustic ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fici@@ ality Bas@@ que .

a two @-@ year study for car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice with mice administration at three days a week induc@@ ed no tum@@ ors at the application point .
&quot; the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption of the human skin and not mut@@ agen@@ s is a risk for humans due to systemic exposure to be very low . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors appeared in the group of mice , which was treated with the effective cream , formerly and in larger numbers than in the control group with lower U@@ VR . &quot;

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is available for long @-@ term enzymes in patients with secure diagnosis of a mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ y@@ sac@@ chari@@ ots I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be , when the patient carries it , every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h can be increased . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no faculty scheme can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined and for these patients no faculty scheme can be recommended .
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treatment patients may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which are defined as any related side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be ti@@ ghtly controlled , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be made available only in an appropriate clinical environment , in the rehabilitation facilities for medical emergen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients can form Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the treatment of treatment . &quot;
&quot; patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , must be treated with caution when applying Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; given little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , must be cautious due to the theoretical risk of an over@@ sensitive reaction after an interruption of the treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the beginning of in@@ fusion with medicines ( Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or Anti@@ Py@@ re@@ tika ) to be used to minimize the potential appearance of in@@ fusion conditions .
&quot; in case of mild or moderate @-@ severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti @-@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ am@@ ass / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be wei@@ ghed and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate , in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a single , serious in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are decreased , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is considering . &quot;
&quot; In@@ fusion may be resum@@ ed with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
3 are ( Ancient and acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction in in@@ fusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the pre@@ paid reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is .
&quot; experimental studies cannot be attributed to direct or indirect impact on the pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; as no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were expon@@ entially against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which were expon@@ entially over the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended , while treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is not silent . &quot;
the effects in clinical trials were mainly affected as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed at 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) .
&quot; unwanted medication related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase 3 years or older during a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are frequently listed in the following table ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history , in addition , heavy reactions , including bronze pas@@ m , breathing stand and facial oils ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children un@@ wished medication in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , who were reported during a Ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under the age of 5 , with predominantly heavy duty @-@ form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , reports are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 e / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , it came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , whereby it came with the patients aged under the age of 5 ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days at the age of 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature retirement from the study ) were reported at 13 / 45 patients , not by radio@@ immun@@ o@@ bedience ( R@@ IP ) as@@ best@@ informed antibodies before , including 3 patients , where there was never a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version . &quot;
patients with lack of anti@@ body levels had a robust reduction in G@@ AG sp@@ eg@@ els in Har@@ n while in patients with high antibodies a variable reduction of G@@ AG in Har@@ n was as@@ certain@@ ed .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ally up to low neutr@@ alised mental effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ a- activity in vit@@ ro that did not interfere with clinical efficacy and / or reducing G@@ AG in the Har@@ n .
&quot; the presence of antibodies seemed to stand not related to the incidence of unwanted medication , even if the appearance of unwanted drug interactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the ration@@ ale for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ al and the prevention of further accumulation of the enzyme .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ osis @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ates recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were investigated in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ em@@ controlled phase 3 @-@ 3 study on 45 patients aged between 6 and 43 . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the entire disease spectrum was rejected , the majority of patients were of the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient referred to the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
&quot; patients have been recru@@ ited , if they had a for@@ ci@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ ator volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters . &quot;
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change to the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute wal@@ kers .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me from the placebo group an improvement in the lung function and the capacity to be presented in the following table . &quot;
in the open extension study an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as out of the following table .
the acceptance of the expected percentage FE@@ V is not significant over this period of clin@@ ically significantly and the absolute lung volum@@ ina increased proportional to the height of grown @-@ grown children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a hep@@ at@@ eg@@ aly treatment of 22 ( 85 % ) , up to the end of the study , a normal liver size . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks a significant waste of the G@@ AG mirror was established in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) , which remained constant until the degree of study . &quot;
&quot; regarding the hetero@@ genic disease gap between patients , which takes into account by using a combined end point , the clin@@ ically significant changes cross @-@ time series , the clin@@ ically significant changes cross @-@ time test ( an expected percentage of 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
&quot; a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was carried out , primarily the safety and pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined in 20 patients , which were at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with the heavy @-@ drawing form and 4 with the middle of the form ) . &quot;
in four patients the dosage was increased because of increased GA@@ G@@ - mirror in Har@@ n in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
&quot; in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight increase ( n = 3 ) and a weight increase ( n = 3 ) ) and all 4 patients with the middle @-@ time form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) , and all 4 patients with the middle @-@ form process are a normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe form of publishing only limited or no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ Do@@ ors schem@@ ata were carried out at G@@ AG &apos;s level in the Har@@ n , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 e / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the faculty scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent in patients who have difficulties with weekly notification ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two Do@@ ors @-@ schem@@ ata is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate all new information , which will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug is updated . &quot;
pharmac@@ o@@ cr@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under the age of 5 was similar to older and less affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ ology , toxicity in particular gift , toxicity in repeti@@ tive Gift and Re@@ productive Tox@@ ic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data does not recognize any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; because no compatibility studies have been carried out , this medicine may not be mixed with other medicines , except with the listed below 6.@@ 6 . &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is applied together with c@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug for cancer ) who have not been removed any chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) if cancer is not being res@@ trained ( or mal@@ ign@@ ant ) ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer ) has already slightly spread to other parts of the body ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant or metastatic &quot; lung cancer , which does not grasp the plate of epitheli@@ um cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy reg@@ imen , used as sole therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and injections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with Cis@@ pl@@ atin , should be given before or after the gift of Cis@@ pl@@ atin in addition an &quot; anti @-@ drug &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a fluid lack ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood image changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be infl@@ ated , or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ alizes also slo@@ ws down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevent the cells share .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ alises in its active form is easier than in cancer cells than in healthy cells which leads to higher concentrations of active form of drug and a longer functioning of cancer cells .
&quot; for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta has been studied in a main study to 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta has been treated in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , which previously had previously been treated with chemotherapy , with the effect of Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , and both in combination with c@@ ate@@ atin in a study on 1 7@@ 25 patients , who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin , survived on average 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the all@@ al@@ administration of Cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received an chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months at Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; however , in both studies patients , in which cancer is not attacked the plate of epitheli@@ um , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival rates than with the previous medicine . &quot;
September 2004 shared the European Commission El@@ i Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. was granted approval for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta across the European Union .
each switch @-@ bottle has to be imposed with 4.@@ 2 ml of 0.@@ 9 % of sodium hydro@@ chl@@ oride injection resolution ( 9 mg / ml ) - which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - sis is taken from the co@@ sting bottle and with 0.@@ 9 % sodium in@@ chl@@ oride injection resolution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml further dil@@ uted ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is in combination with c@@ ate@@ atin to first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ cl@@ ed bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma apart from exagger@@ ating pl@@ atten@@ tively hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma apart from exagger@@ ated pl@@ atten@@ tively hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate In@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cardi@@ ac , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and severity of skin transactions , the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift , as well as the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ ko@@ ster@@ oid are given . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid and intake must be continued during the entire duration of therapy , as well as for more than 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate dose . &quot;
patients must also receive a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) during the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after each third payment cycle .
&quot; in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be created prior to each gift , a complete blood image , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a th@@ ru@@ mbo@@ genic cord . &quot;
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ates ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ame trans@@ am@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ Trans@@ am@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should amount to &lt; 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dosage check must take place among Ber@@ ück@@ cent of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity of the predic@@ tive therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applicable for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ ate@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Market C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 blood .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity ≥ degrees 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment &quot;
the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA has to be broken when in patients after 2 dos@@ is@@ redu@@ ci@@ o- or hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity or not @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity or so@@ - continues with degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical trials are no indication that patients aged 65 years old or over the age of 65 is an increased side @-@ risk risk compared to patients aged 65 .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data on un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able and effectiveness .
&quot; in clinical trials , patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min do not require a dosage adjustment necessary for all patients recommended dosage adjustment . &quot;
the data base in patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver care unit from &gt; the 1.5 @-@ times of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - boundary and / or trans@@ am@@ in@@ as@@ en@@ values of &gt; the 3 @-@ fold @-@ times of the upper limit value ( near liver metastatic breast ) or &gt; 5.@@ 0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metastatic ) is not investigated especially in the studies . &quot;
patients must be monitored with regard to the Kno@@ wing mark@@ ers and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be given to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ro@@ ph@@ i figure again has a value of more than 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mbo@@ genic number has again reached a value of more than 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ or@@ phic number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - the ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxicity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity such as ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degrees 3 / 4 Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was dis@@ regarded if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
&quot; therefore , all patients need to be treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ treated patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ l@@ actic measure for reduction of exercise @-@ related toxicity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ acid ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sali@@ vary ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ ti@@ - T@@ ens 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients , for which a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is intended , the intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients , in which these events occurred , they had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , existing hypertension or Diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant hydr@@ ation accumulation in trans @-@ cellular space , a dra@@ in@@ age of the ergometer will be observed before the surgery . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including M@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ous events , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , when this substance is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic active ingredients . &quot;
for this reason the simultaneous application atten@@ dees ( except yellow fever , this vaccination is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of an irreversible s@@ di@@ fication of the reproductive capacity is made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment - g@@ inn ins@@ isted to obtain advice on sperm conservation . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses can lead non @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ oxid@@ ants ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) to a decreased p@@ em@@ et@@ ened ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of a multip@@ ly occurrence of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is advisable when patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or Ac@@ e- t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid are used in high doses . &quot;
&quot; ( I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , avoided on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - T@@ ens 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as there is no data regarding the potential for interaction with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half day like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the state status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ality Rati@@ o ) if the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ un .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ alises in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - wor@@ ship@@ ments , are expected to be a serious birth defects during one application in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary and after careful ref@@ usal of the farm for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of an irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity is made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment begins , consult with respect to the sperm level . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ alizes into the mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects in the embro@@ i@@ dered inf@@ ant inf@@ ant cannot be ruled out .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and severity of unwanted effects which were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with Mes@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om , and the random@@ ized Cis@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed yields were counted as well as 16@@ 3 patients with Mes@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om , who received random@@ ized Cis@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;

the probability of appearance in gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase when alli is taken along with a fat @-@ fat individual diet or fat @-@ fat diet .
&quot; because the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by an improved metabolic control , patients , who take a medicine against diabetes , before starting a therapy with alli , consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic may need to be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; patients , as well as medicines for hypertension or an increased cholesterol level , should consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage is to be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ations , in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea possible failure of the oral contrac@@ eption ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
both in a study on interactions of medicines as well as in several cases with the current use of Or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a reduction of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in plastic bars .
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with Or@@ list@@ at could be influenced the Quick @-@ values ( internationally normal , rati@@ o , IN@@ R ) ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients who were treated in clinical studies up to 4 full years with Or@@ list@@ at remained the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E , and K as well as the beta carot@@ eno@@ ins in norm@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be recommended before bed@@ time a supplement of the mul@@ tiv@@ itam@@ ins should take place in order to ensure sufficient vitamins ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of an Ein@@ mal@@ d@@ osis Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on , a limited number of volunteers , which at the same time received a slight decrease of the Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of Or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented . &quot;
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not invaluable ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of known what side effects were detected after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at is not known , since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of a certain magnitude . &quot;
&quot; it is plau@@ si@@ bly , that treatment with alli can lead to convert with regard to possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal effects . &quot;
single @-@ ins of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multi @-@ tra@@ ilers of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered for a period of 15 days at norm@@ ative and obes@@ e Pro@@ ban@@ den without any significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of the cases reported by Or@@ list@@ at @-@ transfers , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of Or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on studies at human and animal may be assumed by a fast recall @-@ based system , which are due to the passive characteristics of Or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
the therapeutic effect is set in the lum@@ ens and the upper intest@@ ine through kov@@ al relationship to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the ga@@ str@@ ischen and Pan@@ cre@@ atic Li@@ pas@@ sover .
&quot; clinical studies have been derived that 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food waste . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ em@@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 occupy the effectiveness of 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ cr@@ or@@ ical , fatty diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , has been assessed as follows : as a change of body weight in the course of course ( table 1 ) and as percentage of those respon@@ dents , who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction over 12 months has been observed , the largest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in the overall cholester@@ in was with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.2 % ( initial value 5.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of the L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols was with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value : 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( initial value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; for cap@@ ill@@ ary @-@ circum@@ ference , the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.@@ 6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) . &quot;
Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations of non @-@ metabolic or@@ list@@ at were not measurable 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg Or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , for therapeu@@ tical dos@@ ages in the plasma was not only spor@@ adic@@ ally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ l ) and without sign of cum@@ ulation . &quot;

&quot; the most common side effects depend on the effect of the capsules , and thereby arise that multip@@ lies fat from the body . &quot;
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after treatment of treatment since you might not have reduced the fat content in your diet as well .
&quot; with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize the nutritional supplements : • Beg@@ inning already a few days , or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fatty diet . • learning more about the usual fat content of your favourite dish and about the size of the portions that you normally take to yourself . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the likelihood you need to exceed your fat limit . • Use your recommended amount even@@ ly on the daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat that you may take for each meal , not to take them in the form of a fat meal or a reasonable after@@ ti@@ ring , as you possibly do it with other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in which these con@@ ges@@ tions are learning to control them by adapting their diets . &quot;

the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a drug that can be used as anti @-@ drug ) .
&quot; the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , as to the effects contained in this age group does not have enough information . &quot;
&quot; this means that the active ingredient prevents the relationship of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , to the recept@@ ors in the gut . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi investig@@ ates in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adults , who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate trig@@ gers for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; chemotherapy reg@@ imen , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 59 % of the patients treated with alo@@ xi ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron &apos;s patients ( 126 from 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; chemotherapy reg@@ imen , the moderate trig@@ gers for nausea and vom@@ iting are , showed 81 % of the patients treated with alo@@ xi ( 15@@ 3 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron &apos;s patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on these values are 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission distributed Helsinki @-@ Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . approval for the transport sector of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union . &quot;
al@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting at strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer disease and prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting at moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting that is induc@@ ed by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be reinforced by adding one before the chemotherapy given Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids .
da Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron is able to extend the colorectal cancer patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ nesty Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ marine I@@ le@@ us after injection .
&quot; however , like with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advisable at the current gift of Pal@@ on@@ osis tron with medicines that prolon@@ gs the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t- interval is extended or which tend to be a pro@@ long@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with another Chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics gift , Alo@@ xi should not be used in the days following chemotherapy nor for the treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical studies inhi@@ bited Pal@@ on@@ osis , the immune @-@ oriented activity of the five examined chemotherapy treatments ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ or , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;
in a clinical study did not show any significant pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron and a ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration or@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds of a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors .
&quot; in a population based pharmac@@ o@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ induc@@ es ( D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ ons , ca@@ ox@@ etine , semi @-@ sk@@ inn@@ tin , ca@@ ox@@ etine , chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r , tractor and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) has no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron . &quot;
&quot; experiences concerning the application of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron in human pregn@@ ancies are not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ otic tron should not be used in pregnant women , unless it is considered to be necessary from the treating the doctor . &quot;
clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observed side effects ( total of 6@@ 33 patients ) that were at least possibly with alo@@ xi in connection with headaches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were indicated in post @-@ marketing experiences . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage showed similar frequencies of undes@@ irable events as in the other do@@ ves ; there were no dose of activity to observe .
&quot; there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies carried out , due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy with a Alo@@ xi@@ - Over@@ do@@ zation . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ized double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients , received a moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ or , with patients compared to 32 mg On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 7,@@ 3 hours ) , which was given on day 1 without D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ per intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients , which received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ or and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams Pal@@ on@@ uc@@ tron , with patients compared to the 32 mg On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron , which were given on day 1 intraven@@ ously . &quot;
results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for indications of chemotherapy induc@@ ed nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron on blood pressure , heart rate and E@@ KG parameter , including the Q@@ T@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron and Dol@@ as@@ etric . &quot;
&quot; according to the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron has the ability to block the i@@ v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ pol@@ arization involved in the ion@@ als and extend the duration of the potential for action . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy doctoral researchers was to assess the E@@ KG effects of i.@@ V. in individual bi@@ osis of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg . &quot;
Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follows an initi@@ als of the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations in a slow elimination of the body with an average duration of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally included in the whole dos@@ is@@ field of 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ / kg with gestures and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ osis , 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average sized average ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ osis tron Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; from pharmac@@ o@@ cr@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , that at once a daily intraven@@ ous gift of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron in 3 consecutive days reached overall tex@@ position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the equivalent of 0.@@ 75 mg total of 0.@@ 75 mg higher . however , the C@@ max was higher than 0.@@ 75 mg higher . &quot;
approximately 40 % will be eliminated via the kidneys and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abol@@ ites which have compared to Pal@@ on@@ otic tron over less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect at the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor .
in @-@ vit@@ ro studies for met@@ alli@@ zation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser extent that I@@ so@@ da enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron . &quot;
&quot; Eli@@ min@@ ation After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron , approximately 80 % of the dose were recovered within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron as an imm@@ utable active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a unique intraven@@ ous bol@@ ting injection , the total physical activity was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in patients with severe liver herbs the termin@@ ale elimination period and the average systemic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ osis tron is increased , a reduction of dose is therefore justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical trials these effects were observed only after positions which are considered adequate above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for the clinical use . &quot;
10 from pre@@ clinical trials are indications that Pal@@ on@@ osis may only be involved in very high concentrations of ion@@ als that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ fici@@ ally and re@@ pol@@ arization and will prolong the potential for shareholders .
&quot; high doses Pal@@ on@@ osis tron ( each dose is correspon@@ ded in about the 30 of the therapeutic exposure when people ) , which were given daily over two years , led to a multip@@ ly frequency of liver tum@@ ors , pituitary gland , pancre@@ atic mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the used high dos@@ ages and da Alo@@ xi determined by humans for unique application , the relevance of these results is deemed to be low for humans . &quot;
the owner of this approval for the transport must be adopted by the European Commission on the schemes for the transport company within the framework of this decision .

June 2006 The Committee for Pharmac@@ eutical Research ( CH@@ MP ) passed a negative award in which the approval of approval for the transport of hepatitis C is intended to be used for the treatment of hepatitis C with Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injections .
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon is similar to a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same phar@@ ma @-@ effective component , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; Refer@@ ences &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long prolonged ) Hepatitis C ( one by a viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic examination the liver tissue points out damage , in addition , the values of liver enzyme im@@ in- Amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increased in the blood standard . &quot;
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to stimulating this to the formation of the drug .
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon placed data that occupy the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active structure , composition and purity of the medication by means of activity , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
in the study of patients with hepatitis C the effectiveness of Al@@ ph@@ eon has been compared with the effectiveness of the reference agency by 4@@ 55 patients .
&quot; in the study it was measured , as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 therapy sessions as well as 6 months after setting treatment on the medication ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;

&quot; furthermore , concerns have been expressed thoroughly , that the data on the stability of the substance and of the drug @-@ to @-@ market drug is not sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , who spoke to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical trial . &quot;
&quot; following the treatment of the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease increased to more patients than with the reference basis ; moreover Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the test was evaluated in the study to investigate the question of how far the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
it can be used to treat im@@ peti@@ go ( one with cr@@ ust formation associated skin infection ) and small inclu@@ sions ( R@@ iss@@ - or cutting ) , sc@@ rub@@ ble and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; al@@ tar@@ go is not supposed to be used for treating infections , which were demonstr@@ ably or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ res@@ ent st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because aler@@ go against this type of infections may not affect . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied to patients from the age of nine months , but patients under the age of 18 must not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not speak to treatment after two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it acts by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial pla@@ que in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
&quot; the main indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients , whose infection was deduc@@ ted after the end of the treatment . &quot;
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.@@ 1 % ) of the 71 patients with placebo on treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected Hau@@ tw@@ ei@@ ds , Al@@ tar@@ go and Cef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar contact : when the results of both studies were taken together at Hau@@ tw@@ unden , they spoke about 90 % of the patients of both groups to treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go was caused during the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( eit@@ ed hollow rooms in the body tissue ) or infections that were demonstr@@ ably or presumably caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which has been observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the cutting edge .
&quot; the Committee for Pharmac@@ euticals ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go can prevail over the short @-@ time treatment of the following superficial skin infections regarding the risks : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • infected small in@@ ab@@ ations , de@@ ton@@ ations or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
may 2007 the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . approval for the transport sector of Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union .
&quot; patients , with which no improvement is shown within two or three days , are to be investigated once more and an alternative therapy will be considered ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of raising awareness or severe local irritation , the treatment is broken through the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment has been carefully ab@@ stain@@ ed and an adequate alternative treatment of the infection began . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not supposed to be used for treating infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical studies in secondary studies , the effectiveness of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin used in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ot@@ tom@@ less st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) . &quot;
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 - 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or worsen@@ ing of the infected spot .
the effect of simultaneous application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical funds on the same skin surface has not been examined and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the small Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations , which have been achieved in humans according to topical skin or infected superficial wounds , is a clin@@ ically relevant inhibit@@ or in vi@@ vo not to be expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 The simultaneous gift of 2 times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Au@@ c ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max to top@@ ographic application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ be on the poor skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low systematic exposure to topical application in patients , tin @-@ adap@@ tations may not be used if topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ism after oral intake and are inadequate with regard to a statement on the birth and the feder@@ ate / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy if a top@@ ic anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly inde@@ xed and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to prefer@@ able the gift of a systemic antibiotic .
&quot; when deciding if the breastfeeding continued / ended , or the therapy with al@@ tar@@ go will be continued / ended , between the benefits of breastfeeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefits of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies on 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was applied , the most frequently reported side effect of irritation at the place of place , which looked about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; effect Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic derivatives of P@@ ill@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ anus ) . &quot;
the drug mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective im@@ itation of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a certain t@@ lag of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ oms which differ from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti @-@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the binary point of protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the Bosnian P @-@ binary interface and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ as@@ e@@ center .
&quot; due to the bond at this t@@ len@@ eck hem@@ men pe@@ sh@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , block partially P @-@ binary interactions and preventing the normal education of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local prevalence of resistance to the resistance of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin , the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should appear with at least some infection forms , should consult a consultation through experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin against S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ icillin . &quot;
&quot; in the case of failure to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional Vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din should be considered . &quot;
&quot; Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ be was served daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and bev@@ elled skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days at the top@@ ographic treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plastic problem were obtained . &quot;
the test took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients each before the medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual system inclusion of man according to topical application of 1 % s@@ ine is fed to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; Au@@ c ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 @-@ times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ or . &quot;

&quot; there was neither with male nor female rats signs of reduced fer@@ til@@ ity at oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby one up to 5 @-@ times higher exposure was achieved as the highest estimated exposure in humans ( top@@ ographic application on 200 c@@ m2 of poor skin ) : &quot;

the holder of approval for the transpor@@ ting needs to make sure that a pharmaceutical cover system is present as in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application . version 6.@@ 2 ) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the product market is being marketed .
&quot; the holder of approval for the transport network is obliged to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical requirements , as described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) and in the module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application , as well as all additional updates by the R@@ MP , which are agreed with the CH@@ MP . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years which are not im@@ mu@@ te against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of one of two doses existing vaccines and a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when the immune system consists of a low risk of hepatitis B infection and it is ensured that the vacc@@ inations of two doses can be brought to an end . &quot;
if a refres@@ her dose is required against hepatitis A or B can be given ambi@@ rix or any other Hepatitis A@@ - or -@@ B vaccine .
&quot; vaccines have an effect by bringing the immune system ( the natural def@@ ying of the body ) , &quot; as it can fight against an illness . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognises the immune system and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same elements as that of 1996 @-@ approved vaccine Twin@@ rix adults and who has been approved since 1997 .
&quot; the three vaccines are applied to protection against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix will be administered as part of any of three doses . &quot;
&quot; because ambient rix and Twin@@ rix adults were identical , some of the data , which support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as proof of the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection of a protective anti@@ body concentrations .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to a six month @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two injections .
Ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection on the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of ambient rix was similar to a six @-@ month gap between the injections .
&quot; the most common side effects of ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine ) are head@@ ache , appetite , pain at inj@@ ecting , redness , mat@@ ness ( ti@@ redness ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may not be applied in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients ; one of the other components or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) are not used .
August 2002 shared the European Commission G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als s.@@ a. a permit for the transport of ambi@@ rix in the whole
&quot; the standardization plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose is administered at the appointment of the choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , it may be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ents vaccines or with a combination of material . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis B and anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) -@@ anti@@ body values are in the same size as after the vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ents vaccines .
&quot; it is not yet fully backed , whether immun@@ ologically competent persons who have raised to a Hepatitis A@@ - vaccination , as it may also be protected by immun@@ ological antibodies as they may not be protected by immun@@ ologic memory . &quot;
3 As with all injections should be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine corresponding options of medical treatment and supervision .
&quot; if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination of material , the 360 ELISA test @-@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ antes hepatitis @-@ B surface . &quot;
&quot; with hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with mal@@ functions of the immune system , under circumstances no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies can be achieved so that in these cases the gift of other vacc@@ inations may be required . &quot;
since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could result in the glut@@ e@@ al muscle to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ fer@@ ent success should these injections should be avoided .
&quot; however , it can be inj@@ ected to Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ genic top@@ en@@ ie or bleeding disorders , as it may occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift to bleeding . &quot;
&quot; when Ambi@@ rix had been administered in the second living year in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ anus , in@@ activated police vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ on m@@ umps vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or in patients with immun@@ def@@ ective , they have to be assumed that maybe no adequate immune response is achieved . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , which has been carried out with 3 vacc@@ inations of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , tur@@ ro@@ ent@@ eric , headaches and fever was comparable with the frequency that has been observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ ations and preser@@ vatives . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vaccines have been administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ c@@ anned combination . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ iness on a calculation basis per vacc@@ in@@ osis ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the trial , compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the Pro@@ ban@@ den after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses . &quot;
&quot; according to the complete vaccination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the Pro@@ ban@@ den which had administered ambi@@ rix had been vacc@@ inated about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the Pro@@ ban@@ den , which have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dosage absorption . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of mat@@ ness was however compared to a pro@@ band ( i.e. about the entire vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the Pro@@ ban@@ den , which received ambi@@ rix , compared to 3@@ 6.@@ 2 % in the Pro@@ ban@@ den , which received the 3 @-@ cans com@@ partments ) . &quot;
the frequency of ho@@ oked pain and mat@@ ness was low and comparable to the administration of the com@@ pex vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vaccine scheme was observed .
&quot; in a comparative study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ inations , the appearance of local reactions and univers@@ ality was comparable with the associated with the 3 @-@ doses form@@ at@@ in@@ activ@@ ated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; however with the 6@@ - to 11@@ - J@@ olds , however , after vaccination with Ambi@@ rix , was a common occurrence of pain ( at the injection ) per dose , not pro pro@@ band . &quot;
&quot; the share of vacc@@ inations , which reported on serious side @-@ effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine schem@@ as with the combination of 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B@@ - surface an@@ tigen , was not different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , which were conducted at vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ converted rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ o@@ converted rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4,@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study that was carried out at 12@@ - up to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two doses ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combination with three doses . &quot;
&quot; for the 2@@ 89 individuals whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was undeni@@ able , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ or rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine was significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which were obtained in a clinical trial study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old a month after the full vaccine series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the table below . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ inations were either a 2 @-@ doses vaccine scheme with ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine scheme with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ less in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface .
persons who were at the time the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ il@@ isation between 12 and 15 years old could be demonstrated the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies over at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 month vaccine scheme .
the immune reaction against both Anti@@ gens was comparable to that which was formed after vaccination of 3 doses consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface in a tin volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - up to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old could be shown that the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies can be compared 24 months after immun@@ isation in 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vaccine scheme is to be compared to the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vaccine scheme .
&quot; if the first dose of ambient rix had been administered at the same time with the refres@@ hes of a combined Di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a- , in@@ activ@@ ated Poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us , in@@ activated police vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined mas@@ quar@@ es ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined mas@@ ern m@@ umps vaccine . it was the immune response to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
&quot; a clinical trial , which was performed with 3 doses of the current formulation of adults , showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ary and Ser@@ o@@ converted rates as for the former formulation . &quot;
the vaccine is both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing with regard to any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes to investigate .

&quot; the Hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways such as by bathing in water @-@ poll@@ uted waters . &quot;
&quot; you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow @-@ looking ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix cannot be fully protected against infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / Your Child are already infected with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus already with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child can &apos;t feel uncomfortable or ill / feels ) a vaccine may not prevent an illness .
&quot; a protection against other infections that are damaging the liver or cause symptoms , which are similar to those according to a hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection , cannot be conve@@ yed . &quot;
• If you have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express itself through it@@ ching skin attacks , breathing not or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have performed an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B. if you / your child has a serious infection with fever . &quot;
• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B quickly ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usually intended administration of the second vaccination dosage ) .
&quot; with a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccine with ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined Hepatitis A@@ - / hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective components ( 360 ELISA @-@ A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ inations of this vaccine with decreased content of effective components is usually administered one month after the first dose and is likely to give your child a ino@@ cul@@ ation protection from the end of the vaccine .
&quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ rix will suffer from individuals who suffer from severe blood @-@ minded distur@@ ban@@ ces , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weak@@ ened due to a disease or treatment in your / her body &apos;s self @-@ defense / or if you / your child undergo a her@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases but the immune response of these persons on vaccination can not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is .
21 Do you take your doctor if you / your child can take further medicines ( including those that you may have been vacc@@ inated with no prescription ) or if you / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated / was administered or Imm@@ ung@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) have been administered or is planned in the near future .
but it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the individual is not protected against one or both Hepatitis A and B viruses .
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs . &quot;
&quot; if ambi@@ rix shall be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be enough . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packaging to 1 and 10 with or without any need@@ les and in packaging to 50 without any need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which have been known since the division of the first approval for the transpor@@ ters , the CH@@ MP entered the view that the benefits @-@ risk of ambient rix will remain positive . &quot;
&quot; however , Ambi@@ rix had only been placed in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure . &quot;
am@@ mon@@ y can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete en@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ e@@ tic En@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high am@@ moni@@ ac@@ al concentrations ) in the pre@@ history .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps is divided - split by several individual pants to meals - swal@@ lowed , under the food mixed or via a guest stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ also ( through the stomach blan@@ ket in the stomach of leading hose ) or a nose son@@ de ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , since Am@@ mon@@ y could not be compared with another treatment or with placebo ( a search@@ able medicine , that is , without substance ) . &quot;
&quot; am@@ mon@@ y can also cause loss of loss , an abnormal aci@@ dity in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , vom@@ iting , vom@@ iting , vom@@ iting , vom@@ iting , vom@@ iting , rash , rash , rash , in@@ convenient body odor or weight increase . &quot;
the Committee for Pharmac@@ euticals ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle to high am@@ moni@@ tions is effective .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was authorised &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; because due to the r@@ arity of the illness at the time of approval just limited information on this medicine . &quot;
&quot; the use is inde@@ xed with all patients , where a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ ous lack is already manifested in the New Cre@@ ate Age ( within the first 28 life@@ times ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ ac form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective , which manifes@@ ts itself after the first life mon@@ at ) , there is an indication for use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ograph encephal@@ opathy consists . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with slip disorders is AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS also available in Gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form . &quot;
the daily dose is calculated individually by taking into account the protein intolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as with adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from an early mani@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ ec@@ yl , the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
patients with a Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ ase deficiency need to receive arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets must not be administered for patients with slip disorders because a risk for the formation of Ö@@ sop@@ ho@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a is if the tablets are unable to enter the stomach immediately .
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , accordingly 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium in@@ sensitivity and o@@ cular clinical conditions with caution .
since Met@@ abol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is carried out over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution . &quot;
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slo@@ wing of the neur@@ onal offen@@ se and an increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
it also found a delayed irritation of cerebral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be established if phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is left into the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during the lac@@ tation period is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS entered at 56 % of patients at least one undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these undes@@ irable events was assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a probable @-@ toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from a 18 year old abnormal patient , which developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ es@@ aci@@ as , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripher@@ al N@@ europ@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of an over@@ dose stood at a 5 month old small child with a lon@@ ged single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go along with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed up to 400 mg / kg / day a dose of limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active connection that is characterized by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is passed through the kidneys .
&quot; tri@@ chi@@ om@@ etri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nit@@ rogen . &quot;
5 patients with disrup@@ tions of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram has been produced sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment immediately started to improve the survival chances and the clinical result .
&quot; the prognosis of the early mani@@ ac form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in the New Cre@@ ate age was almost always inf@@ est , and the disease himself led to treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their sti@@ cking @-@ free an@@ alo@@ ga in the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; by her@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative ways of nit@@ rogen waste ( sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ru@@ pul@@ ous K@@ ost and possibly substitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of Neu@@ so@@ ener in post @-@ part@@ al ( however within the first life @-@ month ) diagnostic diseases on 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rates were 100 % , but even in these patients there was time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ ac form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ots form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ ase defect ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ oton@@ ous En@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a prot@@ ein@@ ous diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neurological deficits are hardly rever@@ sible in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is generated in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its Met@@ abol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined according to the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at by so@@ ber healthy adults and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous gift of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form were determined 15 minutes after the intake of metall@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
&quot; in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cycli@@ cal disorders or hem@@ o@@ wever , according to different doses phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma . &quot;
&quot; three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single users ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate con@@ centric in the third day five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ased within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the conve@@ ying product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine over the kidneys .
&quot; according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us testing , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at had been treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic substances ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules will either be taken by oral ( infants and children who have not swal@@ low tablets , or patients with slip disorders ) or via a guest stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ also or a no@@ stri@@ de . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as with adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um prot@@ eine in the plasma should be kept inside the normal range . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from an early mani@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ ec@@ yl , the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
if rat feder@@ ations were exposed before birth Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active Met@@ abo@@ lit by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) it came to lesi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the brain rin@@ se .
&quot; a probable @-@ toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from a 18 year old abnormal patient , which developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ es@@ aci@@ as , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripher@@ al N@@ europ@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; tri@@ chi@@ om@@ etric has seen phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess of excess . &quot;
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that every gram has been produced sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acid glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
&quot; existing neurological deficits are also hardly rever@@ sible in the treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur . &quot;
&quot; according to an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ in in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after the intake measurement of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can save the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; during this procedure , the small measuring spo@@ on includes 0,@@ 95 g , the average measurement of 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
if a patient has to get the medication about a probe can be dissolved AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS before the use also in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is up to 5 grams in 10 ml of water ) .
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases are missing particular liver enzymes , so that they are the sti@@ tial waste products that accum@@ ulate after consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if you are conducted laboratory studies , you must inform the doctor that AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS take that you can affect AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can affect the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period you are not allowed to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine could skip to mother &apos;s milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , con@@ fu@@ ci@@ ousness , head@@ ache , taste disorders , descendants of the hearing , dis@@ oriented , memory , and a deterioration of existing neurological states . &quot;
&quot; if you find one of these symptoms in yourself , you immediately put yourself in contact with your doctor or the emergency of your hospital at the beginning of a corresponding treatment . &quot;
if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for example , in fragile Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dinal ( heart attack ) without &quot; &quot; ST@@ - &quot; &quot; ( an anom@@ aly ) value at electro@@ cardi@@ o@@ gram or E@@ KG . &quot;
&quot; if An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to the prevention of blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this may help in patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow towards the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox at some gift or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ ic @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ine ) with pi@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and an GP@@ I was compared . &quot;
&quot; while PCI was often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube ) used in the arteries , to prevent a closure , and they additionally received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart accidents or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year in total as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who subjected to PCI was An@@ gi@@ ox in terms of all indicators just as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for heavy bleeding , with which it was considerably more effective than pi@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , other deer or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be applied to patients who recently had a blood pressure , as well as with people with strong hypertension or severe kidney problems or heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Pharmac@@ euticals ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI a decent replacement for He@@ par@@ in .
September 2004 shared the European Commission The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd received approval for the transport of An@@ gi@@ ox within the European Union .
for treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ina / non @-@ mid@@ - ST @-@ lever ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) in case of an emergency treatment or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bol@@ ting of 0.@@ 1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is carried out in further succession , an additional bolt from 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery on 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h will be increased . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately prior to the procedure , a bol@@ ting of 0.5 mg / kg is administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bol@@ ting of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one in immediately subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened by 225 seconds , should be a second cycle of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the constitu@@ tive and dil@@ uted drug should be carefully mixed before the application and the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis should be administered quickly intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided that 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose will be properly administered . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney disease , ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) who are treated to a PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine against ACS , or not ) , should be used a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; lies the ACT value under 225 seconds , is a second cycle dose of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis once again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in authorisation , the ACT value 5 minutes after the gift of the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients is contra@@ indicated ( see under Section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be taken 30 minutes after the completion of the intraven@@ ous hegemon@@ ial Gift from in@@ quired He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous formulation of low molecular si@@ par@@ in .

patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a blood pressure especially if bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if in PCI patients under bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , most of the bleeding may occur at arter@@ ial score points , patients , who undergo a per@@ tin@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , during the treatment in principle everywhere bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in patients , waiting far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine should be considered to ensure the value of the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine should be achieved again , prior to treatment existing level . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge of the active mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tics or Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ genic aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these active ingredients increase the danger of blood pressure . &quot;

both in the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine group and in people treated with s@@ wis@@ ely compared to women as well as in patients over 65 years more often more undes@@ irable events than with male or younger patients .
severe bleeding were defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and TI@@ MI scales for heavy bleeding such as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred among Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine alone significantly less frequently than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dated din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; a AC@@ U@@ ITY serious bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ extrac@@ tive blood cell or blood circulation in a point area , which required a radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , with diameter ≥ 5 g / d@@ l without obvious blood@@ stream , re@@ operation due to a blood circulation , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , young people and children from six years with diabetes , which need treatment with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) in the abdom@@ inal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm or as a permanent fusion with a ins@@ ulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not have sufficient ins@@ ulin to regulating the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or which ins@@ ulin can be processed effectively .
&quot; ins@@ ulin gene is very slightly different from human@@ ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it works faster and a shorter period of time than a short @-@ effective human@@ ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body does not produce ins@@ ulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; with type 2 diabetes , in which the body ins@@ ulin can not be re@@ worked effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ li@@ zed hem@@ ost@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes after six months a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in ins@@ ulin .
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in humane standard . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine or one of the other components , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose level .
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission announced the company San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH approval for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the whole of the European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is considered a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , either in the area of the abdom@@ inal blan@@ ket , of the cap or del@@ tam@@ us@@ k@@ el or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdom@@ inal thickness . &quot;
&quot; due to the decreased glucose capacity and the dimin@@ ished ins@@ ulin transfer , the ins@@ ulin need to be down in patients with a restriction of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of action , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , of ins@@ ulin ( normal , N@@ PH , galvan@@ ized etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) , and / or the production method can draw up a change of ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 A insufficient dosage or demo@@ lition of treatment , particularly in patients with an ins@@ ular diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ esis ; these conditions are potentially viable . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another ins@@ ulin or ins@@ ulin in a different manufacturer should take place under strict physician supervision and can make a change of dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the ins@@ ulin used and can therefore change in the conversion of the treatment schem@@ as .
&quot; to increase the substances that increase blood sugar and reinforce the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( ACE ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , dis@@ g@@ ates , fluid oxid@@ ants , fluid oxide , sc@@ anned , sc@@ anned and sul@@ fon@@ dness antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; additionally , under the effect of sympath@@ iz@@ e@@ dic@@ s such as beta @-@ loose , c@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and reserves the symptoms of ep@@ in@@ ep@@ in@@ ep@@ ted counter @-@ regulation will be wat@@ ered or absent . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on the Re@@ productive Tox@@ ic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine and human@@ ins@@ ulin in regard to the pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , the birth or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether ins@@ ulin enters into human breast milk , but in general , ins@@ ulin occurs either into the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral use . &quot;
&quot; in the following are the clinical trials listed in clinical trials , group@@ ed according to system organs and sorted according to decreasing incidence of their occurrence ( very frequently : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on availability ) . &quot;
&quot; cold @-@ welding , cool@@ ness and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual creation , or weakness , confusion , concentration sn@@ ap , excessive Hun@@ - ger , changes of vision , head@@ ache , nausea and heart . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ pod@@ stream@@ lined tri@@ d failed , to change the injection method within the injection range , can occur in the result of a Li@@ pod@@ stream@@ ph@@ ie at the inj@@ ecting location . &quot;
&quot; heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ics with awareness can be treated by means of an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injections ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a trained person or treated by intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor . &quot;
&quot; after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and similar episodes . &quot;
ins@@ ulin lo@@ wers the blood sugar level by stimulating the peripher@@ al glucose ( in particular by skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by the im@@ itation of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes showed that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be of ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine the efficiency comes faster and the time is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em @-@ ins@@ ulin .
&quot; in a study conducted with 18 male persons at the age of 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes , ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine showed a dose of 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0.@@ 3 E / kg or more a lower increase in glucose effect , just like human@@ ins@@ ulin . &quot;
ins@@ ulin gene has twice as rapid impact as normal human@@ ins@@ ulin and achieves the full glucose effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human ins@@ ulin .
&quot; from the data it was clear that when an application of ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ is@@ ine is reached in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ous gly@@ cem@@ ic control is reached , such as human conserv@@ ins@@ ulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine was born in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale control was given as a human @-@ normal hill , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ ulin is used in 15 minutes by the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control is given as human @-@ standard in@@ ulin , which is given 2 mi@@ xes before the meal ( see picture 1 ) . &quot;
ins@@ ulin gene in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before the start of the meal in comparison to human normal hill @-@ ulin ) before the start of the meal was given ( figure 1@@ A ) as well as compared to human normal standard ( figure 1@@ A ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
ins@@ ulin gene in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after the start of the meal compared to human Nor@@ el@@ mal@@ ins@@ ulin - the 2 minutes ( normal ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) was given .
