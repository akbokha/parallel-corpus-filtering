<seg id="6">"Abilify is used to treat severe to severe Manic episodes and the prevention of Manic episodes in patients, who have addressed the drug in the past."</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is applied to quick control of gestational anxiety or behavioral disorders when the orale intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both disorders can apply the solution to the insertion or the melt-coated tablets in patients where the slip of tablets difficulties are prepared.</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who are taking other medicines just like Abilify, the dose should be adapted to Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells among each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole appears probably mainly as "partial Agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazole such as 5 hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less dimensions than the neurotransmitters affects the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"as dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole carries to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms and their reoccur will be prevented."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of albilify to prevent the reoccur of symptoms, was examined in three studies of up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of the injection solution has been compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which were compared to increased unrest, over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study Abilify was compared to twelve weeks to 347 patients with semi-operated dol, in a different study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo, which had been stabilized to 160 patients, in which the Ottoman symptoms had already been stabilized with axfy."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the effectiveness of bilical injection solution was conducted in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which was in gested restlessness, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies the change in the symptoms of patients has been studied by a standard therapy for bipolar disorder, or the number of patients who spoke to treatment languages."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the company also led studies through to investigate, how the body absorbs the melt-coated tablets and the solution to the entry."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection solution showed patients who received Abilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of gested anxiety as the patients who received a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"when applied to the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify in four of the five short-term studies have been more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks long more effective than placebo the re-encounter manic episodes in previously treated patients, and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">Bilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms gested restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify for insertion (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapic pyramidal, vomiting (trepation), vomiting (trepation), saliva, fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Pharmaceuticals (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify, in treating schizophrenia and the prevention of a new manic episode in patients, who had predominantly some manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes responded to the treatment with Aripiprazole, facing the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"moreover, the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injecting solution in the fast control of increased unrest and behavioral disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes, if an oral therapy is not suitable to prevail over the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004 shared the European Commission of Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the transport sector of Abilify throughout the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient, a lower Initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"when the CYP3A4 induction is set out of the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>

<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with itself overbearing side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2-Antprotagonist Famotidin, a stomach acid blocker, reduces the remnapping rate of Aripiprazole, whereby this effect is considered clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy promoters increased a highly effective CYP2D6-Inhibitor (Chinidin) the Auc of Aripiprazole around 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects have and therefore should be made similar dosage reductions."</seg>
<seg id="52">With CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") Metabolisians can result the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasmakonzentrations compared to CYP2D6 extensionists.</seg>
