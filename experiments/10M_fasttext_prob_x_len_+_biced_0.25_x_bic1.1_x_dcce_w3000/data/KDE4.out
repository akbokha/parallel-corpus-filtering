you can translate the Web site in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; menu under ex@@ tras . select from the folding list the output and target language of translation .
&quot; if a part of the text is selected , this part of the whole &amp; URL will only be translated . &quot;
machine translation are only very rudi@@ mentary . bab@@ el@@ fish produces in the best case a crude translation and in worst case nonsense . therefore the translations do not make an important decisions depending on the translation .
&quot; only web pages on the Internet can be translated . other texts , you should translate on the baby fish page yourself , where you can insert @-@ translated texts directly . &quot;
&quot; the package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they provide some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier available . &quot;
further information on the use of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions .... open the lists and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of standard modules from the package k@@ ills ; add @-@ ons . please note that maybe more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the package base , install the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the cras@@ hing module , click in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras . then you can view the page , the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of down@@ fall , if available , delete . &quot;
the module Reg@@ .@@ filter ( also called folder filters ) can be reached in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ tras filter . with the module you can filter &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to view the DO@@ M component in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; to use ex@@ tras DO@@ M @-@ tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document , example : document@@ aries , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this throw @-@ junction . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type I@@ node / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different tool@@ bar and text views so as to view the content of your local data system .
&quot; the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in it , conce@@ aled folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree @-@ map graphi@@ cally . each object is represented with a rect@@ angle , whose area is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of sub@@ ordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a file or folder , the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the file . therefore , large files , even if it can be easily seen in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View may be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; commands may be considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ vi representation is a rect@@ angle , which represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . to simplify navigation , the spelling of useful colours and let@@ tering settings . &quot;
&quot; the colour of a rect@@ angle , which is switched on screen mode , can either be depth for the light detection of the ti@@ tu@@ e@@ fe or representation of a different file of file such as name , owners , group or M@@ IM@@ E type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each property , you can specify if there is enough space to display or if the area errors are available through restrictions on the sign of the Tre@@ er . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of let@@ tering in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; in Dar@@ ing algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ j in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always observed . note that less space is lost for the frame , if the rect@@ angle is quad@@ r@@ atic . &quot;
&quot; as division of the area of an entry for the sub@@ ordinate entries , the implementation is left . here it is designed for the let@@ tering and avoiding space losses by frame always beneficial to allow the area to arise that are as square @-@ square , the best methods of this are lines , columns or recur@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum area for an entry on the menu item view . instead , a smoking pattern is drawn into the area of the or@@ derly entry , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an assigned entry . &quot;
&quot; originally &amp; FS@@ View was originally designed , as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets , which was developed for the use K@@ C@@ ach@@ e@@ gr@@ ind . &quot;
the module picture gallery can be found in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; menu under the Extras picture gallery ... or with c@@ tr@@ l ; I .

&quot; a simple to use camera guide will be made available to you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; review ; of course , each medium and every card reader , which is supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; checking ; together . &quot;
&quot; review came ; contains a quick image processing with base imaging tools . you can use them to view and correct your photos , comment , review and correct . the processing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; checking came ; easy to use , it provides professional professional skills available . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color foam and all available modules support the raw conver@@ ting using li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G Export and ICC @-@ Color Administr@@ ative - Work@@ flow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more met@@ adata , such as on the camera or the lens , which can be searched for . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also available &amp; checking ; an open source project . that means , it is dependent on the support of the end users . therefore , they should report problems and improvement possibilities . &quot;
&quot; again , the det@@ ach of problems or improvements are as easy as possible for them . wherever you use the program , the help menu features an entry with a sub@@ stri@@ ction system . all required information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; &amp; checking came ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers have come to each other . if you are a regular users of &amp; checking , then we would like to answer any other users from &amp; checking ; however , you can soon ask yourself questions about other users &apos; mailing list , and hopefully soon ask yourself questions about other users . in this mailing list , however , you should not be mighty in this language . &quot;
you can also check the review ; homepage to visit news about released versions and other information about &amp; publication ;
&quot; the best start to get to &amp; checking ; to participate , is the registration in the developers mailing list . instructions on how to subscribe to the developers mailing list from &amp; checking . &quot;
&quot; when you start &amp; checking , you will be asked where you want to store your images and your database . you can select a local , remote or remot@@ ely folder . simply enter the folder symbol or click the folder symbol to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your machine . here , the data file is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you would like . &amp; checking , you will also use as Al@@ ben@@ Library . configuration checking K@@ am &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder , the images , as the basic folder . &amp; checking ; considers every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . during the passing of the folder you get a progress show like this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Do not come ; dur@@ es rec@@ alling the libr@@ arian ad in all its depth . you cannot close any sub@@ folder , unless it is in hidden folder . you can take an extraordinary folder ; you can get a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list will not take photos as symbols . you can change that by taking any photo from the album and take this on the folder symbol . more details about this can be found in the section albums . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the basic folder , you can set up in &amp; checking ; your digital camera set up . after that , you should learn how to manage My albums and my key@@ note to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ dat@@ e@@ Support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so you can easily handle it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ f library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help . &quot;
as you set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h de@@ coder settings and Ro@@ h work@@ flow .
&quot; a simple to use camera guide will be made available to you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; review ; of course , each medium and every card reader , which is supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; checking ; together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) to data transfer . the camera is then viewed as a USB mass storage device . the camera can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; version released ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association , which has an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to machines and other peripher@@ als competi@@ tively without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . since pictures in general are large files and transmis@@ sions are outdated . &amp; checking ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
&quot; li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ bex@@ if support , so the EX@@ IF support is needed by some li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera drivers . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not admit anything or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; checking came ; is how easy to extend his functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins @-@ Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; checking ; K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules of all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipulate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is considerably easier to update ; through writing a small module to supplement a function when the changes in &amp; checking came ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; pulling and drop pictures works everywhere : you can disc@@ ard an image in another part of the tree tree , via the horizontal divi@@ ding line or into another use window . the only limitation is the one image not in keywords , file list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file selection allows you to raise the most common : JP@@ EG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the tool@@ view . so the filtering is displayed on the fil@@ en@@ ame only when this ind leg view is also displayed . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ settings .
&quot; view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; put an organized view on your pictures . all the photos submitted by &amp; checking ; these albums can be stored on the hard disk , according to the name of their collection in the properties tab or after the date when the album has been created first . the date can be changed in the characteristics of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also add a scre@@ enshot directly to an album , select &quot;
&quot; to copy or move a picture from an album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . you can move it to the same type also several photos and move it to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album includes a collection of photos and the album properties , allowing you to add information about this collection . to access the album properties , click with the right mouse button on the album and edit the context menu button . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - collections : are a method to mark your albums , so you can choose among a common name , you can choose from the tool@@ bar or view albums by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections . &quot;
the album date : it is used when you sort out your albums by date with view albums by date sort .
&quot; the buttons El@@ t@@ ester , average , neu@@ ester : these put the date on the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . first , first attempts to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF data . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first enter an album in &amp; checking , the first image in the album is chosen as a symbol for the &quot; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; &quot; this will help you to print the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click on the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album @-@ preview &quot; &quot; button . additionally , you can draw the photo on the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included in a collection and collections can not be wasted .
&amp; checking came ; supports the input of key@@ word for individual photos in the area of my key@@ word on the left in the main window . album collections have a different effect . you can naturally use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the picture window provides you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures displayed in this album are displayed in the picture window . each photo will be displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these thumb@@ nails with the two lou@@ ver in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you open an album the first time you need to wait briefly , while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . this can be avoided in which you can create new thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; information about each image is displayed below the image preview . what information is , you can edit about settings ; set up the albums page and adjust the area of thumb@@ nails to your wishes . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails have help in help . if you let the mouse cursor a moment about an image . the scre@@ enshot above shows the main features including all the keywords of a photo . the scre@@ enshot above in the section introduction to the main window displays such help window .
photos are all about to see it with &amp; checking ; goes . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it fits . you can easily reach all the features that are available with &amp; checking ; you can easily reach via the context menu of the preview or the menu image in the menu bar . you can choose between the view of the images , a gas@@ h@@ au or the processing of images . &quot;
you can open the picture editing with a photo by clicking on either F@@ 4 image editing ... or select the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit ... click on the picture editing you can view your photos and edit them .
&quot; it can happen that &amp; checking came ; the functionality that you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the menu menu with the right mouse button , and how you can adapt it to your needs if your program is not checked , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that after processing through other image processing programs to problems with the met@@ adata in the picture . some programs do not save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from EX@@ IF@@ T and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; checking , there are two ways to shoot . the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select Dre@@ w . in the sub@@ menu , you can indicate the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , you can click with the right mouse button on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you maintain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you come up a photo from &amp; checking , it will be moved in the tr@@ ash@@ can of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . f@@ 8 image delete or ren@@ f if you prefer to really del@@ eting , you can use this by using Shift . discharge . &quot;
&quot; view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sl@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; organizes your photos by the data . &amp; review came ; used either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; when you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the Dat@@ alog@@ ger below in the file view , so that you can only be shown the photos of the selected days . &quot;
photos provided with key@@ word provides a flexible and powerful way to organize your photos and cat@@ alo@@ ise . tags are sti@@ ckers who can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo you can find the photo by selecting this key@@ word or search .
&quot; when a key@@ word is selected , all the photos , which were marked with this key@@ word , will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . you can also organize parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My sample @-@ con@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; together cl@@ ap , so you can find the keywords you can find easily . &quot;
&quot; the tags are stored in a database for quick access and im@@ balances in the IP@@ TC data fields of the picture , at least for JP@@ EG . so you can also use your tags in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new tags by clicking on &quot; &quot; My key@@ word &quot; &quot; or click on an existing key@@ word , and then select new key@@ word after you have a new key@@ word after you click on an existing key@@ word , this is the key@@ word for this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking the key@@ word with right mouse button and delete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a key@@ word by drag it to the desired position in the tree and disc@@ ard it . then a menu that gives you the option to move . a key@@ word can be at a time only once in a tree .
&quot; you can change the properties of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit the context menu , and you can change the name of the key@@ word and symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu as an album menu . additionally , you can draw the photo on the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to check &amp; checking ; s functionality with key@@ word to use , you must first select your photos with key@@ word : once you have chosen the photos you can click on the right word in the tree &amp; quot ; My sampling one ; alternatively , you can also click on the thumb@@ nail of the images and select from the context menu key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can select a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will display once you select one of the keywords for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event , where it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keywords , this is displayed under the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a key@@ word , in which you can click with the right mouse button menu of the photos and select from the tags menu . the menu only displays the keywords which have been assigned to the photo . &quot;
the tim@@ eline views shows a tempor@@ al h@@ isto@@ gram of the number of images per time unit . a selection framework can be moved via this h@@ isto@@ gram . to select a time frame you just need to click on the bottom @-@ rect@@ angle of the drop @-@ frame which indicates the tim@@ eline . this will display all related images in the main window .
&quot; in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . then , it appears in the list below . &quot;
&quot; cover all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , records , collections , dat@@ ast@@ ages , and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; Neb@@ u@@ ge search box is a small lamp the green when the search results will find . if you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all the pictures again displayed . if searching nothing , then the lamp will be red . &quot;
the advanced search tool is hidden in the rider on the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open it here you can save a simple search box like the one described above . you can save this search here as a live search that always fil@@ tered what you have entered as a search criterion . after you saved the f@@ d filters in the list .
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search is done . the results will be used in the search list in the main window . if you want to choose your choice after searching again , you just need to select the corresponding entry from the view My search list and select in its context menu option . &quot;
&quot; if you select Search , the form to input the search returns with the previously entered search tool . if you select as advanced search , the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for the search tool . further information can be found in section The tool for extending search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select in the context menu Search . &quot;
&quot; the first search makes you an extended search form with many search@@ parameters , with which you can search in certain fields from &amp; checking ; s database can be found . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set up the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . any option can be deleted by operators , or deleted from it . each option can link with other via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or limit ... link . in addition , you can create searching for the type &amp; quot ; AND NIC@@ HT@@ quot ; create . &quot;
&quot; checking comes ; character@@ izes each picture by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare it images by comparing these sig@@ natures . the lower the difference between two images , the more they correspond to . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar comments : this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar item . using a spon@@ ge , the selection can be increased or decreased . if you push a picture of somewhere over the symbol of the un@@ precise search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can let it fall there . &quot;
sketch : open @-@ hand colour : draw a quick sketch and version ; find the matching images . also here a spon@@ ge can be set .
&quot; this tab presents an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ ature . you can drag it onto a square . you press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to drag a square . all pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , this requires your images to Ge@@ o data . &quot;
&quot; in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter , then it will be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live @-@ level folder . &quot;
&quot; version came ; represents a bul@@ b in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . he works with all supported image formats , even raw files , together . &quot;
&quot; choose one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em ligh@@ tically add out of the context menu . the selection will be displayed on the screen menu and its window is opened , you can open the light table fast with L ex@@ tras . &quot;
&quot; from the preview bar , you can drag the pictures you want to compare to the left or right area of the window and place there . a small arrow shows you to which copy in the window area . if you can preview synchron@@ ize your copy in the window area . if you can preview synchron@@ ize the tool@@ bar and then you can compare it with the other image as well . thus , you can compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to select quickly from a picture series . if you use pa@@ ar@@ wise , navigate from the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures are automatically displayed in the fields of the box . the right adjacent picture is displayed in the right area . this simplified it through a series of similar pictures . &quot;
&quot; of course , the regular holes are also working directly from the lumin@@ tic , such as F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails . this makes it e.g. simple visual differences with exposure data to link .
&quot; at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in pi@@ voting function , which you can recognize in the crossed arrows . to keep the visible area of the picture , you need to click on this and the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressed then both images will show the same image . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works just as well as in other views . simply use the zoom ship under the images or c@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to get into the picture and to zoom . this happens in both pictures when you &apos;re in the mode Pre@@ view .
&quot; what is a digital inventory - away from the fashion word ? digital inventory considers every part of the process after the image has been made , sc@@ anned or digital photos store a form of digital inventory . most of us do not take this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool to secure a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , use , protect and re@@ use photos . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , secure , re@@ group@@ ing , optimize , review , review , and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digit@@ ale inventory takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , secur@@ es , transforms , transformed , ready @-@ assembled and exports content that is a mon@@ ary or cultural value . &quot;
met@@ adata is defined as data about data . met@@ adata is available according to your definition data that provide information on or a documentation of other data that may be managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your machine , then you don &apos;t even need to see how many photos you have , then use not sure &amp; checking ; . the approach to store met@@ adata both in a database and in the image files guarantees very fast search and secure archiving to access you with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
the first thing you do and need to know before you need anything in your system to setup information structure in contrast to the data structure . you need to decide whether other access to your photos will be able to store it on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . note that you will have to switch to a larger drive sometime .
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found via your location . if you have enough photos , then you will print the sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . then export a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as publishing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant access of pictures on different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will then do not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the pile processing simpler . separate new files from old files .
the separation from original and work@@ files simplified a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture .
&quot; we also recommend the option met@@ adata to be used in the setup site of met@@ adata in &amp; checking ; it is certain that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can check the met@@ adata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding point in the menu album . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what is going to change ? do you have a met@@ adata editor available for a number of selected attributes . of course , these are the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now begin the actual work , as you should now select any photo words , lab@@ eling and evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute , and then set the value . this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s go with keywords , keywords , as frequently as you are frequently asked with other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; when you import kat@@ alo@@ ised images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; checking ; automatically the tree for you to build b@@ z@@ w the pictures to the right place . the changed keywords will be done by &amp; checking ; updated while the under@@ scores are per@@ secuted . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different met@@ adata is over@@ cut . this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ adata in truth consists of many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all pictures . &quot;
&quot; enough the keywords - the next section refers to let@@ tering or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alo@@ ise your met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; you just want to see most anyone your photos just let them share with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from a distance not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then catch some details to see people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you this is the landing stage of the Al@@ lies ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing is present . wow ! you start to dream , associations , the historical time period is again present , you might even hear the silence . so the marking has completely changed your perception of this panoramic view . &quot;
&quot; for others who look at your photos the title may be more important than the picture itself . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer it to the viewer , to help Him to understand what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is fine if an image is not perfect , if it has the strength to work alone with a let@@ tering for itself . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; checking , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . K@@ DE gives you even a spelling check . if you have to export your images in Web @-@ galleries . you will have to tell you the story for opening times a second time . &quot;
&quot; remember the times of GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet from Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of spatial presentation is now already with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities to exploit the ge@@ olo@@ k@@ alisation are already un@@ coun@@ table and will be even deeper into the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can open up your travels using geographic data . you can also export the photos along with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc . with the gle@@ maps . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and refers to the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply to all changed versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information came in the furniture page of &amp; checking ; as information is stored :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creators and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person that has created the photo , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then it should not be changed anymore . this field does not support comm@@ mas nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; title ( syn@@ onym for editor @-@ bar ) : linked to the author . this field contains the working name of the photographer . examples for this may be the title of the photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or Independent photographer . since this is a note on the author &apos;s field , this must be filled as well . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : use the provider to identify who is the photo . this does not necessarily be the author . if the photographer is listed for a news agency like Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group / agency will offer the image here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this is no protection against abuse . anyone who has no more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ators , delete or change the solution for this problem are digital water@@ mark . for individuals this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important against it . &quot;
&quot; the digital water@@ mark is unique for each picture . &amp; checking , will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future . &quot;
&quot; topics : record failure , plate failure , power impulses , EC@@ C , transmission defect , aging , des@@ ast@@ ine prevention , age @-@ time , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course , we are not talking about CDs that are lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can also happen to you in traditional paper photos or negative . in this section you are talking about problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data re@@ viewing company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs and you must not be treated longer than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archiving . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; Dollar ; 2 the piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe this is in your measurable room . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disco@@ s and good recording devices and you can use them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more reliable than the cheapest , but you write a lot of reliable . so it is about choosing the right one . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to mistakes , even if you just have been written . therefore , they use a control mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for the form@@ atting and the controls . despite this massive protection they need for the form@@ atting , ultra @-@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which seems to run wonders on CDs and DVDs . it works under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged dis@@ ks , hard disk , flas@@ h@@ media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the For@@ mat@@ ing war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB and thus nearly six sm@@ al the capacity of a dual @-@ layout DVD with 8,@@ 5 GB . of course , everything was said to CDs and DVDs also applies to Blu @-@ ray disk . &quot;
&quot; afterwards burn your data to a clean @-@ quality media in a non @-@ quality media . read afterwards the data with a description , date &amp; author marks and then on a clean , dark dry and on animals protected site . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media . &quot;
&quot; Disk@@ manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturing guarantee includes a new disk , but not the data . Google places a large field study about the error mechanisms of hard disk at your disposal : dis@@ error study &quot;
&quot; shortly : dis@@ ks keep on the longest when you operate in the temper@@ ament area of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C . some of the SM@@ ART error messages are the most common error cause , SM@@ ART does not determine the immediate after@@ math . these are particular read@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and publishing teeth . the expected lifetime of age amounts to between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a black@@ out before you have secured the files , but these losses normally leave without any major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices are not much clas@@ hes , it looks at devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause severe damage to your computer . thus , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause heavy loss , hardware design , destruc@@ tible mother@@ boards and other defects . thus , protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against rap@@ ids is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is absorbed in a part of the energy @-@ heat , and it is usually available in the form of a pin , but remember that not every plug @-@ list also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to protecting the protection against ligh@@ tening and therefore protects the properly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ voltage of each cable can use to your computer , you should be careful that also all the peripher@@ als are connected to your system . some manufacturers represent over@@ voltage protective devices which also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axi@@ al cable of cable and TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have an notebook , you will need a portable excess protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . thus , you are ideal for travel . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection your system protects your system against smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a case of a few seconds can result in the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . therefore , it can be useful to invest in a lower power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection against over@@ rides , these devices can automatically make cordless energy available when a black@@ out occurs . some models allow them to even further work until the stream exp@@ ires . if you buy a US@@ V then you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements like an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the underlying software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; if you have concerns the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and , and compare your safety at the cost of avoiding these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 20 % , A 500@@ W US@@ V can keep you aware of how well your machine is protected . at the end , you should always remember all the cable before you go into the holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web Service contains S@@ 3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service . with the correct configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as secure destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amounts of data . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to hard drives , however , you are very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; Dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; Dollar ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data via the compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . for this it is too slow . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the Photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services available on photos . your free memory is available on 1 GB and you will not have your pictures available in full resolution online . for 25 $ per year you get unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the Web @-@ solutions are very secure . transmission defects are automatically agreed due to the TCP protocol and the large companies are stored in the offer a backup and a wasted memory . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ safely . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transmis@@ sions are suscep@@ tible to transmission defects . the fil@@ esystem and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integr@@ ity between operating system and disk .
the worst thing is that no one says when a transmission error occurred to you . all these disorders remain un@@ detected until you have no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought it to your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
&quot; un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transmission losses , as they create interference within the data flows . with normal fil@@ es@@ ystems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are currently not particularly affected by transfer issues , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with record errors on lower level and is available under one to the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ al fil@@ esystem . it is still in the Alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms that is used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the notebook and 46 % in job systems . in Not@@ ebooks the proportion of the theft is 50 % .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the most primitive . it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under Linux ; no longer has been sighted for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less prone to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal even than ext@@ 3 , rout@@ ing , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the wi@@ dened file systems . a very good English article can be found here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided . if a file has not been completely saved before the problem came up , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of loss of data . &quot;
&quot; digital cameras are removed 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . meant that the technology is further developed , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit . &quot;
today cameras go towards the 10 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this dissolution is already too high for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your border with 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not use anyone else for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by a data loss . so secure your data often according to a plan and test this backup before you make any more dangerous , such as the re@@ installation of your operating system , exchange of plates or the size change of hard disk drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you are doing your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes , you will be lucky if the drive is not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster proposes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft un@@ gl@@ ücke : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they usually affect a whole room or house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ un@@ ks always means a non local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs into the neighboring house , in your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of the physical separation : as it is said above is a common reason for a loss of loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save it one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files are to be secured . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at one time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . it creates several moments . you can restore the original status at any time to which such a backup was made . this backup comes back to a version@@ ing system the next one with the exception that it is only sealed and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transmission tran@@ ts copies only the difference of files that really have been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase safety via ssh .
secure images directly after you have stored them on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium .
&quot; this approach gives you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come up for securing but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least a month and a snapshot of each month . each additional di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ adata , stored in the image file saved IP@@ TC files , Original X@@ MP files , Original , storage , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ ent images and met@@ adata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; thus valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years , that is about the time period in which you really are interested in your childhood and youth , there are two strategies which should be he@@ eded : &quot;
&quot; as the future due to your nature is un@@ predictable , all of what is said today is passed with caution and re @-@ evaluate each 5 @-@ 8 years . unfortunately , there is no other way as a certain vigil@@ ance ; the less variations you have used in the past , the easier it is to assess the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by statements in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is nowadays available for everyone . so if you have an old system important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your machine architecture , your memory and safety technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay in open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s go from that you have planned the scal@@ ability and you want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . with * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ t if your new record was detected from the system , but do not hang it . &quot;
&quot; $ / dev / s@@ d@@ b # Source / dev / s@@ d@@ b # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ b , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; Dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; Dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; Dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of re@@ porter if necessary &quot;
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day does not exist any software you can read it . this task will be easier from year to year .
G@@ IF is a proprietary format that slowly disappears from the market . you should therefore no longer use it anymore .
&quot; P@@ NG was designed as an open source standard to replace the G@@ IF . however , it can be a lot more . it is low @-@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit data , but not as many as TI@@ FF , but not as many as TI@@ FF . this format we would like to recommend you to save your pictures . &quot;
&quot; TI@@ FF was widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ zi@@ pped form or in a container with a loss of free compres@@ sion@@ holes ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . however , there are more than 50 different types available . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
DN@@ G The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licence @-@ free and open blank format that developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G has been develop@@ ped on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is committed to the use of met@@ adata : DN@@ G is already available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon sometime soon .
&quot; this may possibly be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . file information is stored with extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , to archi@@ ved . X@@ MP fits separately as it saves the met@@ adata separately from the image file . therefore , you should consider any problems with the link between the met@@ adata and the image file . therefore , you should think about whether you use DN@@ G as a container and put it all together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organisation that supports self @-@ compatible online metals and business models . among the activities of D@@ C@@ MI , the work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to reach an extensive acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the reader or the scanner . so long the pictures on the cam@@ er@@ edi@@ um are , you can use this as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save it in your rough archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fine handling , you can use external programs . if you edit the pictures again with &amp; checking ; then you should add the met@@ adata again . these were cut down by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; use the processed pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it into web@@ galleries , enco@@ ding in MPEG , use in contact leaves , print &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; checking ; to add . in the section add a photo to an album you will find a description , how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive , but the camera interface offers you many advanced settings to import images to your Al@@ ben@@ database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; checking , connect them to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . on some cameras it may take a while . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for file content , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera are displayed . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the page features and met@@ adata from the camera interface you can see the properties of one entry or its met@@ adata . &quot;
this dialog displays file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras not all information is available .
&quot; the rider Met@@ adata shows the internal met@@ adata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer notices , GPS etc. of the picture . this information is the same as with the met@@ adata side@@ bar , from the main window of &amp; checking ; or the picture editing . note that these met@@ adata at some digital cameras are not available . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your machine is the click on the button download and then download the choice of all . this loads all photos from their camera in a single album in &amp; checking ; . when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were downloaded safely into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired using the standard op@@ tionally available from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the button Download and then download password . the button chosen is long as long as you selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option is download@@ able . these pictures have not yet been released by &amp; checking ; in this case , the new pictures have been downloaded with a star in advance display . if you choose this option , you will only download the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; when you download the buttons All download or download selected , a dialogue with which you can select the target album , shown in which the photos will be displayed . select the list of existing albums you can read in paragraph My albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after downloading the target album , you press OK , and &amp; checking ; invites the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete it from the camera by clicking the button Dele@@ te Show more . if you only want to delete some , then you must select it first and delete the selected item . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no possibility to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera , so you should not check if the photos are successfully deleted in a &amp; review ; so you should be checked carefully before you delete them from the camera , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras use as a fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos often not particularly expres@@ sive names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually deleted again after the pictures were deleted from the camera . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ames . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for rotating and mir@@ rors of the image and for dat@@ ums@@ y sub@@ mit@@ es . if you use this last option , automatically a folder per day is created . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transmission opens three other options that are carried out before the pictures are stored on the record . the first two concern the data on the author Standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the EX@@ IF information is copied into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; if you want another medium format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d : % S : % S . switch the option date &amp; time . for more adjustments you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the camera file name , you have the option when downloading the fil@@ en@@ ames in small case letters . or if you prefer this , if you prefer . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; checking came ; for a photo , is displayed below the name , which displays the camera in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame are stored and automatically used when you open the next time the camera window . &quot;
&quot; and checking ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to the time @-@ point of recording , in order to perform an automatic rotation during shut@@ ters . not all cameras put this information ready . in the section side@@ bar met@@ adata , you can read more details about the information that your camera is embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , release &amp; checking ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to switch the automatic rotation , use the automatic rotation in the bottom area of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera is information about the date when the photo was made , available &amp; checking ; this will be used to download the same sub@@ album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . you can check out all the cameras . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ a , you can check out what information your camera could have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in this case , it saves &amp; checking ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you need to turn this option . use the icon @-@ based under@@ pin at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos from their machine on their camera is to download . then , select up@@ loading . the file @-@ file dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files that are up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods . &quot;
&quot; after the selection is done , asks &amp; checking came ; you where the images are to be up@@ loaded . a folder dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to upload the upload . the pictures will not be deleted from your machine . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this is a position that can be specified in long@@ itude and latitude , which can be displayed on a map . identification of the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers can link it interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to car@@ p an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo has been made , you can easily locate a browser which indicates the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; checking ; user who want to locate the location of the photos , it is well to record the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and card reference . the question is actually more like the data in these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , via a post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to the geographical assignment ( manual ) and finally on the manual input of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated with a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receiver . either as a card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;

downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ p@@ s@@ ba@@ bel . you have to save this data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the module to the geographical assignment .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract data from images and from GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ p@@ s@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ p@@ s@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pre@@ di@@ ous coordinates that may be created for example by m@@ ap@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; m@@ ap@@ s.@@ google@@ .com shows no European road cards . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; &amp; checking came , trying to give you so much control over its working procedures as possible . there are many settings that can be seen in the Settings menu ; select the Settings dialog . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left . &quot;
&quot; select action can be set on embedded preview , or re @-@ editing . so you place the standard behavior of &amp; checking ; determine if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardization and copyright data . these data are automatically selected in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , if the option is selected when downloading from the camera body . also with a database synchron@@ ization these data are written in the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; title is a syn@@ onym for editor . this field should be the professional photographer of the photographer . this can be the desig@@ nations as an employee , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description of the author , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for suppliers : use this field to enter the photo . this does not have to be the author , if this image is used for a news agency like Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , then the group or agency should be made available here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC cli@@ ent@@ s. it is achieved that the met@@ adata is permanently included in the picture and are not only available in the database of &amp; checking ; these met@@ adata are also available to other programs and can be imported ; imported without lost .
&quot; image lab@@ eling as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JP@@ EG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you may add to your photos , containing the images embedded in the images . this allows you to contain your lab@@ eling also by other image notes , these are already written by the digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; the site settings contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse cursor in the main window above a file rests . depending on the chosen option , this information will be displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ tization came ; supports a number of different image formats , and some video and audio formats . to determine which file types and checking ; indicate , you can add the file exten@@ tions to this list and remove it . file folder that does not have any of these extensions , ignored by &amp; checking ; ignored . &quot;
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Re@@ fresh right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the lighthouse &apos;s lighthouse can be set on this page . however , if you then open the light table . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode are then not available . if you have one , then you can get this better results . &quot;
&quot; by default , the image processing provides a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can switch the tool@@ bar , if you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image may be marked with darker or bri@@ ghter color in the picture . these colors will be specified here . in picture editing , this view mode can be set with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and be switched off . &quot;
&quot; with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are co@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in colour information , please read this article in Wikipedia about the near@@ er explanation . &quot;
&quot; with the setting P@@ NG compres@@ sing you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this surgery does not reduce the quality of P@@ NG as P@@ NG requires a loss of free algorithm . if you have a quick calcul@@ ator , you can put this value onto a high compression . thereby , 1 : a low and 9 a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the option TI@@ FF @-@ files , you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ate com@@ pres@@ sion@@ l@@ code for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality since the De@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is free . &quot;
&quot; if you choose loss of loss of JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files , you can save losses . even if you &apos;ve been using the loss of loss , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JP@@ EG . when this paragraph has not been written , met@@ adata was not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; checking , the image processing was only a picture @-@ bearing for photos . at present , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulation of your photos . this dialog allows you to change the settings of the picture editing . &quot;
&quot; the default weight is that all green pixels are identical . if you use this option , solve this problem with minimal loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with minimal loss of details . this option paints the picture a little soft , elimin@@ ates but the 2x@@ 2 G@@ ey@@ moon pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; when this option is set , the white @-@ off of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is set . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the whit@@ eboard is not set . standard , it is a solid colour balance that was photographed on a white map which was photographed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SL@@ R cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps more details in the top . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
&quot; the standard is it the shre@@ w , so the parts of your images are burned @-@ in , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to catch the shre@@ ws . finally , use the setting @-@ depth in the settings . finally , you can try some parts of missing information from the shre@@ ws to re@@ construct . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as quick as green and red . &amp; checking came ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore attempt to re@@ construct the missing green and red @-@ shares from the not saturated blue pixel . of course , this is a question , how much colour or wh@@ ites you want . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to re@@ construct the option , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be individually adapted to each picture . &quot;
&quot; put the li@@ umin@@ escent according to your taste . you probably have to put it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be taken later in the image options of the &amp; review ; picture editing can be too small in order to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should advance conservative . &quot;
&quot; a demo@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a full picture from the particle data sensor , which provides many cameras and which is a matrix @-@ coloured pixel available . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or farms . &quot;
&quot; &amp; checking came ; and D@@ cra@@ w put you three alternatives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ cra@@ w . it produces colour inter@@ pol@@ ation at the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting , if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the colo@@ uring of your l@@ enti@@ ls you can know the red and blue correc@@ tions here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as you are performed during the raw conver@@ ting . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; checking ; information such as the color formations of a colour foam in the others are able to translate the colors as accurately as possible .

settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profile to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your images colored not the entire screen .
&quot; input profiles should be made to the cam@@ ents and model that you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not have coloring mapping or gam@@ ma@@ qu@@ eting . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma does not have to perform for con@@ versions at 16 bit depth . this means you have to perform the color mapping . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of Profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your image has a smaller color range as your camera and some colors therefore very saturated . this could you manually correct , rather than rely on the flas@@ hing algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it is pretty obvious that color profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that match . this answer is of course in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension makes the style for the goal : F for an accurate style , L for Sc@@ ale , N for Neutr@@ al , P for portrait and S for standard style . &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin Interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ esh ; ima@@ gery and image processing . many modules support which have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; if your distribution has installed K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the files you want to use , and they will then be released from &amp; checking ; and these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ command for tasks , which are performed by modules can be set in the menu under settings short @-@ command . &quot;
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the di@@ az@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper regul@@ ator j@@ us@@ ys the time between the pictures , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other att@@ achments turn off the met@@ adata and the met@@ adata on the lower end of the images can be displayed in the display . &quot;
&quot; camera properties show on the left side a list of all the cameras supported on the right . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is connected correctly and in the image mode . currently , the serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage is supported . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active if you have selected a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from cam@@ alis@@ te . you have to specify the path , / m@@ apped / camera or / or , to specify on which you attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; checking ; to use , you have to connect the camera with your computer to switch it into the display mode and turn off . &quot;
&quot; try out whether &amp; checking came ; the camera automatically recognises . if not , you can set camera o@@ od@@ ell and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera appears in the menu camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all here . &quot;
&quot; with the option pol@@ ating dialog for reloc@@ ating &gt; pictures in the tr@@ ash@@ can display , you can set the conversation of &amp; checking ; to delete a photo in an album . in the sections del@@ eting a photo and delete an album you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; editorial changes through the right side bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; checking , if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any query . otherwise , you will need to apply changes with the button modifications . &quot;
&quot; you can also download the welcome of the welcome screen from &amp; checking , while star@@ ing . this acceler@@ ates the launch process from &amp; checking . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking to search new photos and search for new photos , the base folders has been deleted after new or deleted albums / photos . if something is deleted from the base folder , ask &amp; checking ; you , whether it should delete it from the database . &quot;
different colour schem@@ as can be used in &amp; checking ; used to adjust the main window to your tastes . this settings can be selected under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs are applied down below :

&quot; &amp; checking ; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correc@@ ting and improve . image processing can be started by one click with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of preview display / Edit . &quot;
image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; checking ; so you may not be part of your distribution . you can find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the picture editing .
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current data number , magnific@@ ation factor and the current picture size indicates . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar at the top edge , including the tool@@ bar to quick access to the most common functions . &quot;
&quot; the processing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you save file Save or save the button store from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the picture . &quot;
so you should install a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with file save as well .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can use the original image again by using the menu re @-@ establish or the button re@@ manufacture of image processing in tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change that you have done at the photo since the last store . &quot;
virtually any action of the picture editing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action you can und@@ ress by making editing and re@@ inst@@ ated by choosing editing from the menu .
&quot; if you often use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for the cat@@ chy and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; over the back@@ path or re @-@ establish button in tool@@ bar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions are also revers@@ ed and restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the editing process , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navig@@ ational options in the tool@@ bar , picture high , image down or the entries in the menu file . if you have made changes in the current photo , you will be asked if you want to store it . &quot;
&quot; you can get in the photo and out zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel , or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the menu menu . &quot;
&quot; to adjust a photo to the size size , you can use this button in tool@@ bar : enlar@@ ging factor automatically . &quot;
&quot; view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you will come to the normal view , where you can &apos;t use the tool@@ bar . if you do not want this , you can call it in the Settings dialog of &amp; checking ; you can call it from the press release ; view the section to address the picture editing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current picture , you can print a picture in the menu file and get the standard &amp; paste ; press dialog . you can adjust here the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print individual images or whole sentences . all of the images can be printed out of your selection . you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album , if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the review came ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and promotions available for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available , even available in picture editing . it is displayed when one of the five rider is clicked on : &quot;
multi@@ f@@ aches Click on the same rider makes the side@@ bar appear or disappear again in the edge .
&quot; in this description , you can type resolutions with unlimited size or insert . please note the note below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the description will be copied into the EX@@ IF@@ T and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
the IP@@ TC data only support AS@@ C@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut down after 2000 signs and special characters are re@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC application field in other applications you should consider these restrictions .
&quot; after having commented on it , you either use the button below , or simply switch to the next image , which are then saved . &quot;
&quot; next to the apply @-@ button there is a button More . with this you can read further met@@ adata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the met@@ adata into the files . however , this is always done when you choose a met@@ adata that is always written in the pictures . &quot;
the section review shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in Search and Sor@@ ti@@ fications . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut . to select multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . enco@@ ding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keywords displays a search box to filtering the keywords , the keywords , and a selection box with the preceding words in this &amp; review ; -@@ session announced . &quot;
the key@@ word is dynam@@ ically adapted to the search word . you can limit the number of possibilities in finding a key@@ word quickly . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the bottom field at the bottom is another relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have entered various keywords , these are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by mark@@ ers of the corresponding bond fields in the tree . all tags of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field Key@@ word .
&quot; if several pictures are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want to select a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter section . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar sampling filters are used to modify the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , key@@ note and view@@ finder . if additionally one or more key@@ word filters are used from the right side , only the cut@@ ters of these two are displayed . all inherited keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also draw on tags and disc@@ ard it . suppose you have selected several pictures in the main window , you can easily draw it from the right side@@ bar and put on the selection . then a dialog , which asks you whether you want to put the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on one cal@@ ender date . the key@@ word filter is based on No keywords , which is selected the quantity of three images . they were selected with Str@@ g + a , and after that a key@@ word was taken from the right @-@ point of key@@ word on the selection and then moved there . a dialogue asks if this key@@ word is supposed to be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched from settings to settings .
&quot; if you have a rule created and created and determine that it should be one or its own , you can easily change this with a double @-@ click on the text and control . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry to which is sought in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , keywords , etc . &quot;
&quot; 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can choose from all the elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you just need the junction box at the end of the rule and then hit the button group . the options are then as follows : &quot;

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I did it mainly on &amp; checking ; s concrete implementation adapted .
&quot; the reason you work in colour @-@ managed work@@ flow is that the colors used by your camera or scanner come a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photographed or sc@@ anned colours . with a color @-@ managed work@@ flow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are equal to those from your camera or scanner , and that the colors that you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the theme comes on color management , everybody wants to know which buttons , he must press information for the results that he wants . unfortunately , the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information on color management . additionally , you will find links with deeper information allowing you to make your own informal decisions to allow you to get the desired results . &quot;
&quot; if your image work@@ flow meets all the criteria listed below , you do not need to worry about color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB farms . ( further information can be found below )
their only other image spending are via e @-@ mail or the Web where s@@ R@@ GB of de @-@ facto standard is .
&quot; so when s@@ R@@ GB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should one use another color foam and thus have to worry about colour @-@ administr@@ ations ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors we can really see below is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ sty region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB farms , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger farms , please visit Bruce Lin@@ d@@ blo@@ oms and then click on Info and then on Information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I need to calibr@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work for it only in the s@@ R@@ GB farms ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in the s@@ R@@ GB colour or not , you need to use your monitor k@@ Al@@ bri@@ er , since s@@ R@@ GB includes the circle . if you are working as in the colour foam of s@@ R@@ GB , you must either use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , using suitable monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool presents five automatic correc@@ tions available , which can improve an image in most cases . therefore , use it before you try a further manual treatment . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize the same , automatic , automatic and contrast to the menu Cor@@ rec@@ alling Autom@@ atic correction automatically try out of your colors to make the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which the best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alise this method scale the leu@@ static values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ gh@@ test point is as bright as possible without its color sh@@ aded . this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed .
&quot; same : this method involves the lumin@@ osity factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the h@@ isto@@ gram of the intention is as flat as possible . this makes the equivalent very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces trash . it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles at a picture or it destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic wire : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in red , green and blue @-@ channel . it determines the dark and light threshold , and j@@ us@@ ks the red , green and blue @-@ channels on the complete h@@ isto@@ gram@@ mes . &quot;
contrast extend : this method improves the contrast and the ligh@@ tening of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the widest possible area and a new ji@@ usti@@ fication of all values in between . this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white @-@ off from &amp; checking came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white @-@ off of a photo .
&quot; the white @-@ off correction is somewhat limited because of a colour foam with 8 @-@ bit per paint . if you are able to perform far from the original picture , areas with over@@ exposure can occur , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your ways to correct better fall . &quot;
&quot; this tool is based on a white @-@ like c@@ anny , protected by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . you start it on the menu entry colors white @-@ like of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the preview can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original image and preview of the target image . the preview will be dynamic to see the settings of the tool . if you want to see again the original whit@@ ef@@ its , then it is enough to click on the sub @-@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the Pix@@ el under this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in the h@@ isto@@ gram .
&quot; right above will see a h@@ isto@@ gram displayed that dynam@@ ically as soon as you have a parameter . this h@@ isto@@ gram is very helpful , even in well illuminated images , most pixel is very small lam@@ umin@@ ant . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , sati@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shade will lets you improve the shadow details of your photos , or also down . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color @-@ temperature p@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture show around which you use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . this type also allows the temperature and green values automatically . &quot;
additionally you can set the whit@@ eboard with the list of preferences . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than a color channel of the pix@@ el@@ is over@@ exposed .. They will display the combined result in the white @-@ screen . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and does not have any effect on the final picture .
the buttons Save as and store exactly this . each setting of the white bla@@ zing you have set you can save it in a text file and later load them later .
&quot; the button pres@@ ets sets all fil@@ ter@@ ments back to its standard values and the associated neutral white comparison . note that , in addition , neutral settings may result in a different photo as your original . if you save it , your original image will change . &quot;
&quot; you can set up the code volume per color channel of the be@@ worked image . 8 @-@ bit co@@ ding is the widely used JP@@ EG format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ ding is better for high @-@ quality images . this co@@ ding is also needed for high @-@ quality images , but also stands for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and DN@@ G . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog such as the processing of raw images . it uses modification and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be carried out through the sub@@ window for the hel@@ mets . a detailed instruction for the use of color profiles can be described in chapter Color management .
&quot; another important tool can be found in the menu under colors Ton@@ worth@@ iness . this tool makes an integrated way to store multiple color channels at the same time and allows you to always use the same correction , so you will always need the same correction . in the manual for sound correction , you will find further information . &quot;
a very powerful possibility to fix exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under color gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the version came ; tool colo@@ uring effects will provide you with four color effects , a solar system effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a channel filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ ans , was also called Sab@@ ati@@ ans , an effect of the original light . this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illum@@ ination . the result was a partial neg@@ ativity of the image . this tool allows you to j@@ us@@ ze this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar power . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . an additional increase is ultimately a negative image that is not created on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . &quot;
this is an example of solar energy efficiency . the original image is ( 1 ) and this works ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation thus making the colors brilliant and glo@@ wing . try it easy to em@@ bell@@ ish many photos .
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name produced for one on day@@ light revers@@ ed color film that is produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and therefore a reference for his smooth image structure . Vel@@ o@@ as strongly saturated colors are also a few photographers , especially those who barely ab@@ uses landscapes . &quot;
&quot; the ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrac@@ tion . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result , and the shooting repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ lich@@ é . in large images the filter can rel@@ ieve the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon for you to re@@ viewing the different color aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustment can be content in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can make a photo with bad light conditions you can get the opposite problem : one too big sati@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation will reduce it . all changes you can perform in preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lamp @-@ strength / contrast / g@@ amma is the tool tone la@@ sty for improvement of exposure . even if the dialog to this tool very complicated , you need only the area of the sli@@ der . concrete the three sli@@ der below the h@@ isto@@ gram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of Inten@@ sity , an H@@ isto@@ gram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph there are three le@@ vers in which can be clicked , and which can be postponed to change the intensity values of the picture . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the regul@@ ator and look at it how the picture changes .
&quot; on the right side , the original and preview of the picture can be seen . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated , based on the settings of the picture . on the left @-@ hand side , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted if the h@@ isto@@ gram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for pictures of a digital camera , linear h@@ isto@@ gram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is useful . &quot;
&quot; three regul@@ ators : the top for the dark sounds , the mean for the bright sounds and the lowest for the medium tones , often called gam@@ es@@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ os can be used in the preview of the original image to j@@ us@@ ate the shade of shadows , middle and bright sounds automatically . moreover , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators which can be used in order to modify the exit inter@@ actively as with the input data . for example , the compression of the exit can be used as a background while creating something else in the foreground . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the Inten@@ sity of the image . &quot;
&quot; save and store : with these buttons , the listed values can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and re @-@ loaded , and later the Gimp is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ als , the input will automatically be re@@ activated for all shadows , means and solar scene . activate the paint pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image for red , green , blue and the li@@ umin@@ ant channels . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indi@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to view over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that is , you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect to see the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see an example of the alignment of the input service applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha canal , as well as the out@@ lays are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the original is displayed and the target image is displayed dynam@@ ically based on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modifications channel : this list box allows the channel to specify which is changed by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , two symbols are to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures that have been recorded with a digital camera . for pictures with large areas of constant color , the linear mode generates a wide beams . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode continues . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want to move a short panel to the right , for example the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds are corresponding with dark cab@@ s and that the associated image pixels are darker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red mark@@ er to see . if you want to change this mark@@ er on the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is to your taste . &quot;
&quot; save and store : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . each turn you have created can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and later be loaded . the file format is the Gimp cur@@ vy format . &quot;
&quot; if you use this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ als buttons make automatically the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and solar scene . activate the paint pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the check@@ points for the red , green , blue and li@@ umin@@ ant curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indi@@ k@@ ator controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixel . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixel , you get the effect shown only in the preview and it is not an effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ white picture which was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kanal . shadow and solar scene was set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; checking came ; image processing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel bl@@ ender is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of the image processing .
with the can@@ al@@ op@@ aus@@ box you can select the color for the h@@ isto@@ gram : this gives you a first hint about how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the original area of the window displays you a preview . the original can be viewed in comparison to their own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . when you position this in the picture a vertical line in the h@@ isto@@ gram appears to show you the respective color value .
&quot; controls for the module are right down : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels as the channel bl@@ ender then activate the option Mon@@ och@@ rom as the channel bl@@ ender then DAS tools for creating great black @-@ white conver@@ ti@@ fications of your photos . try the green channel for black @-@ white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially if you mix Mon@@ och@@ rom , the reduction of a paint is visible to a visible noise , which occurs from the colour@@ ants . far@@ es consists of small rob@@ bers that occur in each channel differently . if that is the case , you can improve your mono@@ chrome conversion in which you can reduce the colo@@ uring first . &quot;
the store as well as store buttons are used exactly for this purpose . each mix@@ er attitude you can save for later and then load the file format is the Gimp channel bl@@ ender format .
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indi@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to view over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that is , you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel is newly j@@ us@@ hed . the option L@@ umin@@ anz is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed picture under ( 2 ) .
black / white photography always has been intrigu@@ ing intrigu@@ ing because of your abstraction . with the development of digital photography is black / white a working stage because color pictures can be converted easily on the machine . also with a set of movie profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good at all scene images and fits particularly well with portraits against heaven . thus similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Grün@@ filter .
&quot; orange fil@@ tered : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . thus , similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) oran@@ ges . &quot;
Rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red ruler filter . this creates a dramatic sky@@ light and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar @-@ rays at the time of time . thus similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow Lin@@ sen@@ filter . this is the most natural colour correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
&quot; S@@ ep@@ aton : produces hot bright and medium tones , while he adds a little cold in the shots of a pressure and the re @-@ development in a S@@ epi@@ at@@ scho@@ oner . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; checking , tool texture apply you can apply decorative textures to a picture . &quot;
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a wall , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop type portrait of enlarged points , or how a wall picture on a wall . the menu entry image texture use the image processing can be used for it . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right raises the appearance of the depth and three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the image .
a paper text @-@ loop has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief is set to 200 .
&quot; with the &amp; checking , tool frames can add a decorative frame to add a picture . &quot;
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photos is no easy task . an opportunity to keep your attention is to set the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the cont@@ end eye . under picture frame the module can be started out of picture editing .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you set the desired type type for your image . however , it covers the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounded it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame the ideal for a button @-@ effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value area for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image will be greater than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the printing of images , especially when you cut the tool according to aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can easily insert a form@@ at@@ ted text into a picture of any location . this also goes to several places when you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . use text excerpt , orientation , color from the color room and the character set with its features as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ sighted background . already the picture is ready . &quot;
&quot; each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &apos; OK &apos; . once the picture has been saved , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; checking , tool Sch@@ abl@@ ones , you can apply a template via a picture . &quot;
the menu image template apply in the image processing can be used to put sten@@ cils via a picture .
&quot; for the template , there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format and should have to add with maximum compression ( 9 ) to narro@@ wing the file size of the template , so simply send an e @-@ mail in english to the &amp; review came ; mailing list , arrived @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for first time , you need to put your shot folder with the button base folder in dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the shots . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root file has been set for the sten@@ cil , a component of the folder of the Sch@@ ab@@ lon@@ en@@ ord@@ ner is reflected . the selection of a folder is updated automatically using the thumb@@ nails of the sten@@ cils . &quot;
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the enlar@@ ging factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button magni@@ fies the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; shr@@ inks : this button res@@ ized the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template on the whole picture , you need to make the picture down@@ sized . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
post@@ p@@ one : use this button to post@@ p@@ one the picture below the template . take the picture and set it at the desired position .
&quot; OK , if you want to apply the template on your image . the image will then be automatically adapted to the preview size . &quot;
&amp; Check ; represents three different tools for focal areas . each one of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharp@@ ens is a traditional tool to field edge . it is very fast and simple , but generates , especially in dark fields , gran@@ ular images . &quot;
&quot; Un@@ sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . you can use it , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric tox@@ ins and it makes a really good job . the algorithm has been taken out of Gimp and it is copyri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang . &quot;
Re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three as it really enhances the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has several parameters for adjustment .
photos without focus as well as most digital images need a correction of the edge . this is due to the dig@@ itali@@ zation process colors with minimal differences to a color point . that &apos;s the same phenomenon can be observed if colors are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras normally require more detrimental depth than normal cameras for private users .
&quot; with JP@@ EG @-@ images , a camera is often used to have internal shar@@ ehol@@ ding . images in the raw @-@ format , on the other hand , must always be used during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner can turn a focal filter already during the reading of the image . if you disable it , you get control of your image . &quot;
in some situations you can obtain useful results by sharp@@ ens a photo with the field of edge advertising . this allows you to start using the menu entry .
&quot; however , you should be careful about how the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the edge of edges , but also increases the consuming technique to sharp@@ ens the tool . you can easily reach it on the menu entry . you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques for edge . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : an image is too cr@@ ack@@ able . the solution to draw the picture a little soft , is much easier than it . use the tool for soft@@ ness with the menu entry correlation soft@@ ness and experiment something with settings . the preview of the menu on the right of the Di@@ alo@@ ges shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter bl@@ ur is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview may help to edit the picture . the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values often produce good results and should be tested first . an increase in the radius or the amount will reinforce the effect . if you make the discomfort mask , smokers and the impression of seeds in the vicinity of sharp edges . &quot;
&quot; the radius is like a lot of pixels on each side of a can@@ oe through the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow bigger radi@@ i . therefore , they should best raise images best in their final resolution . &quot;
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the kno@@ cked picture added to the original . thereby the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
&quot; the swelling value is a break from the maximum R@@ GB value and the use difference . this way , a minimum difference can be defined for a edge of filters . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones of shar@@ ps are exemp@@ t and therefore , beauty errors in faces , heavens and water surfaces . &quot;
this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed picture the ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a Corpor@@ a value = 0.@@ 0 . &quot;
the &amp; checking came ; tool Re@@ focused re@@ focuses a picture by improving the edge of the field . it used to use the copyri@@ ghted v@@ ault filter algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ focused quot ; this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses usually better results as un@@ sharp mask . you can start it from the menu by running colors Re@@ focus in the image processing .
&quot; in practice the circular thread operates much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixel , which is far from the original pixel rate . the F@@ IR Vienna in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen thread is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the distant pixel . the causes unwanted results . &quot;
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folded . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images the standard value should set 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very bl@@ ur@@ red but then on vit@@ pons .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module .
&quot; smoking filter : an increase in the filter filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0,@@ 1 only rarely helpful . if the smoking filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a high value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value is to be expanded . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your in@@ sharp@@ ness Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sch is . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you have a value equal to zero , so you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the smoking filter . &quot;
&quot; matches size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the size size can produce good results , especially if you select great values for the circular edge or the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen field . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; saving as well as store buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any additional focus on the parameter you have set will therefore be saved for later , and can be loaded . &quot;
&quot; try all the cuts , color and intensive cor@@ rec@@ tions on the picture before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you otherwise change the picture . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; when you read images and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg ; as JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to the un@@ zi@@ pped image . &quot;
&quot; generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ h@@ ers produces better results than sharp@@ ens . this could be caused by the sharp mas@@ king to use a bigger neighborhood than sharp@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; theoretically , it is necessary to create bl@@ ur meas@@ les ever ar@@ te@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of the shar@@ pen@@ ing filter . in practice , the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the Un@@ sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Vienna Filter is often better for the processing of small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different fil@@ tern , on a small un@@ focused picture : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp color picture has to be corrected . this picture was made with an an@@ alogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto @-@ focus Lin@@ se .
&quot; for more information about the methods of focal design , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
the regul@@ ator G@@ elling is composed of the dis@@ sharp@@ ness of the area which was bl@@ acked out to produce a natural herb .
&quot; the color tin@@ te enables a customized color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes rather than dark , then you can adjust this here . &quot;
the tool error correction is one of the most widely developed tools to remove not desired ar@@ te@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the algorithm algorithm has been developed by IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; this tool contains various pres@@ ets as a starting point , to simplify the restoration . the available settings are listed below : &quot;
in case you want to use the filter settings in a j@@ us@@ b you can use the rider G@@ elling and advanced settings .
detail @-@ keeping p &#91; 0 &#93; 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to an even@@ ly smooth@@ ing over the picture . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be required . please note that the details of detail should always be sub@@ ordinate .
direction addic@@ tive Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es even@@ ly in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . JP@@ EG arti@@ facts are best eliminated with a value in the vicinity of 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 &#93; 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum glasses factor above all . then define the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore put this value appropriate to the degree of smoking in your image .
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : these parameters affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is necessary , as it is difficult to generate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
repeti@@ tions : returns how often the algorithm is passed through . usually it ranges from 1 or 2 out .
&quot; &#91; 5 &#93; 90 &#93; reply : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha is selected , it should also be too small . therefore , you should make sure that small angles will be a long run@@ time . you should therefore choose this value as a maximum possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; inclusive stri@@ de range &#91; 0,@@ 1 , 10 &#93; : inclusive stri@@ de with pixel . you should put the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation uses : the more quality you receive by choosing this option is only low . but it doubles the run@@ time . we recommend it to allow him .
the buttons Save as and shop exactly do this . any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file and re@@ charged later .
image errors are compar@@ atively very fast when working . but nevertheless it can take very long and take a high CPU load after you . therefore you can ab@@ ort the calculation at any time with the button break .
below you can see how bugs can be corrected with small arti@@ facts . the module is applied on a photo that in Guatemala city with an an@@ alog@@ ous camera was applied . as you see there is a peculiar black arti@@ fact that caused by poor film storage during the trip ( 1 ) and the corrected picture under ( 2 ) .
the review came ; spac@@ es@@ reduction is a very powerful tool to l@@ essen tri@@ dr@@ au@@ ts . it uses a copyri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters available to remove stain@@ s and other ar@@ te@@ facts , for example from dust or hair on the lens , and it can also be used to remove sensory recept@@ acles from the camera or fashion jewellery ; -@@ effects of saved images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information on sensory cameras from digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the scre@@ enshot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular smoking that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you need only the sub @-@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings may remain at default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the size size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filters . large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and allows the image to be bl@@ ending through the image and the color in it will be smooth@@ ed and therefore smaller bugs . &quot;
sharp@@ ness : controls the focal point . this value sets the pixel rate . if it is increased to change the filter filter you may need to change the edges filter . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter details does not get more and noise or lubric@@ ate occurs again . &quot;
edges : controls the edge @-@ precision for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong can not occur the entire rob@@ bery or smoking tips can occur . put it at a value close to the maximum when you want to remove a more vigil@@ ant smoking or JP@@ EG @-@ arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the ligh@@ tness of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the glasses process that is controlled by the details .
color : controls the colour @-@ tolerant of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the glasses process that is controlled by the details .
&quot; Gamma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ um@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark areas , which typically become stronger and consuming , however , he also lubric@@ ates the shadows . &quot;
&quot; absorption : controls the adjustment of the phosph@@ ate absorption . this value is defined as fast the adap@@ tive filter radius , when it is increased , the edges may appear too high . if he is on his minimum , smoking and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter may occur at edges . he can remove spac@@ ers and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; storing and loading : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters for smoking reduction , which you have set , can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded . &quot;
this is an example of how smoking reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the smoking reduction was applied with default settings .
&quot; sometimes an image is too cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft , is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool for soft@@ ness with the menu entry correlation soft and experiment with the smooth@@ ing on the right side of the Di@@ alo@@ ges . the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the review came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease phot@@ ar@@ te@@ at .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts of your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove palate &apos; sound material , scrat@@ ching , compres@@ sible , compres@@ sing and local errors that occur in digital , original or detrimental digital images , thereby making the content as it also makes the human eye . &quot;
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture . the text composition is done with another tool that has error error correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ tica and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JP@@ EG arti@@ facts reduce : the compression of JP@@ EG is not perfect in some areas even very far away . as a loss of discomfort &amp; quot ; arti@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are in un@@ compressed picture . this attitude should correct these problems .
the buttons Save as and store exactly this . every adjustment of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and later be loaded again .
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very quick at work . however , it can last very long and take a high CPU load after you . so you can ab@@ ort the calculation at any time with the button Be@@ end . &quot;
below you can reduce how a photo with equ@@ est@@ ly noise will be restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photograph that with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with an sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film bas@@ kets on the faces . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time textures was applied to an old colour photo that has been applied with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts created by the Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lights and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original picture is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture under ( 2 ) .
&quot; the version came ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows Hot@@ pixel of photos with a C@@ CD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by Martin Dick@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; light , dead or hot pixel are particularly high in high @-@ quality raw mode photos , since many cameras with JP@@ EG compression has a built @-@ in repression for hot pixel . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; &quot; quot ; bright pixel &quot; &quot; ; currently , there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel . &quot;
download this file in the wizard with the button dark . the tool will automatically identify the hot and bright pixel . these will be highlighted in the picture .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can record the dark picture right next to discover new hot or bright pixel through C@@ CD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark picture to the correc@@ ting picture . note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and will automatically re@@ charge this automatically in the next meeting . &quot;
the image area and the preview can help you correct the result within the picture . the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are raised in all pre@@ views areas .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixel rate on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
&quot; Dur@@ ation : it will be an average of the neighboring pixels . the resulting color will be assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a gap of 1 from the pix@@ el@@ block to be drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing pixels on the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are put in to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
Cub@@ an : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ Cub@@ an interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that will then be used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , made from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization came ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image . &quot;
&quot; objective lenses , in particular the medium and large photo format , can not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ animal @-@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light to the sensor there . Tele@@ lenses show also this behavior . &quot;
&quot; but it also has disadvantages . many Center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the bl@@ ending filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . breadth objective , even with center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise in@@ sharp@@ ness effects arise through movement . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by contemporary cameras and film @-@ scanner by using a equi@@ valence transformation at a rough image , which is applied without this filter . the algorithm is copyri@@ ghted by John Walker . &quot;
with three speakers you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image .
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light weight absorption at the point of the largest density . the default density is 2,@@ 0 , which compens@@ ate for a optical filter with a aper@@ ture adjustment of 1 , or by chance to compens@@ ate the density of a greater degree of Vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ osity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correc@@ tions reduces the lumin@@ osity of the target image . you need to restart the exposure of the target image with these options . the regul@@ ators provide you with only positive values as you just need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fin@@ er re @-@ adjustment of the exposure of the target image , let the values for illumin@@ ating / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the press release ; image processing out of the Menu Color Gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of Vig@@ net@@ ting correc@@ tions applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the picture of Vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a lamp @-@ stronger and contra@@ correction was also performed in the picture with this tool .
the release came ; Lin@@ sen@@ distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos . it uses a copyri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geom@@ etric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second gra@@ dient covers the general geom@@ etrical distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ v@@ ish form of the picture .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third engra@@ ving has a similar circular effect , fla@@ p but at edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the co@@ efficient fourth gra@@ des corrected the distant corners opposite to the second Gra@@ des . if you combine these two , each geom@@ etrical distor@@ tion can be almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; generally , this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the second gra@@ des . with negative values , ton@@ ed distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values of kis@@ sed distor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the distor@@ tion . this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the center of the picture . for most lenses , the &quot; corners parameter &quot; the reverse marks of the parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value will scale the image size and thus leads to a correction first gra@@ des . negative values enlarge while positive the image smaller .
&quot; bright : this value j@@ us@@ ates the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview is illustrated . the values you use for your image will be saved and used in the next start as standard values . &quot;
&quot; the ton@@ utri@@ d or kis@@ ses correction should be carried out in front of all cuts or size changes . at best , you perform this correction as all the first . if you re@@ ap a picture anew and then one ton@@ ed correction would be apparent the effect is apparent . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the maritime edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the ton@@ - / kis@@ ses distor@@ tion using the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a kis@@ sed distor@@ tion , the resulting picture will have black corners . you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu , cut out of the image processing or via the zoom ship of this dialogue . &quot;
&quot; for most images the ton@@ si@@ shaped correction is made . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs , such as recordings from front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture 90 degrees have . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have an easy distor@@ tion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the t@@ onal correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture under ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infr@@ ared gur@@ u.@@ org web site which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ ared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity area of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below the preview you can simul@@ ate two parameters and simul@@ ating film @-@ sensitivity ( ISO ) . the ISO recept@@ gler changes the quantity of cinem@@ at@@ oning and dominance of colour green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows know how snow !
&quot; because the filter shades are to reproduce by infr@@ ared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to use the effect on black / white photos , since the colour changes are missing . &quot;
this is an example of infr@@ ared fil@@ ly applied to a Land@@ scape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra into the top .
&quot; the check came ; filter film bas@@ kets is an easy to use tool to reproduce film bas@@ kets on your pictures . this is of classic high @-@ speed films like e.g. the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known . to mix the sensitivity of the movies , the manufacturer great silver bas@@ kets of the photo em@@ ul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the cinem@@ atic effect can be found in your photo a certain atmosphere or seems to go back to the past . the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere released from everyday life . in case you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , road@@ photographic sight especially in your mono@@ chro@@ med photos , so you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regul@@ ator , the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ arity of the gra@@ ins can be calibr@@ ated . the standard value is , although often higher values need to be applied to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more gra@@ ins , then you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the cinem@@ atic effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this processed ( 2 ) . the used film hyper@@ sensitivity corresponds to ISO 1600 .
the draft version came ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses the copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the release came ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . natural paintings and styl@@ istic life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the top select the brush @-@ size between one and five out . thicker brus@@ hes are better suited for big pictures . smooth brus@@ hes are suitable for large pictures . smooth brus@@ hes are viewed from the other side , the arti@@ sans . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and working with the ( 2 ) . Pin@@ sel@@ fs for this 640 pixels wide picture is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
the &amp; checking came ; filters coal @-@ drawing uses color and Inten@@ sity gra@@ dient to create a coher@@ ent in the drawing are emphasized . pictures of their gra@@ dients are therefore not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you would like to imagine which scene you would have chosen to sc@@ ure you . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two controller with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the top regul@@ ator select the pin size and the lower j@@ us@@ ks the contrast ( smooth@@ ing ) .
this is an example of the coher@@ ence filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changing image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adapting the Inten@@ sity value .
the release came ; filters engra@@ ving your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was gest@@ ed in wax . it uses a copyri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the release came ; Filter Grav@@ ur is a quick tool to return your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . he works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure , where colour does not use the most important part of the content . the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to transform the image into a gray , sophisticated landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast to the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds 10 % , is the default . &quot;
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distor@@ tion . it uses copyri@@ ghted algorithms of pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; wave @-@ bucks 1 : divide the image into cells and look it , as if it is seen through glass @-@ bucks . &quot;
&quot; wave @-@ bucks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave @-@ blocks 1 , the picture will dist@@ orts here with a different version of glass blocks . &quot;
some effects need long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can break these effects at any time with the button Be@@ end .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of shar@@ per effects . it uses copyri@@ ghted algorithms of pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ped the image along static lines that go from one centre point . this simul@@ ates the shar@@ pen@@ ing a zo@@ oming camera and thus generates a dynamic expression of the often in sports photography .
radi@@ ale Un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ red the picture by turning the pixels to a center . this simul@@ ates the shar@@ pen@@ ing of a revol@@ ving camera .
distance un@@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the picture to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to be back in the background .
&quot; motion @-@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ped the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the shar@@ pen@@ ing of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographed , camera . &quot;
sof@@ tening Un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ red the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ or photos or to add a warm and subtle light . &quot;
loop @-@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ red the image by random shift of pixels and simul@@ ates the im@@ mortality of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent im@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the color basin in the picture and bl@@ ends it without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new . &quot;
some effects need long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore ab@@ ort this calculation at any time with the button Be@@ end .
the shelves are a nice little tool to make reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p on your image . this gives it natural your pictures a wet appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyri@@ ghted algorithm .
trou@@ gh size allows to change the size of the drop . since the trou@@ gh size does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish changes the optical effect of drops in the picture .
&quot; you can keep using the press release ; image processing can hold a area free from reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p . use the tool to choose the area , e.g. a face that is free to stay free . if you then start the filter reg@@ imen , the area will remain free of reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ drops . &quot;
this is an example of the reg@@ istrar . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it by mir@@ rors or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu transform@@ ers and trans@@ former mir@@ rors . &quot;
photo bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is simple . the big question is , how can you keep an image infl@@ ated and the details are sharp ? how can you find the missing information or gu@@ essed ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm which is used here is a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below . &quot;
&quot; the tool to change size uses an linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method , around the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate . &quot;
many image processing programs use some kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; checking ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo bub@@ bles was developed by IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you have to tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below :
&quot; aspect ratio : if this setting is activated , when entering the new size is the aspect ratio of the original image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : these parameters affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is necessary , as it is difficult to generate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ae effect , he must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
the buttons Save as and shop will be exactly used . each entry for photo may enlarge can be saved as a text file and later be loaded again .
&quot; photo bub@@ bles is very fast in what it makes , but it can still take very long and take a high CPU load after you . you can ab@@ ort the calculation at any time with the button Be@@ end . &quot;
you can see below an example of photo bub@@ bles by using a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the larger image ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement to comparison .
&quot; cutting of a photo is not only a frequently run operation , but also a often underestimated tool to put an image . the image processing allows you to just cut a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rect@@ angle , create . you will then see this rect@@ angle , then you will see the mouse over . &quot;
&quot; when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photos would be cut off . this allows you to change the size of the cut area . you can drag the size of the cut area by clicking the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle generate it simply by clicking the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the inc@@ ision , use the kno@@ b button of the image processing in tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file storing or file storing in the menu file to save the newly cro@@ pped photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains to be preserved . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a high @-@ format or cross format . in the high format , the greater value of height and width is assigned to the width . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means it is always the same , regardless of whether you use cen@@ tim@@ etres , ink or any other physical size . you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to center the selection automatically horizontal or ver@@ tically .
&quot; down in dialogue , you can set up with the Max . proportional button to cut the area to access to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen relation and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool to cut off aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation ( Horiz@@ ontal or Ver@@ tik@@ al ) . if you use the fe@@ eder tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation . the changed images are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data will reflect the pointed image and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of the setup relief allow to consult with help to put your images better . these help are :
&quot; harmonious triangle : harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of similarity . like the third el@@ re@@ gel , harmon@@ ic triangles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles at the di@@ agon@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Golden Mid : the golden middle is a division that appears on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us pussy or the leaf@@ lets of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,@@ 6@@ 18@@ 0@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used for the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who built your temple and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acci sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 ,
the Golden Center provides liquid aid lines if you set up a picture . these help are en@@ umer@@ ated below :
&quot; the golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal . compared to third el@@ re@@ gel , the golden spiral creates a liquid line which can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s view along the line of the spiral , and creates an symm@@ etric flow on this type . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the right corner of the golden spiral , also called the golden corner . these rectangular area are used to specify the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . this something can simply be given without the eye , it will fulfil its mission . &quot;
&quot; the triangles also deri@@ ve from the top of the golden spiral . their verti@@ ces are the middle points of the pages of the golden corner . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ triangles , Golden triangles are not a equ@@ ilater@@ al triangles . di@@ agon@@ ale can be placed on these lines can be a static object of dynam@@ ical . &quot;
if you use golden triangles to break your frame generate a effect that is called by professional photographers dynamic symm@@ etry . try to place your image processing at one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t achieve any other way .
the options Horiz@@ ont@@ ally flip and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic divisions .
with the button Color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you can have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the aid lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rot@@ ation is a tool to turn a picture to any corner .
&quot; if you make a photo , then it happens easily that you are not exactly vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture in which things turned around an angle . you can fix this using the &amp; checking ; image processing and tool free rotation , select Free Rot@@ ation and j@@ us@@ ting the destination angle . &quot;
rot@@ ate your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are set in degrees . with the button Pre@@ ferences you can set the sli@@ der again to 0 degrees . a preview of the spin is on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right top .
&quot; for your help , the module is free Rot@@ ation to position a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the picture show around the two lines . once you fix it on an important point of the picture you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now you have described the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
after you have shot an image you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair it is the function transform@@ ers to use the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the function automation cutting . select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing smooth@@ es the picture a bit after the spin . take note of the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tional transformations are carried out by a fixed point of reference to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right of the Di@@ alo@@ ges you will find some information which help you to change the perspective :
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation into pixel . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation into pixel . &quot;
angle on the top : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the top : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
corner left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
corner at the bottom : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; according to the adaptation of the perspective the picture becomes a little wasted . for a single adjustment , this effect is small but two adjustments produce a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after leaving the perspective , you get un@@ joy@@ ous tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to cut it to some is to cut the image with transform@@ ers from the image processing . &quot;
the utility tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite . this is no spin , the image will be distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ elo@@ gram . you can start this module over transform@@ ers . &quot;
sc@@ iss@@ ors your picture by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . you can push horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will appear on the right of the thumb@@ nails .
&quot; to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have carried out the shot , the picture becomes a bit bl@@ ur@@ red . for a single shot this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two shots generated twice as much dis@@ bl@@ ending and hence you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after finishing , the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the image with transform@@ ers from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; checking ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats , and in some cases , from the way these libraries have been comp@@ iling . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; checking . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to specify a list of all file formats available on this site . however , you will always find JP@@ EG and TI@@ FF . &quot;
&quot; &amp; checking came ; shows only files in formats of the file . if the extension is listed in the list , the publication is displayed in the picture editing . you can modify this list of file exten@@ ders that can be published . in the section configuration you can find more information about this . &quot;
virtually all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to select even the use format . a detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; review came ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compres@@ sible methods on digital images . thereby redund@@ ant information is reduced to save this way the tri@@ dd@@ les on a more efficient way .
&quot; JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . in general , there is better , smo@@ other results as JP@@ EG in the same compression rate . the 200@@ 0s can also save losses if this is indicated in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the raw materials format , you can read more about the Roh@@ lo@@ ous press and Cambridge in Col@@ our very helpful tut@@ orials in English . you can convert raw material images in JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF with the rough image of &amp; checking ; convert the configuration you can find more information about the use of modules with &amp; checking . &quot;
&quot; &amp; checking came ; supports the loading of raw materials supported only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is available in &amp; digi@@ tization . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats used by &amp; checking ; supported : &quot;

&quot; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons which you can turn off to show over@@ - and sub@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general setup page .
&quot; ( 3 ) : the frame for the selection of the preview . you can take this frame with the mouse within the picture and take place on the part of the picture , from which you want to preview . the preview of the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately . &quot;
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your standard values . all entries from the last use of the module are noted .
the page tool@@ bar displays essential information about the selected image and is widely explic@@ able . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters at the shoot of the photos . these data originates from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
&quot; this tab presents an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ ature . you can drag it onto a square . you press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to drag a square . all pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , this requires your images to Ge@@ o data . &quot;

&quot; &amp; graphic viewer : is a K@@ DE program for viewing from &amp; Graphi@@ c@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs , the &amp; Graphi@@ cal ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; graphic viewer : project has set itself the goal of replacing these programmes through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphic viewer : is a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; Graphi@@ c@@ z ; dot ; -@@ graphs are free layout programs . &amp; graphic viewer ; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; K@@ ate ; and &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ( such a change of the graph in &amp; K@@ ate ; the graph re@@ comp@@ uted and in &amp; graphic viewer ; )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; K@@ ate ; open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; in a &amp; K@@ ate ; component to open
loading of large graphs ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 k@@ not and one h@@ ack to represent more than those knot@@ s )
&quot; further required software : &amp; k@@ graphic viewer : is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; Graphi@@ cal ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of the graph . requires in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the opened graphs , each in an own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graphic viewer , the main window is empty like in the bottom scre@@ enshot . in this case , tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list may be opened . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like at the bottom of the scre@@ enshot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is larger than the surface area . you can select a fixed location of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special ta@@ sts , left and right with dra@@ fted &amp; old ; key ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; when the file has just been changed into &amp; graphic viewer , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph will be re@@ loaded or if you want to change the change , so your decision will also notice , so you can change your decision later , you can set the menu item settings c@@ itations ; set up ... see also . &quot;
&quot; when you open a graph hand outside a running &amp; graphic viewer ; instance , in the file browser or at the command line , you have the option of whether you want to open a new &amp; graphic viewer , or want to represent the inv@@ itations in an under@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the interior dialog . &quot;
&quot; at the program start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice as well as later . &quot;
&quot; you can also specify how the graph to be split into several pages , the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen . &quot;
&quot; if you use several pages , you can choose if the parts of the graph to be displayed on one side . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled with the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
aspect @-@ show with one on several pages distributed Grap@@ h without head@@ line and with a different font
&quot; the site again allows you to set the behavior if a file has been altered on the hard disk , and eg ; from another program . you can set a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ charging or ignore the changes ) or the program every time . &quot;
&quot; the opening gives the opportunity to specify the behavior of &amp; graphic viewer , when a graph will open outside a current session . you can open a standard behavior for this case ( the graphs in a new window or set up in a sub@@ window of already running session ) or determine that every time is asked . &quot;
&quot; the site administration is the possibility to set the start @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer , set up . you can specify a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine if you start afterwards . &quot;
&quot; the context menu , usually at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; appears , opens further possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose among different &amp; Graphi@@ c@@ z ; Lay@@ out@@ algorithms . the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; Graphi@@ cal ; are :
&quot; dot ; algorithm , the standard for targeted graph . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered depic@@ tions of directed graphs . the algorithm puts edges into the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few channel cuts . &quot;
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for fer@@ mented grap@@ her . he produces representations according to the spr@@ ing@@ as model . thereby the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai @-@ algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statisti@@ cally multi@@ dimension@@ ing sc@@ aling . &quot;
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a boun@@ cing model layout . it uses the frustration model layout . it uses the fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics and includes a multi @-@ level controller for the treatment of large and ge@@ clu@@ stered graphs .
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm orders the k@@ not circular , according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ stri@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of several cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which will then run by a shell . the command should give Graph@@ end@@ at@@ as parameters , and the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in the x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can add &amp; eg ; the &amp; Graphi@@ cs ; -@@ algorithms special options , or also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
determines the type of the graph ( directed or ung@@ eri@@ ed ) and uses the standard algorithms for the respective type ( dot ; for targeted , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for targeted graph ) . &quot;
&quot; if this option is activated , the overview is displayed , if necessary . otherwise , it is not displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
displays the What is the mouse cursor . click with this mouse cursor to a &amp; GUI ; -@@ item to get more help to this item ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available under this address and in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the base folder of the source archive .
&amp; k@@ graphic viewer : is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; Graphi@@ c@@ z ; tools to display . it requires the following programs :

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alisation allows to add and edit GPS coordinates into the met@@ adata of an image and edit the geographical data in the EX@@ IF sampling of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a card in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alisation makes tools available to loc@@ alise images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spherical coordination system , which is used by GPS and Galileo . height , long@@ itu@@ dinal and lati@@ tudes are used thereby . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS trace as XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ For@@ mat@@ . g@@ p@@ s@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can bring a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu on . the top to viewing dialog appears . of course , you need to load a split file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains of course data the same time at the same places , as the images of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the file loads a automatic correlation , the coordinates are recorded in red . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera should be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera zone here . &quot;
&quot; the adjustment for the maximum time devi@@ ation is a top devi@@ ation for the GPS period and cam@@ er@@ eit . is the devi@@ ation below , which is the same . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you do not have any spam data from one place for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the images . the difference in 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have any proper data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ating in a large difference between camera and GPS is , you can put these limits here and then push the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have taken a number of photos at the same place . as the dialog depends on a call to the next , you just have to use the button OK to put the data at the current picture . &quot;
&quot; the loc@@ alization can also be found with the shown map and set and set . select this the relevant region and enlarge it . select this again and again through , until you have achieved a sufficient accuracy . the card can always be manually changed manually . the card can be changed manually between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang out the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the fonts will be UT@@ F @-@ 8 , in order to enable the best possible internation@@ alization . &quot;
the module has four horse@@ men in which the settings can be adjusted . you only need to select all albums that will be exported to HTML . you will not only select a large number of albums on the right . in the area below the alert and the text of the HTML page will appear on the top of the HTML page .
&quot; the tab shows the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely in@@ explic@@ able . if you click on an image , a new page will be displayed in the picture . otherwise , the picture is displayed directly with your default image , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , displayed &quot;
&quot; the rider Album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your related pictures . select a folder on which you have written permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ ER@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures are also stored in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the standard colour base . of course , the file size also influences the file size . all other settings are explained by themselves . &quot;
&quot; the tab thumb@@ nails allows you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for the thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window displays the user to how far the action is . press abor@@ ting to break the process .
&quot; if the module created the pages automatically , the window will not automatically shut down . you can therefore read the program@@ mm@@ ings to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will automatically end up in order to preview the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to lock the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I Bild@@ chter is a very fast and flexible OpenGL application to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I picture is allowed to watch a selection of pictures and perform on them base operations such as screen@@ ings , zo@@ oming or shifting . the viewer can be used with short @-@ missing and mouse clicks . it was developed for quick tri@@ via and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JP@@ EG loss module is a tool to change images without compromising quality .
&quot; this module allows for the actions listed below , to store pictures in the JP@@ EG format without the usual losses in quality or met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is it which is the file size , since no compression of the color formations takes place . this can be found e.g. at the P@@ NG Format . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer &apos;s module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a diet .
&quot; the module MPEG enco@@ ding can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV of the Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the Sli@@ deshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; first , you must first select the images that are to be packed into MPEG di@@ az@@ au . after that , you can create using ex@@ tras MPEG di@@ az@@ au . &quot;
the images selected by you are then en@@ umer@@ ated in the portfolio under image files . there you can also change sor@@ ting of the images or the contents of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , XV@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is set forward and most probably the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds the one image will indicate . the speed of the picture will be specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should let them black . the name and path of the created file can be set up under the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep in mind the same as possible . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under name of the audio source file , then it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your preferences , you can go with the button co@@ ding the production of your computer . depending on the speed of your computer you can now go back quickly or in all serenity , if you are back again . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools is missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages to the right button below . &quot;
the pressure assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard Photo@@ sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp . this is e.g. useful to enhance you or using the Gimp module to print a direct expression .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images to one of three formats JP@@ EG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original section of Him is , do not expect the same results as the software from your comra@@ de . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w . &quot;
&quot; first , select the RA@@ W file that is to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w picture @-@ kon@@ verter window appears then in mode for a single image . with the button Pre@@ view you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now restart the values to optimize the con@@ versions process . the first option decides whether the camera settings can be used for the white @-@ off . the key parameters such as Gamma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be used . if the result is not optimal you can further work the picture later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G Con@@ version can be selected , so you can use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera works in the R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G counter has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . JP@@ EG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; tagged Image Format , TI@@ FF , reserves all the information of your image and uses the loss of free L@@ Z@@ W compres@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; if you are planning to edit and use your pictures later or later you should not use the JP@@ EG format , since it is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality deterior@@ ated . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you select JP@@ EG as a memory format , the met@@ adata contained in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JP@@ EG file in the EX@@ IF data . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start with the exec@@ uting the conversion . if you want to break this process again , you can break down this process . &quot;
&quot; the pile processing mode allows you to convert various images on one time . use this mode when you are sure , for example by testing in a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; however , the available settings are virtually identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the option to automatically over@@ write the existing file . however , this is helpful in case these in a previous attempt has been created . a preview is not available at how far the conversion has advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of an album . you can put the pre@@ fix that should be used to start the star@@ ring and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the record .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can make the image smaller or enlarge . these include four types of imaging change :
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 2 d@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image of the screen format . &quot;
not proportional : not dis@@ proportionate scale changes in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed by this option .
&quot; press preparation : prepares the image for the photo pressure . the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the phot@@ op@@ iers . the target image , including background size , boundary size and background colour , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected images with your favorite email program . it is also possible to change the size of the download@@ able pictures before . you can drag the images to the list of images and store it there . &quot;
&quot; after you have started the module window , the image window will be displayed with the images selected by you . you can add additional images via the button images . for the last selected image a preview is displayed on the right @-@ hand side . &quot;
you can also drag pictures to the picture list and put it there in order to add images to the images below .
with the button images the selected images from the list of images will be removed .
once you have selected all the images you can open with the button OK the new message window of your e @-@ mail clients . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures selected are attached already as app@@ endi@@ x .
don &apos;t forget to ship too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts will have limitations for the size of your e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails when you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for sending pictures . your configuration is stored and used every@@ time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ Mail@@ Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after the choice of comments in an attached file , the comments are attached to the images in a text file and attached the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it &apos;s best adapted to the loss of photo files such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JP@@ EG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JP@@ EG under images file format and are the original files in the JP@@ EG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data are added to sen@@ sed images . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down so you can look at the status registr@@ ations , in search of errors , watch out . your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . with the button Sh@@ let you can shut up this window ? &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions like you want to have your Di@@ asch@@ au . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album here . &quot;
&quot; the option OpenGL options in the presentation are using very elegant image outputs by OpenGL . however , you need to have an appropriate graphics card , since otherwise the diet can be very slow . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ame option shows that the fil@@ en@@ ame is displayed in the lower left corner , during the presentation . &quot;
the option loop makes it possible to display the presentation in an end@@ release loop . you can then manually put them manually with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly select is that the pictures in a random order will be displayed . so it is not used the order of pictures in the album .
&quot; under delay between the images , the time distance can be set between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard . however , the best distance depends on your machine and the selected transition effect . so you should show it before you show your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tions effects between which you can choose . accidentally chooses to choose from any transition between pictures a different effect .
&quot; during the Di@@ ash@@ au , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move your mouse into this corner to turn you off . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the gas@@ kets . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date j@@ us@@ cu@@ le currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under c@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants in this list are speaking English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background picture is a tool to set up a picture as a background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module consists of the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as the background for your K@@ DE work . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; through these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see by comparing with the picture , are now available in each group , so in individuals , places and in group key@@ note entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you see the categories , for which you have entered information as you provided your pictures and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumb@@ nails . in the following each one is described for itself . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person only the pictures show on which both persons are visible . through this selection method , you can limit the number of images shown by a few thousand pictures on a few individual images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view the thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can store with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can store a separate preview , which is of course also for places , keywords and other categories that you define themselves . see this picture . &quot;
&quot; to view pictures beside the name , select the button that you need to use right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can see e.g. symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you do not have appropriate pictures for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you must specify itself which picture is to be displayed for each individual person . to view this , you need to select the image level page ( in closer ) and select the picture format you can adjust to your preferences and thus select which part of the picture is displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you open the entry window to the entry window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for the celebration of image properties . this dialog allows you to look at the picture again . &quot;
&quot; if you want to enter a string or descriptions of the images after this text , you can also enter a date , for example in 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a section of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all pictures according to certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , on which Jes@@ per , however , are not Anne Hel@@ ene depicted . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album . if you do not like to read manuals , but prefer to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and look out the fast entry , the screen@@ shots and the quotes . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; on photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialogue the demo , in case you start &amp; on photo@@ album ; first time , or select in the menu Help menu entry photo@@ album ; -@@ demo . ther@@ eu@@ pon , some example images are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album , you will see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar you see here : . as the name suggests , this void shows you date statistics about the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar shows you another unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
the tim@@ eline you can use in the following ways ( if you select a date will show you the first image of this date in the preview image ) and furthermore the tim@@ eline is always shown the current date at the moment shown in the preview view .
&quot; you can also select a area of the tim@@ eline by clicking the mouse button down and select the mouse over the lin@@ e@@ al of the tim@@ eline , so when you select an area , you will be displayed in the preview display only pictures of this period . you can ab@@ ort the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; on photo@@ album , you can create HTML @-@ websites with your pictures . one is integrated in &amp; photo@@ album ; the one is available in &amp; photo@@ album ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the integrated version is described in &amp; photo@@ album ; integrated version which you can create via the menu HTML ... access &quot;
&quot; before HTML @-@ Pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first enter the title of the item and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on photo@@ album , HTML example pages , you will see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album can be created ; export file should be created on the overview page . nutritional information on export files can be found in . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed . therefore , you can avoid that information is displayed by the viewer . for example , that all pictures are exported from a party . therefore , you can &apos;t use this option to hide specific pictures from certain considerations . &quot;
&quot; in this area you can specify how the HTML pages look like . most settings are clear , so that this is not specifically received . &quot;
&quot; on the page you can set up various resolutions for the pictures . thus , those who have viewing your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images download the example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewers of your site may change the resolution at any time you have specified . so , it &apos;s possible to browse your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transfer time . if he wants to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , you place the different folder and the URL , where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; best , select a basic folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first , you must select the main folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically selected for all future images . thus , you can select either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can verify whether this really all will be visible for viewers . if you select a URL for the Base folder , the URL you have created here , the URL you should set here . otherwise , the web browser will launch in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final target folder , you need to manually copy them manually . thus , the import function , see correctly , you have to specify the final destination of the files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders are . &quot;
&quot; the just described possibilities are based on all three based folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is set up , whose name you set in output folders . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; together , you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have already received a lot of time the image information , persons on the pictures , recep@@ tive , etc . then you have to do with &amp; photo@@ album ; this work will not even be done . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others to your database . the image properties are associated with ex@@ - and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in it if the images are stored in the file or if the file is only a short@@ cut to the file . the advantage of all images in the file is to be saved . the obvious downside is however the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can export a .@@ k@@ im file from either directly from the menu File ... or together with HTML @-@ pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file along with a HTML file , this is an external .@@ c@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ c@@ im file searches the pictures in two times . first , it searches the images that are specified in the folder of .@@ k@@ im file . the corresponding pictures will not be found , so the images of the URL that you have specified when creating HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file via HTML @-@ export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for export images described you can export to the menu File Station . &quot;
&quot; the main option of this dialogue is , whether it is to be internal or external .@@ k@@ in files , the following three choices are available : &quot;
&quot; in the option Manual in the .@@ k@@ im file , you must copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the option Autom@@ atically in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album , the images are automatically for you . &quot;
&quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most of the pictures have been compressed with JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is very small , it usually does not require the files to comp@@ ress . if you do so , simply select the option Export file compressed . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum image size . if you want to send your friends pictures , you might not want to send the pictures in full size as the .@@ k@@ im file otherwise would be very large . here you can limit the size by example , for example , that each picture is to be up to 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; when you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file imports ... select , is used &amp; photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for imports is made up of four steps . first , you must select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import images are to be copied . &quot;
it may be that you person@@ alize the category persons who are called to imported file . therefore you are asked in the third dialogue window that are to be imported in the third dialog window that are to be imported in the third dialog window and which categories are stored in your database .
&quot; in the fourth step , you can edit the categories of the file to imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this is seen on the image . &quot;
&quot; it just needs to be easy to browse and view : when you look at pictures , you often want to look inside various picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you look for example images of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your boyfriend , you may want to see all pictures on which this friend is pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find the different steps from the ( 1 ) feast of the information about your images , via ( 2 ) searches and reputation , through to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ tability . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ album has been started as a program for car@@ et@@ akers of your images . however , it has been expanded and today is also taking care of your videos . in many places in this hand@@ book will be talked about pictures , but frequently this also includes videos . &quot;
&quot; photo album ; saves all of his information in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml in the top folder of her images . this is a simple XML file , which you can secure with a program of your choice , e.g. normal wash@@ tools , copy to a disk or revisions in CVS , where they would like . &quot;
&quot; on photo@@ album , you will notice the folder in which your images are stored and used this at future start @-@ up automatically . if you want to read another folder tree with images , you can start &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; with the option -@@ c . as example : photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; about the menu entry settings on photo@@ album ; set up a window , with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album . in the following section of the user manual , you will explain the different settings options . &quot;
&quot; links you can see six different symbols , with which you can access settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting there is a detailed help you can access the F1 button and click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it has been described as you can create different properties for each picture , e.g. persons , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; you can see the dialog , which is used to process existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a let@@ tering and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog Options , you can set complete membership groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of explaining all groups of a member state as in the section . &quot;
&quot; in view of the settings options available , which are available to you for the fixed list . with the above listed selective list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; shares his module system with other graphic applications such as checking K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin Interface . nutritional information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
&quot; the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; however , most of the modules have a help @-@ page you can access via the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; since the modules can be shared among each other in common , it may be that the modules with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ sets have been tested , so you can select new modules first with the command &gt; photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . say not , I would not have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications which are using modules on K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules can work with &amp; photo@@ album ; this is the downside if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported in albums : this is an album just a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , this type of order does not support , so you can use the order for albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ates &amp; photo@@ album , the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all the images that show you the picture look at the moment . &quot;
&quot; besides the current album , I have to pass on photo@@ photo@@ album , the modules also have a list of albums . here goes on photo@@ photo@@ album , as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser features the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will have the category you have set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . for example , for example , use the category persons , will have been selected &amp; photo@@ album ; so whether you could have selected individuals and transmit it to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules are connected with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album , you can remove these from the list of modules . start the setup dialog , and select in the area modules that modules are to be loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see an example of a laun@@ cher , as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can start with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are accustomed to using any other K@@ DE application , you &apos;ll see quite a menu item - and a tool@@ bar . at the moment you will not see a lot of information about your pictures . in the section we will see you on this window , then click on the entry pictures to show you an overview with all existing images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album , the possibility to see each image with notes . this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture . you can use each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if for example , on all pictures of Jes@@ per , and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these comments can be used for seeking and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; see three lists using a text box by setting persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album , as you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea lies the shifting of images inside the list : if you are illustrated for example a family party and shown on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can find that the used names are moved upwards to find the persons faster and assign . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to list a alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sor@@ ting down on the list below . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected comments on each picture individually , you may still want to edit all selected images and add these pictures with notes . in this case , click on the above and back buttons , which are under the preview of the picture on the top of the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to highlight all these images and to use the menu item multi @-@ more entries at one time with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you see a browser window of the USA as a super@@ group . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special icon will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the catalogue menu , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also take an entry to a category and store it there to make this one sub@@ category of this entry . caution , this pres@@ upp@@ oses your categories alphabe@@ tically . see this . &quot;
&quot; you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the con@@ di@@ alogue by clicking the Le@@ iste , which form the upper edge of the frame , click and post@@ p@@ one . you can also make your own window by clicking it out of the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs , please click the button Options ... that offers you the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also leave a frame completely . if you want to see this window later again , use the button Options ... and here the window will see a / out window . see this process in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry images in the browser , you get an overview with thumb@@ nails of currently selected images , or any images if you do not have a filter . an example of the thumb@@ nails , by simply down drag the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it easy . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; if you click on an image , this will be displayed in the image . if you have not opened a window with a picture name , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete pictures in the picture gallery . simply select the corresponding pictures from which you want to delete , and press either the editing button or select in the Edit menu . now the window will be displayed , which you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; on this problem , you can use a solution for this problem . you can also use &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; namely , you can also use the pictures saved in the hard disk . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; pictures , where the right upper edge is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 however , the thumb@@ nails are present , so &amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; however , you can view these pictures not with the image . &quot;
&quot; as you can see this feature , you need files from folders and copy again . &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album , so far not you want to avoid the inser@@ tion of the corresponding CD . if you wish to avoid trouble , as the mess up of your images , please buy a bigger hard drive to store all the images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu images you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you can filter the pictures so that you may want to see for others un@@ accessible and click on Cur@@ rent View in the menu of privacy . alternatively , you can also select all the pictures that you may see your little sister , and block the menu entry at all except above . &quot;
&quot; so you have specified which pictures will be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu entry . if you want to get the pictures again displayed , click on Sper@@ re up@@ lift . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password which must be entered for locking the images . to set up this password , simply select a password in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; keep in mind that this picture protection is not very safe . for one reason , all pictures on the hard disk and to the other can be able to read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only used to those who stand with &amp; photo@@ album ; not very familiar to rep@@ el the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason you can manage all of your pictures with &amp; photo@@ album ; manage and ask for hours over hours , of course , that you want them to look at some point . for this reason has &amp; photo@@ album . this is why you can preview it from the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer can see you in . he clearly shows the image , but additional all the information you enter into the picture , such as who is on the image , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can easily edit it using the mouse and take you somewhere else . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . you can see the context menu below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are underlined . if you click here on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser displays you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you selected individuals from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene selected . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them and go back by using the buttons image high and image . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also accessible from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as di@@ az@@ au . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image by pressing the Str@@ g button and Plus or minus . the di@@ az@@ au will start by the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S . &quot;
&quot; a very useful skill of the be@@ holder of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch in full screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can easily drag the image and zoom . to Her@@ bal button you can easily drag a rect@@ angle . with the minus button you can get back r@@ zo@@ oming The Plus button zo@@ omed in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not being zo@@ omed . with the uni@@ formity , the zo@@ oms pres@@ upp@@ oses that every pixel corresponds to the screen of a pixel of the picture . &quot;
&quot; note that the only Zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations , that work with videos that are in and out @-@ zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and Minu@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; with the screen@@ ings from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at pictures it may happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can preview the view and view the configuration dialog of the picture , but you will perhaps only prefer to highlight the image and see more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the photos on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the images and mark it as good or bad while you see one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to view images with features , while you &apos;re viewing them . features are the letters A to Z and you can put a characteristic that you press the appropriate letter . in view a picture , where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set the features on your pictures , these are available in the browser . so if you have all the pictures you edit , print , or whatever you have chosen , just add all of them once with notes . this is described in detail . afterwards , you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you can view categories in D@@ re preview view , then you can view characteristics to the images by simply press the letter for the characteristic after the picture was selected . you can see this here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on an image . for this case allows you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on the image to paint .
&quot; the painted is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can und@@ o your painted later . &quot;
in a picture you can see a picture on the painted menu . to switch the painting mode from the context menu . to finish the painting in the tool@@ bar you simply put the cross in the tool@@ bar on top of the window .
&quot; to be able to operate with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , you need to master the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not complete control , but documentation on &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you be read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties tab and shown the object in the wire box views . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple items at the same time . but not the shelter of an already selected object , as all the objects already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to add a new object to the object tree , select the location where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu inser@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; there are multi @-@ possible positions , the following folding menu is applied , so that you can choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; by del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can select previously selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click to apply these changes . you have entered invali@@ d values , a message will be displayed with a error description . then you can then click the input error , or click on the changes with Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user @-@ documentation in the furniture dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the shown object by means of help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the Fe@@ atur@@ ation view . &quot;
&quot; press Pre@@ view in the Fe@@ atur@@ ation View and a small example of the scene is made with the selected texture , even if you want to have a sub@@ ordin@@ ated item ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture Map ) , cross locally . &quot;
the scre@@ enshot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button and thus change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse within the whole window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a wire model for a visual stage . you can indicate this value relative to the Visi@@ bility of an or@@ derly object , or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visual stage is smaller or equal to the scene selected in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; it has a shut@@ down as a default . the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the standard window order or if you need a different arrangement , you can adjust them to any number . you can also save several shut@@ ters and easily switch between different agen@@ das . &quot;
&quot; to view a window above or below a view , drag the beginning to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to re@@ arrange multiple views on each other , drag the beginning to another view . you can then change between views by clicking on the hand@@ card leaders in the view . &quot;
&quot; the last possible shut@@ ters are Swedish views : views which are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the beginning to the desktop or click on the little to the left of the top arrow in the belt bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the tool@@ bar . to prevent the left , click on the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu View , you will find entries for any type of view . new views are woven , you can anchor them to any location . &quot;
&quot; the current window view can save you with view windows . it will display a dialog , where you can save the window order under an existing or new name . &quot;
&quot; if you created a scene , you can ren@@ ders it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program has to be properly installed , was &amp; Pov@@ ray . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 does not support . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ ders the current scene , click on the icon ren@@ ders The icon ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry scene ren@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; a r@@ ender mode matches the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the size and quality of the ren@@ ders . if you want to insert a scene in various image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full pictures in the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon of The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or in the menu View R@@ ender modes ... select , the following dialogue will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each player mode has a name . you can input any name , but sense is a name that can recognize the characteristics of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the mapping size you can fill the width and height of the en@@ rolled image . if you only want a small area of the image , select the sub@@ section sub@@ section and enter the image section to get into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination field quality , you can select the properties that uses &amp; Pov@@ ray . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual on &amp; Pov@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; if a picture is made with only a beam depending on pixels , there may be different mistakes . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or stu@@ d effect in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray uses technology called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this capacity will be better . &quot;
&quot; when you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculated and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than a beam depending on pixels . this technique is called super sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive approach ; adap@@ tive because every pixel is repeat@@ ed@@ ely further divided and adap@@ tive because every pixel is repeat@@ ed@@ ely further divided and adap@@ tive because the rec@@ tory width depends on the calculated colors . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tr@@ acked a beam depending on pixels . if you adjust the difference between the color values to the neighboring pixels with super sampling . if you adjust the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x@@ 4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive approach starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the pre@@ determined threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub@@ pixel , which can be followed individually and checked for further sub@@ ordination . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of smokers for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch J@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the beams make a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for quality of Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light reflection calcul@@ ates . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this list , you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays are not hit the object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for viewing the &amp; Pov@@ ray display . if &amp; Pov@@ ray is termin@@ ated , you can find the reason for this here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray , select the menu entry file imports ... and select in the dialog window a file . &quot;
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler currently does not support the complete command of &amp; Pov@@ ray . if import error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all the messages . &quot;
if you do not support code text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler you want to import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can export objects from the object tree in the editor to export the code text for &amp; Pov@@ ray . this adds the code text of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply tick the code text in the editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot;
&quot; with copying and inser@@ ts in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; POV @-@ Ray command is called , if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually , this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the Help section , opens &amp; Po@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : the &amp; Pov@@ ray . user documentation on the shown object . place the path to your documents and version . supported the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; looking for external files ( for example al@@ timeter ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also fill the path to those files here . if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color will be used for viewing the selected objects .
the colour for the check@@ points . the second color will be used for viewing the selected check@@ points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the view field in the camera view and in the window @-@ type label .
&quot; you can set the object catch the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set up the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; larger values provide a more accurate wire model , and thus better approxim@@ ation for the objects shown , but require more time for ren@@ ders . for some objects such as the ball you can adjust the details stage for two directions . &quot;
&quot; when you cross High detail@@ fi@@ del@@ ity for extended proj@@ ections , all the wire @-@ model views are further divided , when the camera is an extended projection . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical proj@@ ections . this property gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; when you show a wall , a wall is cut behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a chess brake pattern from two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you show ground , a bottom is controlled below the objects . the floor is displayed in a chess brake pattern from two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you tick can@@ op@@ tionally , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . more precise information on parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender modes . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can modify existing shut@@ ters or create new shut@@ ters . in the section shut@@ ters will be explained how to create window arrangements . &quot;
the default field standard window : displays all existing shut@@ ters . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program .
&quot; the list of existing shut@@ ters shows all existing shut@@ ters . a new arrangement can be used with the button adding , and delete a selected arrangement with the button del@@ e@@ tion . &quot;
every window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below shows all views of the chosen window order . new views can be removed with the button adding and selected views with the button removal .
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column , create a new column on the right side of the available window , with features , you will be able to view the window under the existing window , with car@@ tei@@ ing . view the view not in the main window , but creates a se@@ perate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : installed and now you want to follow without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you can follow all steps in this guide , you should create the Ultimate but simple scene at the beginning : a bul@@ let on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully note the following warnings , before you complain that you as a result will only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for first time you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black image . &quot;
&quot; when you insert no light sources , your entire scene is in the dark , and you only get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you have all error @-@ free installed , you can see the following shut@@ ters at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation , so that you can obtain an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; start with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the item tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry to delete . thus , you now have a scene with no objects . &quot;
the wire model view shows how the camera views the whole scene that you generate . especially notice the scene from the point of view of the camera . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you can find the content of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation on &amp; Pov@@ ray , you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but note that the camera can change in the view control points , with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on a check@@ point and drag it to the desired place . &quot;
&quot; when you apply the button or press the input box , change the wire model views and the object tree immediately follow these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could insert for example a Qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body Qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a hassle method for solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : actually offers a simpler possibility . you can use an infinite level as a ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and press the button @-@ key . the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view also shows the layer , although at the moment only as a limited end@@ setting level . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the plane extends to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re watching the item tree precisely , you will notice that you can click the entry for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit under the horizon line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shifting and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first , select the ground to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something easy at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases a dialog opens in which you can choose how the object is to be inserted . please select your item ( name = floor @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview , see how the pig@@ ment now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments only shows a few black material because you can still check settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , you can always check the colors for the pig@@ ment . also , there are many options now , but take the easiest way now . &quot;
&quot; if you do not see any color on the he@@ aders and ball , then click on the button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the ground is now correct . if you ren@@ ders your picture now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the colo@@ uring . you have to enter two new attributes . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; choose in the subject area of every@@ time , and change the colors in the view of the properties tab : &quot;
&quot; this step should be easy to execute , as you should have understood the basic functioning of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : the ball is just as easy to create as the ground : &quot;
&quot; in view of the properties tab , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input box or the button ) , so the ball would float over the ground as you have moved the ground to a unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering results from now a strange result : as previously seen before , the ball surface appears like a low @-@ black material . put in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to you now . as already on the ground , you give the ball a pig@@ ment as a colour : &quot;
&quot; select your object and change the name for example in the sphere of pig@@ ment . click on the pig@@ ment Pig@@ ment , select then einf@@ ar@@ n and present the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; however , you can achieve interest@@ ingly effects if you take the time to adjust some finish features : &quot;
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click on it or press the input box .
&quot; the settings gle@@ am effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what opportunities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler offers . hopefully , you have already learned so much to create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tracing is a r@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; if you &apos;re a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en , sho@@ ots the Ren@@ derer hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that affect the scenes ) by each pixel in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as ne@@ b@@ ula . so , the scene pixel is processed for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you also need nothing , the image is simple . obviously , every scene , which should be controlled , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in usual file dialog , you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
&quot; opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file which you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replace the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . it is a new file , you need to enter a name and a disk space . &quot;
&quot; once again , the scene has been released in the last released version . all changes since the last storage will be rejected . &quot;
you can only select this menu item if you have not yet stored stored changes in the scene .
&quot; repeated the least un@@ made command . this menu entry , you can only select if you have used editing . &quot;
&quot; saves the current window order and opens a dialog , where you can enter a name for a new order or write an existing arrangement . &quot;
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the standard behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new files using this option .
opens a dialog to set up the tool . you can add and remove with this option tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands to add and remove .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to create rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geom@@ etrical form of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for both B@@ ump @-@ Map as well as for a texture map .
&quot; basic bodies are simple geom@@ etric shapes , which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens of or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further edited to give them a realistic appearance . &quot;
&quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , using a picture @-@ file as a color card . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image editing and browser . the application has a file browser , where you can choose images to display . &quot;
images can be displayed either in an own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can click with clicking the button &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the key returns can be displayed .
you can set whether each image is to be displayed in your own window or if all images are to always use the same window .
&quot; if you are searching for a specific file , just enter the first signs of the file in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if you have a suitable fil@@ en@@ ame , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in dialogue - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five mapping cards . in three of them , General and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set in the two others , short @-@ command for the display and short @-@ command for the browser , you can set the short@@ cut for the respective windows . &quot;
&quot; if this is selected , the pictures will be displayed in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display surface is filled with the background color that you can set down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; if this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already see the next picture in the folder while you still look at the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture , and is particularly suitable for a slide show . &quot;
with this option save &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when running the name of the last opened folder . the next start opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored beams to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can create &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , so that only a few of the file types will be displayed , which can also display the program . &quot;
this option is magni@@ fying for large images the display display on the full screen . this option is switched off as a default .
determine whether the sli@@ deshow is to start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; the time span between image changes at a sli@@ deshow . to change the value , you can insert a new value in the input field or the sli@@ der or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;

&quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; try to give you so much control over its working procedures as possible . there are many options that access the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; set up in this settings , you need to set up the menu settings show@@ photo ; you can change between these settings by pressing the symbols of the left . &quot;
&quot; in the field of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator was selected . de@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can view this page in which you can click on one of the five rider : &quot;
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that do not make more than pictures to scan and play .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that don &apos;t make more than pictures to scan and roll . &amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can save for each picture a dialog to save or save the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by typing the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a default scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; using the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in terminal . if this scanner has not been opened or if no default scanner is specified then a dialog to select the scanner is opened .
&quot; the user can select the scanner to be used , and press OK to open the scanner . stop &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; quit . &quot;
the further settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( li@@ b@@ ks@@ ane ) do not treat these options especially .
&quot; to can@@ es a picture , the user can only start a pre @-@ slip and then look for scanning area for the final scan . the Vor@@ sch@@ can is started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to select the picture better , the user can get into the image and out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom so that the complete preview fits in the window . &quot;
if the image is selected then the final picture can be read with the scan button .
&quot; when I view a preview display in the settings , the picture is displayed in a preview display , as shown below is displayed . if saving is pressed , then the image is stored and s@@ lie ? s leads to a break and you will get back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the button settings , the same name is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the picture if desired , before saving . in this case the option must be displayed on storing a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; pictures save . dialog to save each picture opens the dialog in front of each set @-@ called picture . if &amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically saved with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must choose to ask for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this option defines where images stored in the option save for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as standard for dialogue to store . the default value is your home directory and you can change this using the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the images automatically to storage images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to store . the automatically stored picture gets a numer@@ ical view@@ ix of each time is stored , the string # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
&quot; the user can customize the image quality for storing image quality . this value also changes the compression value for saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value is used by Q@@ t . &quot;
the button help launches the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button more than starts the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to stop &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&quot; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; used like all other programs keyboard short@@ cut . below you can set up a list of these cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cut you can set up by right mouse button in the player window and select Glob@@ ale short@@ cut , by right click in the player window and select short @-@ command ... &quot;
&quot; you may need to set existing multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; -@@ short @-@ command line . thus , you can make your keyboard on &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; control center . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ COP interface of Amar@@ o@@ ok has many general functions , which mostly can be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , and scripts . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ok supports the command lines of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ o@@ ok has some own command @-@ lines options . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user an feedback if the script can not be executed because of a lack of dependency . please check in your script , whether all the required modules are present and use k@@ dialog , so that the user knows why a script does not run . &quot;
Beg@@ in require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE Bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is a sport for this script . &apos; t@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
&quot; in the folder Scrip@@ ts / templates , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the base for your own scripts , or simply extend it to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ COP you can exchange your scripts with Amar@@ o@@ ok and Amar@@ o@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should fit any K@@ DE installation . &quot;
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the exec@@ uting external programs and commands . in this way the function ex@@ ec is used &gt; relatively easy . here is an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; sends messages to all running scripts . for this reason , scripts should be monitored continuously and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure We@@ is the script to display the furniture dialog . to save the storing and loading of the furniture data , each script needs to take care of . if a script will start , Amar@@ o@@ OK sets the work@@ folder onto the folder , where all data should be saved . &quot;
tr@@ ack@@ change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script can now be used &amp; eg ; with D@@ COP functions to ask for more information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the denom@@ ination ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume sign@@ alizes a change of volume . the new volume is an integer of 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ izing : sub@@ menu entry , revealing the path to the selected files of the playlist when a user @-@ defined menu entry can be identified . to add a entry to the selected item d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ box P@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu @-@ Tit@@ le ) . to remove an entry again , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu @-@ Tit@@ le ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; finished , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; the signal S@@ IG@@ TER@@ M sends to the script . this signal should be processed to work for example , for example to store data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , which can be optional also with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , so that the user can clearly see the archive as a Amar@@ o@@ OK script package . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Exten@@ sive script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right properly . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining to load@@ able modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameters -@@ p to obtain the file rights : &quot;
&quot; when your script package is ready , you can load it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; attach the category Amar@@ o@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly simple to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; you can easily drag music to the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus within your collection . maybe you are looking for a very specific title made of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; &apos; s collector browser and the Quick Search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you have already some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult to choose , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . moreover , many different audio systems can be used so you can listen to your music . these and yet many more useful features make Amar@@ o@@ ok for the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ o@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to recre@@ ate your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually you have to enter the following folder of Amar@@ o@@ sources , to compile and install Amar@@ o@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should have no difficulties when compile no difficulties . if you encounter problems please report this to the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; has the most applications some options , which you can enable or disable a comp@@ iling point with the configure script . this is a list of options available . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . details about this can be found in the system requirements . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ ging de@@ bu@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you would like to help the development of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; you should use full use . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; can be set up with no effort on the furniture dialog . the furniture dialog has several car@@ esses for setting up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ;
&quot; players window display the player windows in addition to the playlist , respectively . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window is displayed . &quot;
&quot; voting bar@@ ometer is available : this function is only available , if &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option turns the experimental function of the voting bar@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; arrangement of design : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , the used color scheme is altered for m@@ bar@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; voting files on the music files put down : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . otherwise , the .@@ stationary files will be stored in the settings folder of the respective music files . otherwise , the .@@ All files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
&quot; external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , should be started when a browser is needed . &quot;
&quot; use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above . &quot;
&quot; to save the playlist , save the current playlist automatically at the Be@@ end of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; activate this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when moving out . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use it . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files will be saved . &quot;
actual play can be seen visible in the piece @-@ shift that the play@@ lists window up to the play@@ lists in order to keep the current piece always in the visible window area .
switching to the context @-@ browser automatically shows the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played .
&quot; in the section appearance , you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ o@@ OK &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the fonts section , you can use the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; you can select fonts for the following area : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context @-@ browser . press on Ex@@ selecting ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of custom color scheme , you will have the choice of choice and can set up your own color scheme . use the below for the activated color selection for front and background colour . &quot;
&quot; reproduction in the start process , that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; after the program start playing the playback automatically with the piece in place , with which they stopped at the last stop . &quot;
the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to display the OS@@ D . if on @-@ screen display is displayed , a preview of the OS@@ D will display and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is the font . click to select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OS@@ D . the cross panel shadows causes the text in the OS@@ D sh@@ aded .
own colors gives you the possibility to customize the OS@@ D colors for scrip@@ ture and background . click on the color @-@ surfaces open the dialog to the color selection . if their own colors do not use activated the pre @-@ placed &amp; k@@ ills ; colors are used .
the input field text shows the text shown in the OS@@ D . by the type of space the OS@@ D can be adjusted to your own needs . below you will find a list of space available space and what they mean .
&quot; the option screen is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi @-@ speed monitor , the OS@@ D should appear . &quot;
the mapping audio output lets you choose an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers enable further settings in this field .
the mapping collection will be used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; to search a folder in the collection , select the cross @-@ box next to its name . this section also contains an@@ cross@@ fields to setup , as should be done with selected folders . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ folder Rel@@ ated : this causes , that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders as well as their sub@@ folders . &quot;
&quot; modifications : allows &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( for example , if music files added or deleted ) . furthermore , a incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
play@@ lists import : causes &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ itude and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection will then appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part of the file database is used for selecting a database for the collection . the combination field drivers : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected , there is another set up in the sub @-@ window My@@ S@@ ql setup . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ ql @-@ device is used for setting up the database for &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; on which the machine is inserted , on which the My@@ S@@ ql database is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name , to which the connection is made . &quot;
use the user name : and password : to enter the data required for the connection to the database .
the car@@ n@@ map last@@ .@@ f@@ m is directed to support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; can submit the names of different pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
&quot; here you can enter your username and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
&quot; send pieces and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; , the names of the played pieces on your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . &quot;
&quot; similar interpre@@ ters call : after activation of this setting , &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters to the each played piece . note : you can not use a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; eg ; Linux ) . for more information please see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos .
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ok needs only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have K@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the programs included , for example &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide , how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as the OS@@ D pres@@ upp@@ oses that your window manager will work the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . thus , Gn@@ ome will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ o@@ ok on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these are an excellent development environment . &quot;
probably one of your files will make an error in the day@@ light library . you can see the file fin@@ ely by using it in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / Amar@@ ok / collection _ scan@@ .@@ log . please report this mistake to the tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang out the cap@@ ut@@ te file that causes the crash . after that you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly this is that Tag@@ lib cras@@ hes out of this file during reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file . please report this error to the day@@ light developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok &apos;s libraries were compiled using the same comp@@ iler version . if for example &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , tag@@ li@@ b , but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x compiled , then this leads to overthrow the met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable it . switch off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound @-@ system , or do not use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically with a cras@@ hing ) . if it is a frequently down@@ turn down@@ turn , and you can send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be guaranteed . &quot;
this is because many program data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 write in the met@@ a @-@ info but not identify as Uni@@ code . the following per@@ l script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b@@ - &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; Set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ C@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / Dynam@@ o playlist ) see in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can click the status De@@ activated on grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol until this attitude shows its effect . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ ic@@ uous symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ m@@ ap@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ o@@ OK uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ R@@ amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ atory Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf@@ uses that Amar@@ o@@ ok will find the right version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation problems be the easiest way through the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or for developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only one mistake if something is located at the removal of a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
&quot; after the start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , only a blank playlist . how do music come in ? &quot;
this is easy . use the file browser to the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start @-@ window was converted into the statisti@@ c window . you will find it under ex@@ tras . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed to Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to evaluate pieces , in the playlist you need to display the application column , click on the title bar of the playlist and select column . click anywhere in the new application column . you can also use the short @-@ command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ o@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your choice and then select from playlist out of the folding menu . &quot;
drag a playlist file with your mouse to the playlist and drop it there exactly as you would do with other files too . so simple is that : - )
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , directly next to the add @-@ button , there is the button playlist . click on it . &quot;
&quot; probably you &apos;re missing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; new . look again after li@@ b@@ ish , this package includes many very nice visu@@ alizations . &quot;
&quot; the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . besides , you can find it via the menu bar under ex@@ tras ... &quot;
&quot; no . yes , that is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question is what media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM ! &quot;
&quot; it may ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will not be supplied in the default ( for pat@@ ent@@ ative reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s starting : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ ather driver with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device must be offered a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and time streaming audio ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mix@@ er ) . take a look at the help D@@ mix for Al@@ sa . &quot;
the output of this command should help you in finding the problem for a problem and find a solution . you may need to specify a different s@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ ine ) .
&quot; this is &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; already , don &apos;t forget that media must first de@@ co@@ ded . you can only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice if you &apos;re looking for a decree or with little over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ co@@ ded it and sends the PC@@ M data to Al@@ sa . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS de@@ co@@ ded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can spend directly on Al@@ sa , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . activate the sound server with highest priority ( real time ) and increase the size of the sound bu@@ ffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper SU@@ ID is set to : &quot;
&quot; at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause sul@@ ated playback . read this error report . the magni@@ fying of the Sound Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your al@@ sa furnishings file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ stretching or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia complete to obtain the faster Arts @-@ co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ m@@ pe@@ gli@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; probably you use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been heavily optimised for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts d@@ ffer in the control center and sound &amp; Multimedia , sound system . the less the size of the bu@@ ffer , the less yields react to visu@@ alizations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ stretching is installed , but when I would like to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cras@@ hes &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; off . why ? &quot;

&quot; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike classic field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : ) &quot;
&quot; thanks to D@@ COP , this is already possible . set in your calendar program an alarm and leave with the alarm to perform this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ player play &quot;
&quot; this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; playing back . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be wo@@ ken by the gentle pots of the music that you have stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how can you get up to date in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles when one is on another computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment is present you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ t and title of the running piece : ssh -@@ i ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP _ R@@ SA
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this pres@@ upp@@ oses that your identification is available in the ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA file .

&quot; basically , this fits the previous assessment by a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has every single rating on the overall result . &quot;

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital audio ) . on the internet such programs are commonly referred to as Ripper .
&quot; O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patented and professional technology for audio enco@@ ding and for handling audio data flows . O@@ GG benefits benefits from Open Source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and Encoder modules . &quot;
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ audio de@@ coder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers of Lay@@ er I , Lay@@ er II and Lay@@ er III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported by the MP3 de@@ coder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a far developed MP3 de@@ coder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 @-@ Encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss of audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C de@@ coder module and the external audio module module so you can read FLA@@ C files .
&quot; Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Muse@@ pack Dec@@ oder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible for example to de@@ code the files to convert an audio CD to burning .@@ de@@ co &quot;
so@@ x : an aid program that can go between different audio formats - and convert . so@@ x is used by the so@@ x audio Encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you need it when you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ CD@@ Ima@@ ger : one in the function@@ all@@ - complete author &apos;s system to manipulate , dis@@ assemb@@ ling and analysis of video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful for example , for creating a mix@@ er CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections , without norm@@ alize the different recording levels of different albums on the invisible effect , which will be reproduced differently according to the music pieces . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and can automatically reproduce all videos in the base folder of the CD .
&quot; this is a convenient method , recently opened projects again . the corresponding sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry will open the project . &quot;
&quot; saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name . &quot;
&quot; saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save is displayed , with which you can choose folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file . &quot;
&quot; stores all opened projects , which is the same as if you were to access the file for every single project file . &quot;
&quot; if a project is changing and not saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what has to happen . you can then break between storing and changes . besides , you can then break down and keep the project opened . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will inqu@@ ire for each of the project on what has to happen , just as if you have called for each project file . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects and termin@@ ates &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each of the stored project it will be asked , what it should happen , as if you were called a file . &quot;
&quot; when you call this entry , you can choose to select the current dialogue files to add to the project . this has the same effect as if you &apos;re drawing the files directly from the upper view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; open the dialogue &quot; &quot; burning &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to burning the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened when the project already contains data . &quot;
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make a lot of project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings that most of them are described above the What is that ? -@@ Help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
&quot; this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful when you get files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you use files for a multi @-@ session CD , even if this function is not used for you , so that you can already see existing files and folder on the medium . &quot;
&quot; this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function led &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files are not removed from the medium , it only bl@@ ends the previously imported files again . &quot;
&quot; opens the CD @-@ copying dialog . this allows even without project file using a CD onto another medium . alternatively , you can also only create an image of a CD instead of normal cop@@ ier . you should also prefer the possibility of buying a CD instead of normal cop@@ ier . you should also prefer to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; opens the DVD copy dialog . this allows even without project file using a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only get an image of a DVD instead of normal cop@@ ier . furthermore , there is also the possibility of buying a DVD with the help of copying , so the target medium must be large enough to absorb the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
&quot; open the dialog to the form@@ atting of a DVD . with this dialogue , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the contents can be completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the spelling and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; burns a previously created CD @-@ image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then immediately be supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , for this you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burns a previously created DVD collection . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a source of data , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; a previously used DVD video can be converted . thereby , this dialog window appears usually used after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used all @-@ standing video , enco@@ ding settings and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the in@@ occasional medium . this information is displayed in the contents view , and contain characteristics of the medium , such as size and title @-@ length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool @-@ making of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is enabled , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; when this is crossed , a small bar list at the bottom of the window appears . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view one or off . the folder view is an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information , locking and locking the tre@@ ad@@ ress or throw of the medium . &quot;
the table view enables the view to select and drop files into the projection view . the table view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs that a drive is selected using a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
&quot; the copy box is switched on in the projection view or out . the p@@ iste is a narro@@ wer area , which is only visible when the projection view has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the projection view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialogue window to change the ke@@ ystro@@ kes for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after having selected one of the commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key@@ boards below . &quot;
&quot; this will start the K@@ 3@@ b ; furnishings . therefore , the correct per@@ missions required for burning CDs and DVDs are set . therefore , system managers need to enter the password for the system managers ( root ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here , general programs may be made . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on an@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is meant to person@@ alize and become the refinement of the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ ways ; applications also equipped with one &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . with the help of this interface parts of functionality allows for example to be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions to use , you can either use the command @-@ line program d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the function@@ all@@ age , therefore , it is rather your taste and the way of your task . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we assume that you can use the command @-@ line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; to use , you must previously make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; start . then enter something like the following at the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions which have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in common , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below . &quot;
&quot; the Standard D@@ COP @-@ Interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; displays functions like copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other features for generating new projects . &quot;
D@@ COP@@ f cre@@ ate@@ aux CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ f cre@@ ate@@ aux D@@ vi@@ x@@ e@@ List@@ lt ( ) D@@ COP@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ f cre@@ ate@@ aux D@@ v@@ d ( ) Vo@@ id ( ) Vo@@ id ( ) Vo@@ id ( K@@ ur@@ f ) Vo@@ id tam@@ n@@ c@@ d@@ image ( K@@ ur@@ ur@@ l ) Vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ ur@@ ur@@ l ) Vo@@ id _ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ ur@@ ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ f ( K@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can obtain a project via the command line : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project D@@ urch using this reference is it possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b provides the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the performance K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which is applicable only on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; Vo@@ id cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) Vo@@ id tor@@ ch ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string Par@@ ent ) Vo@@ id remo@@ ver ( Q@@ string path ) Vo@@ id ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string Path ) Vo@@ id ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ name ) Vo@@ id set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id ) &quot;
&quot; for example , it is possible to fill a data @-@ project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates an data project , several folders and then adds files to the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der &apos;s cash / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p / some@@ fi@@ le@@ .txt / fo@@ o / bar
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ les@@ bian for &amp; k@@ esh ; with it , you can easily read audio CD ; s read and be stored in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the Encoder which is installed on the machine . &quot;
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading from &amp; CD ; data in W@@ AV files on the hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that have to be installed in Linux distribution ) . further enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
&quot; first , the titles of the &amp; CD will be read and stored in W@@ AV files on the machine ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
in a second step these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) compressed to the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format or also other formats like the loss @-@ free FLA@@ C .
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia used . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed yet , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ es ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ es ( for MP3 ) or other co@@ di@@ ers have already been installed , so it is probably not necessary to compile some Linux distri@@ butions you need . if for example FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is not required . &quot;
&quot; which Ko@@ di@@ ff / File format is to be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer is a small introduction of enco@@ ding , audio quality and compres@@ sing factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the protection of audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not possible to handle any cop@@ ier protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD @-@ device the protection is not possible , it is not possible to avoid any cop@@ ier protection . simply avoid buying the copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while setting up only once to be made ( the furniture dialog can be called as often until a suitable configuration ) , afterwards the daily approach to reading a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , via which you are frequently stum@@ ble across the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which co@@ ding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc . ) &quot;
can &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB can get out of the Internet or can operate completely without any network using everything manually .
&quot; this is just a short list of commands from the main window . on the page step by step example , more information , such as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program . &quot;
will the CD@@ DB request to start the CD data corresponding to the installation of your request in the tab CD@@ DB . ( this can be locally or online in the latter case must first be the connection to the Internet . )
start reading and - if a Encoder is configured in the tab enco@@ ding settings - the code .
&quot; opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder , so that the selection with another Encoder is to be read as the standard . it is to be noted that the Encoder is configured using co@@ ding settings in the furniture dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already read file is selected rather than a full &amp; CD , to read and de@@ code . &quot;
opens the interior dialog to configure the type of aler@@ ts ( like protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; end ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main pilot dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different mapping cards ( such as Encoder , to setup the end ) . so here you have to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ding and compres@@ sible rates and helps you choose the right code . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss of free audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also others like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats , the information collected by data compressed according to their psycho@@ analysis are the most common . O@@ GG likes to have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences become less important as both co@@ di@@ ers are very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; o &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions . &quot;
&quot; + tall to high quality sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality in deeper bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a machine or machine @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG devices is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB Stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - in the beginning 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This option should usually offer for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , compression rate about 5.5 . needs ever 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R joint stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good Gen@@ u@@ g for music of young people , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ os@@ ystem . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this attitude will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
the &amp; CD ; information which is manually caught manually or by the program automatically from the free@@ DB over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be handed / used to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files .
&quot; in connection with co@@ ding programs , there is often a combination of program opinion for the enco@@ ding and these parameters here . the manual or help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programmes . &quot;
for example to add the &amp; CD : title to the keywords ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are co@@ ded with l@@ ame the switches has to be added from l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button drawing in the assistant ) :
&quot; this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which individuals can download the audio CDs to enter the information instead of using text : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc . , not by the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal but I ( An@@ m of the actu@@ ator ) is not an attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; any more or less value , so neither the artist nor the music company are damaged . all information can be saved in a bum@@ ble@@ bee by a &amp; CD ; store , physically or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active a cross @-@ box address ( Send an address ) . for the use of free@@ DB may be used with another ( counterf@@ eit ) address used in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ bution the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , set up for the use of free@@ DB , the geo@@ graphi@@ cally is needed at the nearest mirror server . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines . &quot;
&quot; a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org delivers a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the actu@@ alizations of the database . &quot;
which instructor will be used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; stored in W@@ AV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that this c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see to note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must be installed first , if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to save the full W@@ AV files , the enco@@ ding and hence the desired file format can be chosen . at first opening are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compres@@ sing for audio data ) on the tab for setting up the code . other enco@@ ders can be added to this tab . &quot;
the enco@@ ding package needs to be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the enco@@ ding can be used . this is also required for pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders are located in the chapter of Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; after installing a code , you can get more information about his switches by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a context window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the establishment of the device @-@ drawing of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the des@@ ks and reading real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc . ) . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong . &quot;
&quot; check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD , check out the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed ! &quot;
&quot; there is a chapter with a step for step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; read the complete manual , everything understood , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
in this example we will launch the program for the first time everything up and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ boards ( tags ) .
&quot; it must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your machine . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , whatever you can do of course . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have scre@@ aming up on it ( eg by trying to copy with the con@@ quer@@ or something ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that is supposed to be done only once , and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD , which must be repeated for any read &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; here we determine the use of enco@@ ding to compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 until 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are lazy , we divide the program to load the free@@ DB around the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will likely not change it with each reading a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device @-@ drawing is handed over to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
&quot; frequently , / dev / CD@@ ROM is a symbolic link to the actual equipment designation of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , even if on the drive with other programs , you can also get a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the available entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
the mapping card of General settings . here are not much to do . here can an additional transformation be defined . in our example everything is shown in the scre@@ enshot and shown as shown in the scre@@ enshot .
&quot; only For un@@ complete information can be requested , so that you will be informed if details are missing from key@@ word ( tags ) . &quot;
the mapping card ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and release the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded over the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the machine must be connected while reading the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet to access the free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry was immediately found immediately when you are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the fil@@ en@@ ame / fil@@ en@@ ame or day entries , they can be easily changed using the database entry and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , further notice : if you want to enter everything manually , so de@@ activate the selection fields and free@@ DB will not be used . however , it can be selected using free@@ DB locally . however , the two choices must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following mapping card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for the retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server via the Internet . how does the system , which data the CD will get ? read the section about free@@ DB . set everything in the scre@@ enshot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look after a mirror server nearby . on this way , the load between the machines will be distributed . however , this setting will work as a first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both function equally , as regards the server , since many fire@@ walls are bo@@ iling the protocol 8@@ 80 default , maybe more happiness with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to submit any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . the first crossing should be dis@@ abling .
simply take the settings from the scre@@ enshot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; number at the same time : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time only an existing drive ? parallel reading and co@@ ding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try ourselves . &quot;

&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you cross this cross , then / must be specified on the path / folder in which the W@@ AV files are stored , the files will not be displayed in the private folder . if you don &apos;t forget this folder , if you want to do something with the W@@ AV files . &quot;
&quot; everything can enter as it is at the scre@@ enshot . the command is somewhat long , under certain circumstances something needs to be pu@@ ffed up to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . the resulting compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction on generating tags on Version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags you can also be deleted . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; Day for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .

&quot; number of W@@ AV files at the same time : with a Du@@ al@@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , more than a W@@ AV file can be used simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; this is it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is used as standard for each reading a &amp; CD ; used . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section is described how the process of reading the &amp; CD is running . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , as we are convenient and the new CD ; data from the free@@ DB file is described , needs to be repeated for each read &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; as we use a &amp; CD , which is not included in free@@ DB , watch the screen sn@@ apshots a bit different from the data for a &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn to insert the &amp; CD ; data manually instead of using it from the Internet . comments will be displayed on the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet to happen , now the &amp; CD has to be put into the drive , which has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and its length are listed in the window , just as in the scre@@ enshot . this only when the &amp; CD is identified ; as audio CD , could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
if this is not happening you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings .
&quot; note : if the &amp; CD was successfully picked up by the free@@ DB , all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album are shown . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there is a window appears , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion is best to your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have selected the junction box for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for settings ) , you can also manually trigger you by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - entry of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Cur@@ rent title &apos; to the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
&quot; the artist needs no longer be entered in the input field &apos; Cur@@ rent title &apos; , unless you have a selection with different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for individual comments ini@@ di@@ versions per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all the pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful withdrawal of data from the free@@ DB , the CD editor is not empty , but it contains already the data as shown in the screen shot . however , it &apos;s always a good idea to start the content of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words with large letters are beginning or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any undes@@ irable comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ tags . this limited the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have in@@ limited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set up at the tab enco@@ ding settings ; take a look at the section &apos; basic settings &apos; . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information generated at any time using the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see in the help of the enco@@ ding to get more information .
simply select an entry which is apparent with the style of the out@@ lining CD . in this example this is not important as we do not submit the &amp; CD data anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are to be found under Rock .
after the choice of &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor will appear again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the data we &apos;ve collected for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece in any case and other information you desire .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear when you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the piece list .
&quot; note that there is a check @-@ sign in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are selected . a simple click on the line divi@@ des the selection of the piece , or click the button All pieces select at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; was started by clicking on the button selection and read the reading process , then this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab orders for switching on the order window . it is in the left half of the window , right under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is currently read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the bottom line of the window , in the status bar . &quot;
this error message will see if you are trying to work with a enco@@ ding you have not yet installed . pieces which have not been successful co@@ ded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the tmp file and the target folder are not what we have entered here for example . have you checked whether you have writing to the folder for temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the mistake occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the enco@@ ding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , reading and de@@ code parallel . notice the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has found no configuration setting to sup@@ press this behavior . the only thing seems to be configur@@ able . the only thing is unclear is the result unclear . the used machine with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and co@@ ding ( of however two different pieces ) .
&quot; now the latest title is read , while another piece is co@@ ded and a third order is co@@ ded in the queue . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window appears . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ ding of your choice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is today maintained within the &amp; k@@ de ; CVS as part of the k@@ dem@@ ul@@ ti@@ media package . however , if you use CVS , you can download from there an anonymous copy . however , most distri@@ butions are already included in the package . if you &apos;re reading this , you have probably already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to individuals who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs if it is running once , then the following is right for you : &quot;
a program that calls for many different programs has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of different car@@ esses of settings and also contains comments for options that may not be used for example .
&quot; hello , still alive ? even if only the help menu has been clicked , after the first start of the program , without any clue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive ) , or from the unusual short menu ? &quot;
&quot; what is it ? who reads this , probably has already started the program . it should look something like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author can not maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is intended to do something useful . and if you are reading this , he left this section and therefore agree with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange if it is able to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need those information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kara@@ oke Bar by &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others , he has with real @-@ time gra@@ ver@@ fi@@ k and kar@@ a@@ oke @-@ authenticity of texts also some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; C@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the OS@@ S system , so it should work on all systems with OS@@ S and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports &amp; Linux ; ultra @-@ time proj@@ ector , who is needed for CIS cards . al@@ sa is included as soon as there is a sequ@@ en@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; in mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so that it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI @-@ channel as by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can move in &amp; k@@ de ; each MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to the cap .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song@@ writing or text events ) . K@@ mid automatically determines the procedure used in each case .
&quot; seat support . if you &amp; k@@ de ; stopping during the playing of a song , K@@ mid starts again next time with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI @-@ synthes@@ iz@@ ers , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P drivers and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the menu File . it appears the usual file dialog , with whose help you can choose the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; this will also work with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and pressing the button bar in tool@@ bar , select the entry file from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts when you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid , window . ( in several pieces they will be added to a collection and then re @-@ played . ) &quot;
&quot; once you play a piece , you can jump to any point by using the middle mouse button and drive up with the ship . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow down , you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo of tempo and so change the speed speed . to re@@ click back the original speed , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the blank is two tasks : when a piece is played down , a pressure on the blank is like a pressure on the button pause or select the menu entry in the menu item , so play the playback . pressing the blank while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be saved to two species in a piece of music . some pieces are using text event , others use lyrics and again other both . some pieces do not have a text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set out which events are to be presented and even better : the E@@ ign@@ ist@@ ype is automatically determined that a song is used , so you have to adjust nothing manually . so if you choose to adjust the entry Settings text automatically , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to adjust to an Ere@@ ign@@ ist@@ ype , select from the menu settings the entries of text events or sun@@ beds . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you summar@@ ize . these are played in the row . in this section , as you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to put a collection , open up the collecting manager . you will find it in the menu Collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection is included in the beginning the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the same wish in collecting managers . &quot;
&quot; into the temporary collection , all the songs you want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection is not stored . concerns you when you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in collecting managers . there you can add a song with the button adding . it appears in the file dialog , with whose help you can choose the desired song . &quot;
&quot; a second method to add a song , depends on the setting of automatic add to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if automatic add is activated , a piece by opening ( using file opening or drag and drop ) automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; if automatic add to the collection is not activated , when opening one piece the temporary collection is activated and activated . this collection will then be added to the opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on removing . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs can be played . if you select the row according to the sub@@ menu of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add or remove songs or choose random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selective list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to further jump a song , select the &quot; &quot; nearest song &quot; , &quot; the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song back , select the button previous piece , the entry previous piece from the menu item or press the button arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection there and click on the button Clear . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter since they are not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers who are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI @-@ events translated into events that understands the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map , which conver@@ ts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and can thus always be a trumpet , if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound card , you do not need a MIDI map , because all sound@@ cards are GM -@@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and CIS ) , FM radio devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI Maps . so you have to edit the appropriate file from hand ( using your favorite editor ) . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI @-@ map is a text file , which stores all required compositions to play a piece . &quot;
&quot; each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section which may appear as often as desired . however , is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further key@@ map ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D Options ...
&quot; you see that De@@ fine used to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of an interface is reached . &quot;
please send me your Map file as e @-@ mail so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be used for devices that are not general MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section the patches are shown as the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
&quot; please note that the lef@@ tist side of the equ@@ als sign is ignored . it is believed that the GM patches in the correct order will be available ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also have no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all notes that this instrument need to put on the tone with the number M ( e.g. with Ton 60 ) , which may be similar to a gun . to this end , enter the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so when a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( barrel signal ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is available in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant , with which every sound represents a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ er instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , Mar@@ acas / etc . ) and not the one in which the tone represents the clay @-@ height of the same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section will be used to indicate how sounds are shown on a particular channel or instrument .
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of the lines is very important as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are used mainly to form tones on the per@@ k@@ ame channel . look at the given key@@ maps as an example .
&quot; this section can be used to switch some channels to others . if you want to s@@ wap the first and second channel , simply make it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have the perc@@ ussion on a specific channel ( general MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following patterns : &quot;
&quot; n this channel is the channel , which is displayed on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map will naturally be defined in the file . if you use the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case it will always be patch . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example to always use the per@@ k@@ ame patch on the per@@ k@@ ame channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der Rati@@ o is multiplied , in which relationship Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der @-@ events is multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , this is used with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only conve@@ yed . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that there is no dec@@ imal number in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM gives you a key@@ board , which is a pitch @-@ rate event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , try to find some key@@ boards by two notes up to an oc@@ tave . to try the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . you will find this in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
the can@@ al@@ view is a window with a whole range of pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ anos you see which sounds are currently playing .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument , lights up the button no longer green but red , to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to view the played notes . view in the menu settings under the point edge view : settings
&quot; the speed @-@ LCD shows the speed , with which a song is played down . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . so if you find e.g. a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . with this , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; well , I can force anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control of everything . &quot;
&quot; this may happen if you have compiled a binary distribution ( r@@ pm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we support , you need to download a source distribution ( for example from C@@ mid ; &apos;s Home ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; just agree &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
&quot; before , activate the setting of automatic add to the collection . otherwise , the files to temporary collection are added . &quot;
you can click the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to re@@ viewing the standard speed you can double on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ ade ; -@@ space floor a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or le@@ ased ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or I want to play a file just to the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; drag and drag the file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
&quot; if you only want to listen to a file without having to add it to a collection , turn off the automatic add to the collection , and the new file will add to temporary collection to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. First you only want to play the first file . so you only want to adjust the default addition to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection includes exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
then you un@@ subscribe to play also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ates me , continue to &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; I was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I &apos;m not spending lots of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect myself a bit of time . as hob@@ bies I have programming , MIDI files , play music and prove phrases . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid , or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ kis@@ .@@ es &quot;

&quot; it is possible to split the prefer@@ ential connections among the menu book@@ marks but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , so you should use the category permanent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarch@@ ies . if you have an associated entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and playback starts with the clicked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do it if &amp; k@@ m@@ player / share / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / , you can choose the different files in the directory for ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category cli@@ cks , then select from the menu View and next arrangements will only be displayed the XML content of this part . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , the menu has to be selected from the menu of the same with playlist and either the editing mode selected , or another category will be selected . &quot;
any changes are lost when the processing mode leave or another group is selected without using the playlist .
&quot; due to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;

it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; the files will be ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ m@@ player / ex@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening a different source . this would be disturbing with the end @-@ animation however , the user can finish the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the view of a favourite photos : &amp; lt ; w@@ ls ; &amp; nbsp ; IM@@ G D@@ ur = &quot; in@@ quired = &quot; in@@ f / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; s / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / / sm@@ iles ; / / / / /
&quot; there is a rider on the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here , the path can be adjusted from the M@@ player and the intermediate storage size of the dat@@ ast@@ ro@@ ms from the network and other things . &quot;
another tool for de@@ bu@@ gging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this playback dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; all must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be added to the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module has to be specified as service provider for the m@@ ime type in / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the interior dialog file Reg@@ ulations of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is available in a consoles app and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser library . if no error occurs , the back@@ end issue is inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; this is always a pre@@ dict back@@ end for a certain m@@ ime type ( of course only if this has been identified ) , this has to be done by manual change the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c . for example , phon@@ on will be called phon@@ on all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards either using M@@ Player or X@@ video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be looked , the scanner is used to use the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Re@@ order ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player , the dialog in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port to be found ( e.g. , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
as the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ video ( presumably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is why the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server is necessary . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server it is necessary to contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
&quot; internally used by KM@@ players for the sources different names . at the time of the emergence of this documentation this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d source , external source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they begin with the play of the playlist . &quot;
are there evidence as I can do my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / CD@@ ROM is available as users root after stopping the device . this is absolutely sure to make sure that / dev / CD@@ ROM shows on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
X@@ ine only starts slowly but why should my CPU be tested to their performance each time ?
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ l@@ t. k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time will examine x@@ ine the CPU . &quot;

l@@ atex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be found on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; Tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
&quot; most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux system . for installation , documentation of the distribution and installation disc should be used . &quot;
the &amp; ki@@ le ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow a simple installation without further comp@@ iling and are on the ki@@ le ; web page included .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; l@@ atex ; , &amp; k@@ ills ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation must be taken into account . however , the support for this project or its documentation should be desired , should contact the ki@@ le ; web site . &quot;

&quot; as well as other indic@@ ative languages includes &amp; l@@ atex ; an introduction , with which the most common properties such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text files are specified with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { document } , and must be closed with the command \ \ &quot; { document } . &quot;
the quick entry @-@ level assistant of &amp; ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for the fast creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; the selection of the assistant ( menu ) provides some possibilities for the creation of the document . there are also some options to be done in the document .
&quot; documentation : this will be the type of document document : articles ( article ) , book &#91; article &#93; , book &#91; article &#93; , Articles ( DIN ) &#91; Cr@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; 49 &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; amer &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user . &quot;

new users do not have to worry about . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source text editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; ki@@ le ; however , it is estimated that any mathematical environment has not been closed . however , it is saved by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it is saved to you by the high@@ lighting time and time . &quot;
&quot; with automatic rein@@ forcement of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ Beg@@ in { command } ) by &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically creates a space line ( to input the text ) and the per@@ imeter line to the end of the command ( e.g. \ \ \ { command } ) . this function can be disabled by command ... La@@ Te@@ X commands . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; l@@ atex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most beautiful and subtle element ) :
&quot; in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by one mouse click on the respective . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be very helpful , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; -@@ viewer on the appropriate line in &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ source code . &quot;
&quot; a DV@@ I ; file contained a description of the format document and also other information such as the font type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; . there are many tools for viewing , conversion and printing of DV@@ I ; files for different systems and straight . &quot;
&quot; when using the racks , the elements of the DV@@ I ; -@@ file has been clicked with the editor and as soon as an element in the DV@@ I ; code text is clicked on a section in &amp; l@@ atex ; code text is clicked , the corresponding point in the DV@@ I ; -@@ viewer was attached . &quot;
Master document : this function is simplified when working with multiple files . with a Master document the work is simplified with other integrated .@@ tex files . when using a project a project @-@ wide Master document can be adjusted for project settings .
quick construction : the &amp; l@@ atex ; code text is compiled and the result will be automatically displayed ( if no error in the source code ) exists .
&quot; file storage : in this mode , the DV@@ I ; -@@ file in the free@@ way , and it is not a call by &amp; Ok@@ ular@@ line ; after the quick@@ ening process . &quot;
&quot; in view of the Edit tool@@ bar , the three gro@@ c@@ ines in the document are designed . the selection fields have been designed for the rapid breakdown of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The exec@@ utable &amp; l@@ atex ; commands for the sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the selection field is for example of articles such as tags , Fu@@ gue , etc . , or references . &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name for a section , one image or other element is created . &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a fixed name ( selection above a selection field ) .
&quot; when using quotation , a selection list with the literary entries will be displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; the author has good editors with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author can also be written in &amp; ki@@ le ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last selection field with the name of this will be used for definition of the font , for the main text , the Fu@@ Ã © notes etc . it is the following scrip@@ tions available to apply : &quot;
&quot; at the call of &amp; ki@@ le ; there are two choices available : 1 . the wizard for the creation of a new document , by selecting the document type and proof of the settings . 2 . the document may be written from reason to hand . &quot;
&quot; the brack@@ ets after the command \ \ \ document@@ aries contain the settings for the command . the settings &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; lays the font . if the fonts are not fixed at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the o@@ ad source code was entered , the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ source code will be compiled . the simplest way to this is the use of the building or making of a button @-@ cutting . &quot;
&quot; the code text must be saved in front of the comp@@ iling . &amp; ki@@ le ; for storage , the storage is automatically saved . &quot;
&quot; if the comp@@ iling of the document was missing , should be searched in the log according to errors . when using Quick @-@ construction should be started &amp; oc@@ ular ; this is not the case , should also be considered the protocol . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( engl@@ .@@ environment ) is a text that is dealt with different from the remaining document . for example , a report with the fonts will be treated in { environment } , \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ end } . the command \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } , \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ end } . &quot;
deliveries are only stored within the environment ( from \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } to \ \ end } . there is no resolution ( number ) for deliveries inside an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to enligh@@ tening the reading and usability of the document . for example , certain fonts , fat pressure , educational background , etc. are added either with the command \ \ , or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ Beg@@ in { emp@@ h } : this command is for the intensive pressure and is long as long as he is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a sentence can be described with \ \ up@@ h { word } .
\ \ &apos; quote : created a quotation in the document . the quote starts with \ \ Beg@@ in { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
&quot; after the background for writing the source text was shown with the &amp; l@@ atex ; accordingly , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; &quot;
&quot; once in the assistant a bit text was entered , some adjustments should be added to the better read@@ ability of the document . there@@ for , a quote , a few places in the li@@ posuction and light pressure and a poem are to be used to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , using editor view or Str@@ g E may be back to the editor ( with internal viewer ) . at an external viewer , its window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DV@@ I ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . &quot;
DV@@ I ; is a unique file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ apping ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF @-@ converting or computer screen . &quot;
for the print of a &amp; DV@@ I ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DV@@ I can be printed ( in the viewer ) ( provided the printer is correct ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DV@@ I ; file into other formats . once the DV@@ I ; file from the &amp; l@@ atex ; code text was created , the transformation can begin in wav@@ ed other formats using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the fores@@ try search allows the direct jump from the editor to the per@@ ched position within the DV@@ I ; file .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ binary files . there just must be used modern under settings Ki@@ le ... Tools B@@ auen .
&quot; to carry out the fores@@ try search , the mouse @-@ cursor is positioned in a line of the source text and should be clicked on anticip@@ ation search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DV@@ I ; -@@ viewer is then done . &quot;
with this function in &amp; oc@@ ular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; document the appropriate &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ document of &amp; ki@@ le ; sub@@ net ; in &amp; oc@@ ular ; as text editor ; as text editor ... Editor )
&quot; if the failure of fast building the &amp; DV@@ I ; -@@ viewers will not be able to present a bug . if a bug is available , this will be displayed in the log file or in the news window . &quot;
the protocol file lists the error source in the source code . the log file is always the line to appear in which the error appears . the log line will always appear on the error in the log line and &amp; ki@@ le ; jumps to the faul@@ ty line .
&quot; once upon the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template used for the document . the possibilities presented are : &quot;
&quot; in selecting an empty document , a document may be written either from scratch or the wizard for quick creation of a new document . further information can be included in the section . &quot;
&quot; users of &amp; l@@ atex ; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / l@@ atex ; file , or a new file must be created . &amp; ki@@ le ; a new template can create a new template using existing document and selecting a file template . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using file , some strings can be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or string code ) . these variables can be set in settings . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced : &quot;
&quot; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ C@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string will be replaced by entering the document class . typically , it will be used as follows : \ \ document@@ aries &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ C@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { item } . &quot;
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the basis of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created by the following steps :
&quot; when creating a new document , you can select your own template instead of default . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; l@@ atex ; files will be created . a simple way for creating a template , should be sought after one on the internet and the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; used &amp; K@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; K@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the ability of reading and high@@ lighting ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; K@@ ate ; can be done directly from &amp; ki@@ le ;
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and its possibilities to experience the manual should be used to boxes . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; start .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers a very practical &amp; l@@ atex ; command reference which can be called the help La@@ Te@@ X reference . you may find a useful description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; l@@ atex ; use can be used as well as their syn@@ tax .
&quot; a double @-@ click with penetr@@ ated Str@@ g button to acc@@ use the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way by clicking on \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ . \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; when pulling the text with penetr@@ ated lin@@ ker , the text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow buttons , the parts of the source text can be displayed in the editing window . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; has the ability to browse the most different kinds of source codes . for example the &amp; l@@ atex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ ae are highlighted by another color .
&quot; many assistants can be used . this is a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . this is also highlighted the jump to the smallest or last spr@@ ing@@ mark . thereby , this spr@@ ing@@ mark is highlighted , so that it is automatically displayed when the first input of a sign . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects of turning a program like &amp; ki@@ le ; even though &amp; K@@ ate ; important functions for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; important functions for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; important functions for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; special commands for their selection . under Edit selection , the following commands are included : &quot;
&quot; if a complete paragraph consists of ( group of lines , which included on both sides a blank lines ) . with a paragraph it is not included a text with all other text files ( like in other text files ) . the only bo@@ wed thing in &amp; ki@@ le ; is that the only bo@@ iling point is separated by two empty lines . &quot;
&quot; if the word is composed under the current curr@@ y position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also has &amp; l@@ atex ; commands with a scratch card ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; for reading a part of the document it can be removed from this first and by dr@@ itting the button de@@ f . &amp; K@@ ate ; provides with its own commands , for a faster result . under editing , the following commands may contain the following commands : &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le ; is contained in the description of mach@@ ining properties .
it has already been noted that environments play a central role in &amp; l@@ atex ; therefore offers &amp; ki@@ le ; for NF more commands under mach@@ ining environment for easy work with &amp; l@@ atex ; .
&quot; with this command , the start of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to be placed in the surroundings . &quot;
&quot; with this command , to end the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the end of the environment . &quot;
&quot; if the cursor is before or within the command \ \ Beg@@ in { surroundings } , becomes the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many disappeared , ambient commands may be quick to leave behind . this command slept the last run environment , so that the disgu@@ sting ambient structure is not included . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; l@@ atex ; groups that are determined by brack@@ ets { ... } are a few important commands that meet those from mach@@ ining environment .
with this command the current position is dri@@ lled ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the wel@@ ded cl@@ amps .
&quot; with this command , the end of the current group will be j@@ umped ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the wel@@ ded cl@@ amps . &quot;
if the cursor is in front of or behind the wel@@ ded cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # located at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering many disappeared , groups of brack@@ ets can be lost quickly , the recently fixed group , so that the disappeared structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups do not exist at once . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; l@@ atex ; will be used two simple instructions for example . for the purpose of purpose is used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; for two simple instructions , the sign &quot; uses &quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; &quot;
this automatic filing of double occupancy can be set up under settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X and can be activated .
can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and with this German or fran@@ chis@@ ee sign . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; at the edge of Shift ; input @-@ key for smart for@@ ef@@ its . if the current position is located within a list of lists ( e.g. en@@ um@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , for example , not only a sign of character , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; inside a tables environment , there are &amp; ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ , with an attached sign off . &quot;
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ presented &amp; l@@ atex ; - or user @-@ defined environments to be supported ; setup ... La@@ Te@@ X can be added .
&quot; some users share the columns in tables environments and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; ki@@ le ; try to con@@ fine it . while this t@@ ator isn &apos;t the per@@ ky , pl@@ ated &amp; ki@@ le ; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tab . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; K@@ ate ; already provides a good source code , this has been expanded in &amp; ki@@ le ; in order to have special commands ( mostly for needed &amp; l@@ atex ; ) are three to need and the other two are available for automatic contamination . all these modes can be set up under settings , ... &quot;
&quot; when entering a new environment by the command \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } , &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } to an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; while the cat@@ chy taste is removed , the last letter of input will be removed and , therefore , the list may also be reduced by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions can be collected by &amp; ki@@ le ; alternatively , jumping brands can be found , so that a simple jump to these positions by doing ank@@ ks N@@ Ã ¼ ste reference is possible and the selected parameters can be folded . &quot;
&quot; under settings , set up settings to be done on these lists . there can be different types of alarm lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; commands , as well as waf@@ ers of general language used . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is for analysis of environments not n@@ Ã ¼ ally . it is always used to be entered a few letters with \ \ Beg@@ in and the call of understanding mode is often used with ambient temperature . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for completion of the environment . &quot;
&quot; when calling the full @-@ use mode of Alt + Shift key , the command will be automatically integrated into the environment and it appears \ \ Beg@@ in { . after that , ambient temperature can be continued in the easiest way and through the input of the input table . &quot;
&quot; after this has been accomplished , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le ; recognizes that it is a list of lists , is even a first \ \ item command . &quot;
under settings ki@@ le ; set up ... ki@@ le ; filling settings to these lists are done . this mode uses the list of full @-@ payment mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; commands .
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of copies , which can instantly be replaced with settings , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl , in which example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L entered and the word processing mode is introduced , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; crude oil costs are not helpful for automatic contamination . however , it has been found that many mer@@ ges in a document will be written more than once . thus , it offers &amp; ki@@ le ; the completion for all already written names . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the menu item Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ ful@@ ler . here , the swelling value for the display can be defined . &quot;
&quot; the processing files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / etc / etc / / / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode ( subscription ) , Dic@@ tionary ( currency ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialog graphics are designed to create graphics as simple as possible . for the view of the basics of the graphics formats , the sections and attention should be observed . &quot;
&quot; PS -@@ files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for the analysis and re@@ arrangement of pages . the PDF output commands , so can the PDF output be arranged and then converted with p@@ s@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to pay attention to the results of work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the menus for comp@@ iling , create converting and creating view . &quot;
for the comp@@ iling of the source code for viewer such as &amp; oc@@ ular ; or the further transformation can be used the scanning spect@@ ator Alt ; 3 . afterwards the DV@@ I ; -@@ file can be converted into a PS file and by means of Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed .
&quot; when using the command quick @-@ building , a spect@@ ator is called after the comp@@ iling . should not be used to be built @-@ in viewer , every new window will become a new window . &quot;
a new project will be the project &apos;s new project .... here the following information for the project will be asked :
&quot; when wearing the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ ti@@ lep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; ki@@ le ; allows execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be managed in the en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed bar .
&quot; the API @-@ scripts are not yet finished , and can be found in further versions of &amp; ki@@ le ; &quot;
first of all must be said that the completion environment of the scripts in &amp; ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) with the following methods :
&amp; l@@ atex ; is a fairly common system which can be expanded through the basic functions by a variety of extra packages . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support the user .
&amp; Tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are delivered with many documents . this includes documentation for the included packages and a further &amp; l@@ atex ; reference .
&quot; a full refer@@ r@@ ence for &amp; tex ; and in addition to a description of all the programs ( but some important packages are described ) but rather , it is ideal for searching for a certain form@@ atting . since it is a very rough document , it will be divided into &amp; ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / lyrics live ; the Fin@@ der of the right document is not always easy . as a possible help , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / lyrics live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k which contained a database with all to &amp; ki@@ le ; available documents and for a graphical upper floor . &quot;
&quot; all documents are divided into categories , and the benefit of the package is the search for parcel name or stroke . then only the results are displayed . &quot;
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the bed of space is the viewer for the document .

output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files ; files are deleted every time if meant for pro@@ c .
&quot; as said before , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; there is now a great graphical interface for this . &quot;
&quot; if the selected file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , then it just let the current job @-@ folder . if not , then select up @-@ up @-@ to @-@ date work@@ folders and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is . &quot;
when it comes to a output on the screen your file is faul@@ ty . please check the errors and try again .
&quot; if the file testing is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ly , then the current file can simply be stopped . if not , remove the tick on current file and select the file using other file - file selection . &quot;

&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; do not have little to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; even if the plug @-@ ins will immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone gets the wish in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be found below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a K@@ part , we begin with the menu plug @-@ in . thus , the following dialog is open : &quot;
this dialog allows to manage all the plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search box . when adding to plug @-@ ins without a storage location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; this path to search of the plug @-@ in .
often working on a project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relation to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Ni@@ ck@@ name is the nickname of the user and serves for clear identification .
one member may have several roles in the project such as both team manager and sub@@ project leaders .
&quot; the user can search for yourself from the list of the team members who he is . this happens , by flag@@ ging the team member from the list and press the button as expresses . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ ties ) will be released after which you are : text . &quot;
nickname and the attitude of their own identity are important regarding news and comments . see for more information about notes .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team there is another advantage by recording the members of the team : it can be created an event to provide information to the team manager , if something is happening . see for more information . &quot;
&quot; event campaigns are actions that will be executed when something particular happens in the project . an example would be viewed as much someone processed , or sending a message when a file is secured , or a script that is added to the CVS as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; on the page of event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings , Di@@ alo@@ ges can be edited , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email will be sent to the addres@@ see of the addres@@ see list of the addres@@ see . the addres@@ see may be a team@@ - or sub@@ project manager . see in , we@@ i such leaders are set up . &quot;
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
&quot; to enter comments is simple . it can be selected either the note -@@ entry from the editor @-@ context menu , or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary area followed by default text . &quot;
notes can be sent to a decisive member of the team . in this case the syn@@ tax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation is the role played in the project out of the following possibilities : team@@ leader manager sub@@ project manager After the departments and sub@@ project names should be introduced in the following examples below .
&quot; nickname and roll names are independent of large or small , but spaces around the br@@ aces and the : make the note invali@@ d . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ atting languages that D@@ T@@ D @-@ diagnostic is and web@@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
&quot; the settings are accessible via the settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; -@@ specific settings are covered , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up through settings Qu@@ anta ... this dialogue extends over some pages that will be treated in succession .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; regarding tags including car complete can be changed . the entries are :
&quot; large / small case of tags : large / small box of automatic inser@@ tion tags . regular Groß / Klein@@ spelling means , the tags are as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / small case of attributes : large / small inspection of the added attributes . regular Groß / Klein@@ spelling means , the attributes are as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically include : if cancelled , is op@@ tionally available to tags for which the next day is optional , this immediately after the day . &quot;
&quot; not optional tags : as above for all other tags , except for simple tags . &quot;
&quot; start and finish @-@ day automatically update : when switched on , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic mapping of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of an acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding enco@@ ding during installation .
m@@ ime types : Mim@@ e@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . by means of default the default settings can be restored .
standard character enco@@ ding : enco@@ ding from newly created or used in other ways than using file opening files ( where the enco@@ ding of the file can be passed ) . but this attitude will be loaded from the same in the proj@@ ections if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ T@@ D is not recognized . however , this attitude will be released from the same in the proj@@ ections if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; created regular backup copies , so with a black@@ out or crash at the next start of the program you can restore the document from this backup . that &apos;s not the same as storing the file . even for not stored documents a backup is regularly created , according to the specified time . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing sector or in your own view ( or documentation in a mapping ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , the preview and the source code simultaneously . &quot;
set the window settings back to the default back next start is useful when the user interface comes through modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views across each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line .
the warning sheet section serves the taxes of the possibility to switch the ad &apos;s warnings by no more inquiries .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as synchron@@ ization of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in the shared mode . see the different modes see .
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the struc@@ turing tree , which depic@@ t the illustration of the par@@ ser @-@ no@@ des in the document to be set out in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse @-@ click on the structure tree , the following action causes it possible to change the action by clicking the structural tree with the mouse @-@ b@@ out action . &quot;
&quot; in the field of structural settings , the visibility of no@@ des can be opened automatically in the tree , the actu@@ alization of the tree at mach@@ ining and how deep when changing the structure tree can be opened automatically . empty knot@@ s are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such that no element has been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; the range of abbrevi@@ ation of abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s may be valid , it can be a valid group for PHP in which the abbrevi@@ ation abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; here , the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are K@@ part applications used by third @-@ capable application , most known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting one plug @-@ ins must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not located at a standard there such as $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
&quot; input : this information is given to the plugin at the start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; component in the &quot; &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; &quot; mode load : check if the plugin refused to use it . only read @-@ in @-@ K@@ parts usually refuse the store , if this option is not chosen . &quot;
&quot; check the plugin : is this activated , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; if the given information is correct . selecting the plugin for the moment it is not available , but it will be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; from version 3.3 , the error search was completely new . th@@ ief for the no longer needed built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set up , as well as the support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ Plugin was implemented , which allows different implement@@ ations about plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only a plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the button options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ Plugin selection field the specific settings can be changed .
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; user interface : &quot;
a view where the contents of surveillance variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view in which all the features , with display numbers and conditions are listed . usually , appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is displayed in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action will replace the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or it shares the plug @-@ in with , to debit requirements . this action will be triggered by default , if a project is opened , that has a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that it does not need to be respected . &quot;
the counterpart at de@@ bu@@ gger session Star@@ te the session . includes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the leaves to requirements .
send a HTTP request to the server by a debit request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to see the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the Debug@@ ger edition .
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to begin with the execution of the script and update information about the monitoring variables as well as the current line @-@ added line continuously . if this happens during the script , the execution will be continued before a debit request starts , the script starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; returns the de@@ bu@@ gger to begin with the execution of the script , without information on monitoring variables and the current pointer number . if this happens when a script is stopped , the execution starts before a request requirement begins , the execution starts as soon as a request is placed . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next statement in the script without entering the functions or includes .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next statement in the script , where possible in functions and includes error messages . &quot;
&quot; if the de@@ bu@@ gger indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger , to move the instruction and go to the next so there would be the current . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which shall be monitored . the over@@ awakened value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable entered or a new value of a variable can be set . &quot;
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keit@@ h Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front @-@ end and a K@@ part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g which they can find on htt@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many other works of Keit@@ h .
&quot; this chapter describes how you can and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; adapt to your needs and how you can and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , can be better . &quot;
&quot; document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; used to provide support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; to give &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , Family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s include two file types , the &amp; person p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and tag@@ XML files are included in a document ( above the Edi@@ tier window ) , the text and instructions faster into a document than a user ever could . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s may be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see in detail for conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; ther@@ eu@@ p@@ c ; and also tool . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Fe@@ atur@@ es@@ di@@ alo@@ ges that displays the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; themselves . tool make a quick inser@@ ting of tags in a document without any risk of writing .
&quot; day folder are nothing but a folder . they contain only the &amp; quot ; and the tag@@ XML files . day folder bear the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML file and de@@ kl@@ ists whether they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible , so that other users have better insight and more information at work with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes every element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations will be presented in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a tag@@ XML document . it can only happen once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it does not contain just one element type over yourself . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only family 2 )
only for the day @-@ type class is valid . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
&quot; only valid for Type Meth@@ od , giving the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 ) &quot;
&quot; if yes , the day has an adequate attribute and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
inser@@ ts a text into the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; D ; text &gt; -@@ tag is determined . this is an only element type of element .
&quot; describe an attribute of a tags . this element can only once exist for each attribute . additionally , there will be additional tags which describe how this attribute should be displayed &amp; etc . this is an only element element . &quot;
&quot; returns the source text used for the filling used for the attributes in the tag @-@ editor , and in the attribute tree &quot;
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; will be used for achieving the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p @-@ methodology within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; used to achieve the source of data .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting @-@ site and a methodology . the arguments that are passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container tag which group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can happen for an attribute description only once . it is a only element element .
sets the position of the attribute of a tags within a dialogue process . this day can occur for each attribute in a dialogue only once ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
&quot; returns the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in the dialog once , for example one for each &amp; D ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; day ) . this element is empty . &quot;
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is an only element type .
indicates a list of elements that finish a day . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : ? ? ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ co@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be neat and closed .
&quot; spaces affect nothing , but watch on &amp; &amp; he@@ els ; character . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; , &amp; nbsp ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; , will not cause a leg , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to verify the Tag@@ XML files , the tools is shown above in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; window to start and check @-@ tested tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialogue will be appearing , whose simple instructions will follow . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available . at present , the check follows only when charging the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . &quot;
&quot; in the following an example for a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the layout , scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; in the following an example for a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ co@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tags &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; status = &quot; &quot; optional &quot; &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; nbsp ; / day &gt; &quot;
the &amp; person p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ file is just as simple and there is an editor accessible via D@@ T@@ D Bear@@ be@@ ite D@@ T@@ D settings . for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created with following entries :
&quot; &#91; General &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; version &amp; D ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ T@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a nickname . &quot;
an action can be set with settings ... created . click on New Action leads to the same dialog :
&quot; this action wei@@ ghted keyboard short@@ cut . by clicking the button of the user , a keyboard short@@ cut can be assigned ; using K@@ one is the current short@@ cut short@@ cut . &quot;
the simplest actions . it can be entered a text in the deto@@ xi@@ ated settings and when carrying out the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can use external applications ( usually scripts ) , which will change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , are launched . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; themselves are the Schnell@@ start @-@ dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : S@@ H / home / my@@ home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ ting dir variable in the command line , as sh % scrip@@ ting folder : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / qu@@ anta / scripts / Scrip@@ ts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts . &quot;
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in the case of a local document file : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : is replaced with the P@@ ID of running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; only one instance is running the text will be used in the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; from the external script .
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script entry can be assigned from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; at the default input can be determined to send out what is to be sent to the standard input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the entry , the output of the carried out can also be diver@@ ted . there are two types of output written : normal output , written on the default output ; it can be specified using the text written on the default output . it can be specified by clicking the default output edition : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the market @-@ up language , it is recommended to create tags in logical groups . in any case , it is not too many , therefore one can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
complete all the required fields and add them to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete all and , if the day attributes , and you are planning to use it , enable dialogue &quot; to edit &quot; day when available , in order to enter the action is available . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? we replace it before we have difficulties .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , chart other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a laun@@ cher as a symbol . through the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as a symbol ) , or should at least , a message to the user may be sign@@ aled , that An@@ y this symbol A &amp; lt ; start@@ led ; -@@ tag in the current document will be extended . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it has to be connected with the action . this happens via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field there is a button , press him . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored symbol is , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the apply button and continue with other tags , so there are , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to supplement some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; -@@ functions to tool tool@@ bar or it should be used for better survey of some tr@@ den@@ omin@@ ator into multiple groups . open the tool set to set up dialogue on settings tool . make sure that the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
&quot; I want to choose the trac@@ er ( very left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element to be added to the tool@@ bar , you press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note how the separ@@ ator support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the Start button . &quot;
&quot; the new tool@@ bar must be tested by using all symbols , to make sure everything works . &quot;
&quot; when re @-@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the right folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust your &amp; amp p@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened from the corresponding type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the worth mentioning of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; for normal users is the possibility to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or form@@ atting language , which you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ly ; -@@ Re@@ pository , if anyone has done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ ative / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we leave you , the second we treat here . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc 1 = button , relative to this file , to the document@@ ations HTML files = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html 5 . 1 . 1 . 1 = 2.@@ 1.@@ html 2 = 2.@@ 1.@@ html 3 : 1 = html 2 . &quot;
&quot; the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see this in the &amp; PHP documentation : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc du = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 In@@ ference Star@@ ted = In@@ tro@@ duction , # Language Re@@ ference Table of Cont@@ ents = Basic tax , ... Basic tax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Re@@ ference . this indicates that there is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the chess lessons ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top of the Bau@@ man@@ view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; Fol@@ der is displayed ! ) .
&quot; spaces influence nothing , but watch on &amp; &amp; B ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; resource @-@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . &quot;
&quot; the stage section is the area of do@@ cr@@ c file that is to be displayed for the design of the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; s for context @-@ help the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of by Be@@ ist@@ ling separate context elements which should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
&quot; now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c and save to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you indicated in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c , and copy your HTML documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you are sure that these good and it is worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation uses the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; -@@ Re@@ pository for the use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; -@@ Re@@ pository for the use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best Web@@ Develop@@ er platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the waste resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ ing with promotions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or anyone else . at different places , there is an email to send menu item , such as D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; -@@ users are reviewed and only available , if our team takes them as correct and useless for publication . thus , the source of resources is ensured , both for our team and for the later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading you are asked for your private GP@@ G key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the event you have multiple keys , you can choose an out . in the dialogue of New resource you have to stay empty ) and clicking on OK the up@@ loading must be launched . &quot;
&quot; the upload can upload from the menus D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) to upload tool tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and script tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , even before installation , investig@@ ating &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signature . if the integrity is given and the resource is given correctly , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work with XML @-@ languages which is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; however , it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of day files are necessary in the tag@@ XML format . there is the easier way to convert a D@@ T@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
the conversion can be started from the D@@ T@@ D charging and Conver@@ ting of a D@@ T@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description which should be used . afterwards the following dialog appears :
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written using this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definition line : the string that in the ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE day , such as HTML Public - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 transitional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loo@@ se@@ .d@@ t@@ d shall appear
&quot; tuning the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; after conversion the &amp; person p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , there are some key concepts . to understand this and to make full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; this chapter tries to bring them precisely these concepts , without whose understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and proj@@ ec@@ ast . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; use , available . of tool@@ ing about actions is everything that is globally marked , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . this enables the group of administrators to secure tools , actions and patterns in the global tree , which then are available to each in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool make . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool make with special actions specifically for the files of a certain project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , making use of special tools and patterns of all staff within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editing window , the construction views , the car@@ ni@@ cs , with info and the tool @-@ tool . please suggest you , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the mapping with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document details , re@@ charging , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right click in the editor &apos;s area lead to another context menu regarding the processed document format ( cut / copy / paste / paste ) , processing of under the mouse @-@ cursor , or opening the file , when the string below the mouse cursor is called a file . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the Edi@@ tor &apos;s tool@@ bar , the tool@@ ing of the Edi@@ tors . currently takes &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 transitional tional as a standard , for which a set of tool can be displayed . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , the tool@@ la@@ vers are adapted to the new functions and associated users need to be adapted . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ ing is really easy . if they want to insert in their document , then click on the icon which one day represents , then you can insert the data for this straight one day ( as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the Bau@@ man@@ age@@ views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; to open and ro@@ am . in the presentation with car@@ ni@@ cs are available for files , project , model templates , documentation , attributes , and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . this view shows all the files in the project and allows the administr@@ ations of the files in the project by right mouse click . actions like add , removal , upload or del@@ eting the files from the storage media can be performed with the context menu . &quot;
&quot; another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template , pictures , programming parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all options open . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only for the appropriate users and templates in projects are only available in the project . more about templates is available . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can call the available information to a script . on the right mouse button , more functions can be available , such as the script to start , edit or send by e @-@ mail . &quot;
with this view one shows the internal structure of the active document . through left @-@ click of an element the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element . through right @-@ click of an element you will open a list of commands regarding navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
&quot; this tree will appear among the other parts of the tree . with it , you can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace . this allows the modification of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation to find web technology for your development . you can download un@@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and considered . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; two car@@ nival at the bottom of the window , can be achieved through the used information : the news window and the problem of problem . &quot;
this mapping displays information about each in Qu@@ anta current script . for example the D@@ T@@ D of the current document and all changes to the D@@ T@@ D will be displayed .

&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a Web @-@ development tool for the K@@ DE @-@ surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; was optimized for a fast web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; -@@ editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul began to deal with a close idea : what would be if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; an independent , exten@@ dable mark@@ up languages would be ? well , this would make him absolutely great@@ &apos;s most important web @-@ development tools for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer confined to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; now close to the path to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE may be . &quot;
&quot; well , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ esh ; Desig@@ ners is not only this possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; so to expand how they need it for their needs . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; allows Web@@ Develop@@ ers to boost the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can expand the productivity of almost every task . by the program comm@@ anding them &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . ( more about it can be found in . )
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web@@ development environment designed for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and was quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .

&quot; remove tool@@ bar from the visual range . it does not delete it from the hard disk . if you have not yet saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do this . &quot;
&quot; you can send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; -@@ Team , so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new e @-@ mail message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;

&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free licensed but as with any open source project the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; development in financial support they find here the way .
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled with the best from above down@@ wards , as for example after filling the project name the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author @-@ information fields can later be adjusted with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is automatically filled . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in small case letters and without spaces with the extension of web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can connect the server address of the machine to which you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ at@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected log will be used . depending on the setting of the remote machine , an adaptation could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates for the project will be saved . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files for various projects is used , this folder instead of the standard will be set . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the tool can be saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files for various projects is used , this folder instead of the standard will be set . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . there are multiple files or whole folder to be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change . with the script scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; let files leave if files , which are to be involved somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is started anew , not attacking . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main menu and you can make an exact selection of your own . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the files you want , or , by removing the tick , cling from the project . &quot;
&quot; the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can upload , in the menu with project project properties in the menu profiles , or with the short@@ cut Shift key ; F@@ 7 will be changed . &quot;
some settings correspond to those in the Project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder can be possible ) used in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; supple@@ mentary option to top , even files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ano are excluded from the project . &quot;
the projection view which is loaded with the opening of the project . it can be read more about proj@@ ec@@ views .
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only Gub@@ ed can be supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ Plugin can be adjusted with the button Options . in case the error search is described .
&quot; in the sub@@ window profile , upload profiles can be adjusted ( see in ) , as well as the display of a configuration for the content of the server for each profile , by drawing up an own component @-@ view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted , as well as a mailing list . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ window configuration you can switch event actions and add these actions , change or delete . events can be executed when a previously specific event occurs , such as the Si@@ ght of a file . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , open &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; the last project that was opened . this behavior cannot be influenced by this . &quot;
to open a different project please open the project ... from the menu project or the symbol project opening out of the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul becomes closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
&quot; the project gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project . &quot;
&quot; folders behave just as well , however the entries are missing and opening with ... in the right mouse button @-@ click menu @-@ menu : &quot;
here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information about the place of up@@ stream files . see .
&quot; allows removing the current profile . if only more a profile is present , the button will be distr@@ acted to prevent the removal . &quot;
&quot; the password will be kept in the core memory and will be forgotten by program@@ ing . this possibility is useful when common up@@ loading files is needed , and the rather non @-@ secure password on the plate will not be stored in question . &quot;
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion in front of the up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , many high@@ lands profiles have been created and therefore the project ( or parts of the project ) are up@@ loaded to different servers . in editing or creating a profile this dialog is displayed : &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the server , to which the files will be copied , either a fully qualified domain name or IP address . &quot;
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO Sl@@ aves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . usually , this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them at your discretion . the password is stored on the plate , so it can &apos;t be easily read , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily be seen in the plain text . &quot;
&quot; a projection view is only a set of files and tool . it can be used in a project many views , i.e. using simple di@@ ver of view , various files and tool can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool . &quot;
&quot; views can be opened in the menu project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool@@ ing project tool@@ bar , will be opened or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; with whom you have the most to do . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; to its own way of working . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , tool make in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; best to make use of the menu tool@@ bar . use and add @-@ in . adding tool@@ ing is handled below in the section Add @-@ tool . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar and symbols can be adjusted either via the context menu ( right click on tool@@ bar ) , using tool@@ bar , tool@@ bar can be implemented or tool@@ bar , which can be specified in the dialog where the actions on this or other tool@@ bar should be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , in addition the entries will remove action and display action that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool set and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool ... and setting settings .
&quot; templates are basically used as a common fil@@ ette , code Schn@@ itz@@ el and files as well as an experienced fil@@ esystem with expanded organization and interfaces . you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any part in the system existing folder in the pre@@ book tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; in about the restrictions you imagine for the fil@@ esystem . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the terms used at the beginning of each submission .
&quot; bin@@ der is all that is not pure text . it can be added any file except text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in rout@@ ing tree under global templates . further information about the Templ@@ ates tree is available . &quot;
&quot; based on these templates , new documents can be created by any text document . you can find simple rum@@ ors for the purpose and organising the work in appropriate ways to be efficient . see in for more information about the templates tree . &quot;
this type of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted based on a template but the same text area is always included in the documents . you can find everything from a comment over a final note up to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl base . some examples can be found in the box tree under global templates . see in for more information about the templates tree .
&quot; as the name says , these templates for whole websites serve as templates . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a zi@@ pped tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . &quot;
&quot; design a document structure after exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and choose File As a template save as a local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the pad@@ dy tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click on File As a template , save the selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be dra@@ gged with pulling and attach to the configuration templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be used in a previous folder , so you can use all file management functions , such as pulling and dra@@ fting or inser@@ ting over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder in the file tree or in the project files , select a name for the template and secure it . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ er lines or link dynam@@ ically to &amp; PHP ; in addition , some things can be combined with using templates in projects very profound . &quot;
the basic structure structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files put in the $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / qu@@ anta and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates /
&quot; to set the behavior of a folder , click on the folder and select in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is distr@@ acted as soon as El@@ ter@@ ous attributes have been hal@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and adapted to everything except the regular folders . if a regular folder would fundamentally dis@@ abling it , unless it would appear explicitly in the case of a normal folder , b@@ lah would appear with something like text @-@ stone . if nothing appears , you will probably be in a regular folder . &quot;
&quot; allowed , or requested text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the right head@@ lines / foot@@ er lines . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( point to show right mouse button ) about a complete file collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that are accessible via the menu View . the first mode replaces the code Editor into two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : he invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and cursor . then you can edit and switch to source code in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor in the source code are visible .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document that includes &amp; PHP ; it &apos;s not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; text code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; text editor . to edit &amp; PHP , the source code is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time changes both in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor are visible and the cursor in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor sync is already active , this mode is already active , the button ru@@ ck the active cursor from one window to the other , whereby the position in the document will be retained . &quot;
the synchron@@ ization state between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source code is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta . after choice of V@@ PL ; view one can choose between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in principle the recommendation can be adjusted in addition to the time of time . basically the recommendation : a small span@@ iel for quick calcul@@ ator and a great br@@ ne for slow .
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , such is tools to select document properties . thus , the processing of invisible tags in the work with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor is also called , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor will be created . this is used to change the suspension of the body code . thus , you can change the following : &quot;
met@@ a tags permit to store information about the document itself as key words for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click in the list allows the change of content , e.g. key@@ word on the column name and key@@ word key@@ word on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list or delete . a change about the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
&quot; it is possible to bind an external CSS @-@ style condition by pressing to the file @-@ open button , and select the appropriate file . &quot;
&quot; the use of the C@@ urs@@ ors is like in a text processing , due to with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor is unique . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted through sub@@ type and can be deleted via back@@ bone or starter . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ ting of tags is done in the same way via tool editor , as in the source text editor . it is to note that the inser@@ ting of tags already previously identical tags is not removed , e.g. if an anchor day , surrounded with text , everyone needs to be removed anchor day . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ ing such as the tables assistant or the lists of lists are disabled . you will later run in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists do not have to be used . &quot;
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for examining Stil@@ vor@@ es. in contrast to other programs for Stil@@ vor@@ es. it is possible to search for specific elements and the execution of the style can be traced .
&quot; to successfully compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; do not need to compile except &amp; k@@ esh ; nor the libraries li@@ b@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ bex@@ s@@ lt and li@@ b@@ x@@ ml , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ esh . &quot;

so there are lots of graphic tools for the same . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the compilation was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made a lot of changes and at the same time had changed a lot of text at the same time . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts in the same file .
&quot; the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly was changed inside these lines . and there was no evidence on the places where perhaps just the rec@@ ir@@ ation had changed . this change was a small nightmare . &quot;
so that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could show differences within a line and changes to white signs . later a lot of other useful features have been added .
&quot; if you want to compare the text for example , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparative window . &quot;
&quot; a function that made a lot of work was the comparisons , and merge from folders . this function changed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full @-@ full file browser . &quot;
also 3 @-@ way together is fully supported . this is useful when two persons operate independently of one piece of co@@ de and make modifications . the original file ( the base ) helps to solve the correct modifications . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the scre@@ enshot shows three Qu@@ ell files in combination with :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the same and merge complete folder . this scre@@ enshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences , and showed up the possibilities of today &apos;s colour monitors . if you often have to check co@@ de , you will like this function . &quot;
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are visible are visible . if the lines differ only in a certain number of white signs you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no trouble passing if someone else is changing . )
&quot; when a file is equal , and the other is different in a row , then the color indicate which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all the files are the same name , but in different folders , you can ease the Ti@@ p@@ par@@ work by writing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder , 1 folder 2 folder : 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder ... &quot;
&quot; open dialog permits the manual type of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting from the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting an last opened file from the list . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of differences with two files will be performed . &quot;
&quot; via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the comparisons will be introduced , for B and C , however , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if together , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to set an output file immediately . you can also get this step later when saving . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ tion button opens a dialog with settings . here , you can set options before starting with the comparisons . &quot;
&quot; sometimes one does not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to choose text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board in the active comparison window . the comparison begins immediately . in opening @-@ dialog you will have to select no files , you can simply close the dialog with the break button . &quot;
you can also drag and paste : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
&quot; which thought is behind it ? sometimes , a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar to these functions , it would be a relatively large effort . you would have to simply download two appropriate files , put them into &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; now you can easily copy the relevant sections , and then compare . &quot;
note : currently you can draw nothing out &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the case of text in a comparison window is supported .
&quot; warning : some editors interpret the pulling and dra@@ fting text into another program than cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost . &quot;
&quot; in the upper part of each text box is the info line . the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the pointer number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ ach Info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest a while on the line . then a small relief window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are assigned the letter A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed through the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , one sees the color , which file differs . if both files differ , the pre@@ defined color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( leading ) well . &quot;
&quot; left next to the text you find the summary column . if differences were found , the column shows the appropriate color . in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to only see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. are white signs only in strings and comments , for the pre@@ essor and in few , rare items . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the contrac@@ tion column from the text , is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the pointer is enabled , the line will be dot@@ ted on broken lines . &quot;
&quot; result window ( among the comparison windows ) has also an info line with the wording of output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; change &#93; if you have finished the result already text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
&quot; ! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , the store is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons jump to the most popul@@ ate / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two compar@@ ators are used , each difference must also be resolved at the same time a conflict of manually . &quot;
by clicking on the left mouse button in one of the windows the group is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this will also be a jump to the position inside the windows where the top of the group is otherwise highlighted . ) This group is highlighted the current group . it will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and the left appears a black beam .
&quot; sometimes , by automatic merge or by manual editing no more line is left in the group ; then it is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you change your mind and perhaps again select another source . this text appears either in the final stored file , nor in a marking that you may need to copy and paste it differently . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; summar@@ ised conflicts ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . go careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : if you select the sources the options include or ignore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also dealt with as white signs . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ating is mainly used with the portrait and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are used in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , bottom , o@@ g @-@ beginning and str@@ g end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . the Over@@ view column next to the vertical image bar can also be used to navigate . &quot;
&quot; in the Aug@@ l window , you can also use the other keys to edit . using the insert button , you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ writing mode . ( default is the default mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ ised columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the top of the respective group ( as already in the section ) and the edi@@ table display window was explained ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons on navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l image ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l image ) or to the next / previous conflict - all not automatically resolved conflicts also after the manual . therefore , must be distinguished between the solved and un@@ resolved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the markings to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button . if this is activated , whatever you mark , automatically to the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual copying falls . be careful with this option however careful , because you could be accidentally covered the content of the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; hands are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a pointer sign \ , and Win@@ 32 @-@ based systems use car @-@ line \ \ \ \ \ \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 reserves the drawing end files \ \ \ \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 keeps the hands @-@ end files \ \ \ \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 keeps use of the source files ; therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with binary files . &quot;
the options and the list of the last used files will be automatically saved and restored at the next start . ( menu Un@@ used - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ an script . if the chosen font does not support this representation , nothing will happen . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be ast@@ ered . on these systems the button pres@@ ets will automatically be an odd color . &quot;
&quot; if this option is activated , when pressing the t@@ ator button will be inserted the appropriate number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator character will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you input or return , the entry of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . manually copy the manual to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; you can select which pointer type you prefer to save , the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system . &quot;
&quot; with the same of files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in source files . only during this first step , white signs can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es white signs . in this step white signs will not be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a wagon mark &apos; \ &apos; . usually , if they are different . if this option is enabled , cars are dealt with different sizes , however , like a white sign , this option must be disabled . during the default this option must be disabled . in the default this option is disabled . &quot;
&quot; in the default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis the figures and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are shown nevertheless , but they are treated like white signs . &quot;
in the default this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white signs .
intensive search for even smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective with complicated and large files but slowly at very large files .
&quot; in the automatic @-@ rout@@ ing mode , this attitude determines how long the result of the selection is displayed , before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ sol@@ ves automatic all conflicts in white signs by using the chosen file as a source . ( pre@@ adjusted is manual selection . ) That if you need this only from time to time , then use better the functions constitu@@ ent A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the composite menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing or ignore C / C + + comments . &quot;
these options are dealt with in the chapter to scan and run a compilation . look for details under documentation to the directory comparison and inter@@ viewing .
&quot; when a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version is displayed the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a back@@ up@@ file exists with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; changing this option does not fit the current program . you need to end &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is set in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because language is set global via the control centre . ) &quot;
&quot; the following enco@@ ding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; about the selection fields for enco@@ ding appears a brief reference , which is the local co@@ ding . ( this can not be changed here and has for you purely informal nature . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the enco@@ ding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and merged with different enco@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; when you have edited a file , you can specify here which enco@@ ding should be used to save . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing command , it could not work with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the processing command can only be done with 8 @-@ bit AS@@ C@@ II . ) With this option one can specify the co@@ ding of the output of pre @-@ processing command . &quot;
turn this off to sup@@ press the high@@ lighting of changes in white signs in the text or review too . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing or ignore C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a colour @-@ per@@ ple@@ xed column . but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files ; -@@ gt ; B , A &amp; B &amp; D ; -@@ C ; C or B &amp; B ; -@@ C ; C is displayed in addition to the normal still a second over@@ pass column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you want to use the space available on the screen for long lines . bl@@ ends simply the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
assign the comparison window to each other . this can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is found in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide suddenly to merge the files together . one simple click launches the compilation and uses the fil@@ en@@ ames of the last source file as pre@@ set names for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the file , then the name of the last used file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will be handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that exactly matches your needs . you can also use this function for example to cut disrup@@ tive parts or to correct the rec@@ tification . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is transferred first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only in the pointer type . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that exactly matches your needs . each entry line needs to have an associated output line . &quot;
&quot; the thought behind it is to enable the user more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users would not want to program it yourself . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l perfectly sufficient . &quot;
&quot; use this pre @-@ processing command for po@@ len@@ ders to convert the input into large letters : sed &apos; s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ . \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ . \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; CVS and other version control systems use some key words to automatically create string chains ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word Sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ key@@ word \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \ \ _ BAR \ \
&quot; while you &apos;re experimenting with sed , you might begin to understand it and maybe you like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the Ign@@ ore of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for po@@ len@@ ders . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform multiple records at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like e.g. per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switches &apos; aller@@ dings are different in per@@ l some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) need per@@ l only ( and ) without the &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
&quot; the data after normal pre@@ essor are maintained for viewing and to merge . further operations only change data , which sees the line @-@ like al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre @-@ processor , the pointer instrument processor sees the output of the normal pre @-@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you may notice certain differences not notice and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively compare and merge . &quot;
... makes a suggestion for each object ; you can adjust the proposal from the start ;
... &quot; can simul@@ ate , simul@@ ate and shows the simul@@ ated changes without it really perform , &quot;
&quot; selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is similar to the link and merge from individual files very similar . you will only have to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; when three folders are merged , then folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder was specified , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not bring together . to start the merge , you need to select the appropriate menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; during reading the folder you will inform a small news window about the current progress . if you break the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to that time . &quot;
&quot; when the scan of the folder is complete , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left @-@ hand side ... &quot;
&quot; each file and any folder that has been found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the item or by clicking the arrow buttons on the left / right . the folder menu features two functions all sub @-@ directories and cap@@ tures all sub@@ directories with which you can catch all the folders and folders .
&quot; double @-@ click on a file , the file will start immediately and it appears a comparison window . &quot;
the icon in column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folder , then it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail@@ ing window to the selected object . in such a case the contrac@@ tion event will not be automatically selected . if that will start , you will be informed about problems of this type . &quot;
&quot; as seen in the above picture , the columns A / B / C are used in red , green , yellow , and black . &quot;
&quot; however , the color is identical as well , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
folder are considered as identical if its total content is identical . then you have the same color . at folders the age is irrelevant for its color .
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ t@@ ff . the colors reflect the colours of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow is and later when it is old . &quot;
&quot; a and C identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same type type ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , it cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B does not have the same type type ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , it cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode to sync is active , if only two folders and no explicit target file have been specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so the both folder are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : bring together and save the result into two folders . ( the user sees as visible file name for the output file only B ; directly after the merge copies &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; when two folders are assembled and the option of new file is enabled , then examines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. As long such errors are not removed , the folder can not be started . &quot;
&quot; during the merge one file will work after the other . you place status column shows skills , and according to other messages , if something is expected , you should make a final review and check whether the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if in the furniture dialog , the file @-@ method of full @-@ permanent analysis is selected , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , sol@@ dered , not white , and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ dered conflicts will only appear when three folders compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either bring the straight selected entry ( File or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the contrac@@ tion actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can bring it together . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have not specified a target folder , then in three @-@ folder mode C as a destination , B @-@ folder will be selected as the target and used when sync is A and / or B as the destination . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries should be displayed in the folder structure . there are several options to be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . check out these options to avoid irregular surprises : &quot;
to bring all entries together : select directories in the directory or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) to only select the current entry : select action of the current item or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if through conflic@@ ting data types still exists invali@@ d actions , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options passing , simul@@ ate and break down . &quot;
&quot; choose Sim@@ ulate if you would like to see what would happen , without the really changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a composite window opens ( note the scre@@ enshot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , select again directory together / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialogue appears . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry continues . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; at the end of the list , you will find a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select another action , or solve the problem in other ways before proceeding with the problem . &quot;
&quot; if some entries were individually assembled , you can notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and often lead them together at the later session . even if the data merge together or not saved , these entries are considered to be done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will again be combined . &quot;
the settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called Directory @-@ compilation with these options :
only files that fit into the specified pattern are shown in the Element@@ tree . separate the patterns entered with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid space : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . you do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the Element@@ tree ; it can be used more than one pattern ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ et is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the Element@@ tree ; it can be used more than one pattern ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ et is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files which would also be ignored by CVS . many autonomous files are ignored by CVS . the great advantage is that this folder can be adjusted with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ age file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems files have a reference attribute . in other fil@@ esystem . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the Element@@ tree or not . this option is enabled in the default .
&quot; when links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links indicate . this is disabled in the default . &quot;
&quot; when links to the folder : if the option is switched off , the links will be compared and recur@@ sively searched out . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not included on possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder of a link to itself contains to a final release and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; cras@@ hes down . ) This option is switched off in the default . &quot;
&quot; performs a full analysis of each file through and displays statistics columns . ( the number of sol@@ dered , un@@ attended , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and substantially slower when applied to files which does not contain any text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern ) . &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folder via a slow network , it may be quick to compare only the change date and the file size . however , this speed part costs you a certain level of security . please note with caution . this option is switched off in the default . &quot;
&quot; similarly as confidential the date of change , there is no real comparison . the files will be considered as identical when copying the change of change . please note with caution . this option is switched off in the default . &quot;
&quot; activated the sync mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified . in this mode , the proposals are selected to merge together . also the results are stored by files in both folders . this option is switched off in the default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , as it is assumed the knowledge that the other file is not also changed . you should consider this in any case . ) This option is switched off in the default . &quot;
&quot; when a file or folder is replaced or deleted , the original version is ren@@ amed or deleted . if an old backup file has already been deleted . if an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , this is also associated with normal files , not only the merge whole folder . this option is switched on in the default . &quot;
&quot; usually , the folder view will usually stay visible , you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the window list and text window divide main window in the window menu and switch between folder and text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file just using double @-@ click . nevertheless , you can also merge a single file directly without the folder . once you store the result , the status is set to be done and the file will not run once again if you start the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost if you want to read the directory again : list menu : new to read &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO @-@ slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders for opening up on local or remote machines . &quot;
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syn@@ tax as local files and folders . some things should be considered :
&quot; a path can be relatively un@@ und@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ hed . ( # - &gt; % 23 , whit@@ el@@ - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it can not be distinguished , whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file is adopted as a link purpose . ( FTP : FTP , S@@ FTP : ) . &quot;
there is no possibility to edit per@@ missions or change of change . therefore , the per@@ missions or change from the original date . ( please note the option confidential the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files ) . &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of the purpose is currently as difference viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts first ever the built @-@ in differences . to start K@@ De@@ 3 , you press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ De@@ 3@@ Part display from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; usually needed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is applied as a K@@ part , &quot; &quot; takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch has to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . moreover , this is un@@ reliable , if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the link of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . that merge or the same of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now He@@ ist &apos;s comp@@ are ) is already there . moreover , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can bring together as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I &apos;ve learned GPL @-@ programs for a long time and have learned a lot by watching the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or so go .
you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script probably not communicated the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the pres@@ et installed configure in / usr / local but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more detailed information on this topic .
&quot; if only the number of white signs is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; but if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line is considered not identical . if the lines is next to each other , this zo@@ is , but this is the case in the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor remembers every difference in the files where it begins and where it ends . however , this important information is lost , however , if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is much effort to design extra a new file format that could store this information . &quot;
the effort for this was too big until now . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to process large amounts of text should be used to use another editor .
&quot; after removing text is suddenly lt , no sr@@ c lin@@ t ; appeared and the text cannot delete . what does that mean and how can that be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to generate differences . even more high@@ lighting would be confusing and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; take advantage of , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or new . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to compile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ esh ; compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system , in which K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . however , difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of it . &quot;
cut ( str@@ g @-@ X or switching removal ) copied into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the marked text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Um@@ br@@ alt @-@ Past@@ ing ) adds the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current board position and replaces the current marking .
&quot; differences : files that are identical in all folders appear not in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; it will only appear entries to show the differences . this also results that identical files are not already stored in the target folder . if the target folder does not already contain the target folder . if the target folder will not be copied into the target folder . ( the behavior will probably change in a later program version ) , this option is switched off in the default version . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to choose from the source with let@@ tering A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are displayed out of the corresponding window to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) they are removed when clicking on the button accordingly . &quot;
&quot; in the default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white signs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ show of all virtual work surfaces . it is quite convenient to see the ongoing programs on working surfaces , change their size , stop or move it . this works both within a desktop @-@ surface and with several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual spaces , as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and can even be moved on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and other work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on : when on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the context menu has only shown the two entries P@@ ager ... and Be@@ end . if however , the symbol and the name of the application , as well as the entries are minim@@ ise , maximize , to desktop and filling . the commands effect the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . appears only when applied to an application .
&quot; sends the application to selected virtual desktop . appears only , when applied to an application . &quot;
&quot; if this cross @-@ box is marked , windows can be moved within the &amp; k@@ box ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work surfaces . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , you will be displayed in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual work surfaces displayed . &quot;
&quot; cross@@ roads this field lets the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual desktop surfaces . it is indicated together with Name , the names containing Ord@@ inary pay , &amp; eg ; 1st floor space . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as a background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; &quot;
&quot; when this field is enabled , the current programs are displayed as a small window in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty spaces are displayed to enable them to choose from . &quot;
&quot; here , the view of the program window is chosen . simply shows simple spelling with the proportions of the program window . the window displays a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems . &quot;
&quot; here , the arrangement of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window determines : classic lets &amp; k@@ p@@ ager appear : in a 2x@@ n @-@ grid , all virtual spaces appear in a horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically in a vertical series , which is very well suited for the display lateral on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini@@ program in the control panel . it has the advantage that it can be altered in size , display windows as symbols or with its content , and it also runs out of the control panel . &quot;
right click within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and then select switch @-@ switch ... allows the dialog settings to appear .
&quot; at the moment , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ ag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as for example &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. If you do not have writing permission for the file , you have to register as a user root or register to your system administrator . in this file you need to register the key win@@ do@@ w@@ Transpar@@ ent@@ Mode and assign a value to this . possible values are : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base , you need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE basic packages . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ likes ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly enhanced by new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines . &quot;
&quot; if you want &amp; it may start ; launch a window as shown above . below , this window displays the enlarged area of the screen . below , this window will be displayed as a window window ... the picture , which is displayed in the magni@@ fier window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window . &quot;
&quot; in default , magni@@ fied &amp; k@@ likes ; the area around the mouse @-@ cursor such as a movable lo@@ upe . alternatively , you can create a select screen range in the magni@@ fier window ( selection window mode ) or the environment of the mouse cursor at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse cursor in the enlarged window is displayed , select the settings mouse @-@ cursor . please note that &amp; b ; currently not able to detect the form of mouse cursor . this is always the standard cot ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse @-@ cursor . &quot;
&quot; in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse cursor in the magni@@ fier window and keep the left mouse button pressed , so you can post@@ p@@ one the content of the magni@@ fier and post@@ p@@ one it . this also goes with the arrow buttons . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key , or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window . &quot;
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left @-@ hand corner of the selection will stand firm and only the lower right corner move .
&quot; you can send a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , to copy a file into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to add it later into other applications ) to turn the picture and much more . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click , as soon as the mouse cursor a while on the same spot . it is intended to help people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome ( repeti@@ tive imp@@ acting code syndrome ) and which each mouse click pains . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same spot . it is intended to help people who are in repeti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mouse click pains . besides , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; can cause the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may suffer pain that are connected with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to clarify it once again , even if &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; pain can be avoided when clicking with the mouse , it is against pain caused by loading of the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can vary for everyone . &quot;
&quot; the use of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and guides a mouse @-@ click , as soon as you break the motion shortly . &quot;
&quot; if the intelligent shifting is activated , makes &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; take a break after it gets the pressing the mouse button . now you can move the pulling of the mouse button . in this way , you can run the pulling of the mouse button . this smart moving requires a little practice , but you get accustomed to it quickly . &quot;
&quot; this denial must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; one mouse @-@ click . &quot;
&quot; is intelligent moving switched on , the turning field will be switched ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; after the shut@@ down the mouse is waiting before the mouse button is left again , if there is no time due to the mouse . &quot;
&quot; now activated by clicking on the right and back , this function creates a slow Be@@ fore to the right and back , followed by a break , one click with right mouse button . a slow Be@@ fore to the left and back leads a double @-@ click . these movements will be started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the first time started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can shor@@ ten &amp; k@@ de ; to shor@@ ten the reaction times . open the &amp; monitor center , select sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der sound bu@@ ffer , which you set at a lower value to shor@@ ten the responses . &quot;
&quot; this option is marked , will be called &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; at any start of &amp; k@@ esh ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; please drag the particular documentation to rate , to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; sets all settings back on the values which were set at opening the dialog . have already pushed the button de@@ pressed , the settings are set to the stand after the last pressures . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; first with preferences . especially the intelligent move , you should start off at first . if you then click on the automatic mouse click , you can later increase the intelligent move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the responses of answers from &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains : the clicks on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window , which does not represent a link , does not take the mouse on such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse is spinning , you should clean@@ se your mouse . that is normally rather simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to remove the mouse ball . like this happens , from mouse to mouse differently . however , it should be very clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the so@@ iling may be easily with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; if in this case you use the intelligent moving , this means that &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the operation can no longer end with the slogan of the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; this happens when you use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; using another window manager , and move a window . &quot;
&quot; the solution to this problem is that you can execute yourself a mouse @-@ click . this is reset the status of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; and you can work as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; continue mouse clicks and puts the cursor to another point . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there , where you want to have it . but , do not park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you &apos;re looking for a but@@ ton@@ ing unit . safe zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool make and menus and the front lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent move , but I don &apos;t make it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you handle it . it is very well possible to copy it in the cli@@ p@@ board , to move it into the cli@@ p@@ board . however , there will likely be some issues to help you . here are some advice on this : &quot;
&quot; do not use the intelligent shifting , if you just start using &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; note the text rather follows : execute the switch button pressed while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and then click here the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; then use the audi@@ ble mouse @-@ click . thus , every time , when &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse @-@ click . thus , you can use the intelligent move even without the audi@@ ble mouse @-@ click . but this requires some practice . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; it must be installed the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Win@@ dow ; this should be the case on most of the system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble click is only available when the system has a sound card and loud@@ speaker .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; pressing the mouse button as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor in short . this program was developed for people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome and which the actu@@ ating of the keys are prepared .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; it can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling process , before the mouse button dra@@ gged down . in this way , the pulling and dra@@ fting can also be performed with the mouse . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with the mu@@ te users can let their computer speak for themselves . &quot;
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; mu@@ te users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list of course of course propositions which are to be discussed again .
&quot; on the first page of the assistant ( left scre@@ enshot ) enter the command a , which will later be used for voice @-@ overs of text . for more details , see the description of the furnishings . &quot;
&quot; on the second hand , select the default text @-@ password . from the text pass@@ codes you can often choose text passages , without having to type them . the text passages can naturally be processed . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right scre@@ enshot ) you determine the dictionary for the vocabulary . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can devi@@ ate the list of words with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly mod@@ elled words can be recorded into the vocabulary . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; it is clear and contains essentially an input field for the short@@ list of your propositions ( the lower white field in the scre@@ enshot ) and a publishing memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the scre@@ enshot ) .
&quot; when you have k@@ mouth ; properly , you can enter the propositions you want to hear in the input field , which you want to hear . each spoken proposition is attached to the viewer &apos;s memory . you can select from it sets which again should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu @-@ associated settings c@@ mouth ; set up the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog includes two mapping cards , voice @-@ overs and settings , the site vocabulary , as well as the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the selected language output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , you place the character enco@@ ding , with the text transmitted to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two kinds to pass the text on . select the cross @-@ box , if the text is to be passed on as default to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the cross @-@ plane is not selected , the text is shared as a parameter . you can use the following Plac@@ eholder : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command on voice @-@ overs depends on your language generator . this command can be found in documentation on your language generator . examples for this please refer to the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; as a language service you will use as a language service &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first attempt to provide the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the further settings on this page is available and which currently is developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the menu text pass@@ age@@ book or in the bar for text pass@@ codes . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of so@@ cks , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and added in addition to the shipping area . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage will initially only be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection field closing of the editing window for text pass@@ agen@@ das , you can specify whether the text @-@ password with the closing of the editing window will be automatically saved . &quot;
&quot; when selecting text pass@@ codes , the book will save the book . if you choose to make changes , the text password cannot be saved . choose before storing , will be saved and k@@ mouth ; ask if the text @-@ password is to be saved . &quot;
the page Wor@@ ter@@ supplement contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the vocabulary field . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field when this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection field you can currently use the dictionary to be used in vocabulary .
&quot; with buttons on the right , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of the books , or export it into a file . below the list , you can set up the names and the language in the input field . &quot;
&quot; select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; as ther@@ eu@@ pon , the frequency of single words will be determined simply by sc@@ aling the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the list of words with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , in order to just put right words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks , which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how it should be wei@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; with this option you place a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new specified words automatically add to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time . &quot;
the main area of the window to edit text pass@@ agen@@ tion@@ aries is tw@@ o@@ divided . in the upper part the text slides as a tree structure is shown .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding ke@@ ystro@@ kes . if you have selected a text password , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; actions like new text passages or books add or selected text passages and books , you can either reach via selecting in the menu bar , in tool@@ bar or via a folding menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text pass@@ agen@@ tion@@ aries or text passages , you can edit by pulling with the mouse to the new position or with the arrow buttons and the &amp; Alt ; key . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected ranges of the publisher . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected ranges of the publisher . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if text in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected propositions of the publisher . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is enabled , a ma@@ inst@@ able tool@@ bar is displayed for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is arranged by default via the editing window directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the sc@@ aled left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another position . &quot;
&quot; is this menu entry @-@ entry is enabled , a narrow le@@ dge in the lower part of the main window with hints on the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed when not tac@@ kled , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is enabled , a ma@@ inst@@ aller bar is displayed for text pass@@ codes with entries . the bar is regulated by default via the editing window right under the tool@@ bar . by mouse click on the sc@@ aled left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another point . &quot;
&quot; probably , you do not have the command to be correct or not completely entered . open up settings c@@ mouth ; set up the General Settings page and enter the command for voice @-@ overs on the output card . ( see tape dialog for Language Newspaper . ) &quot;
&quot; the festival is a language edition of the Edinburgh University . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh is supported . the license allows to use the festival for free and without any restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is believed that Festival in the folder / usr / local / festival is installed . the command to voice voice is then : &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a in &amp; Java . currently , it supports the English language generator . currently , he only supports the English language . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without any restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et@@ ts . the voice @-@ edition is then possible with one of the three following command : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option is to be switched on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the use of Free@@ T@@ TS ) . &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ gs to a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ery , so you need an additional program to use the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to collect the last character of the text so that an extra character must be added . the full command is therefore more elaborate than in other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / tmp / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ chi@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option is to send data as default .
the voice @-@ output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service available to all &amp; k@@ de ; applications are currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice @-@ overs systems .
&quot; as the setting of language generators is available only at the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as quickly as a language service as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; to adjust the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to succeed &amp; k@@ mouth ; successful , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ mouth ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; takes about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak to print the text by the computer . a list is already saved by the computer that the user can always release them again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language agent does not include . on the computer a language CV needs to be installed .

&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can use , you need to install program @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and set correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; for the first start of k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s or as long as no speakers are set up , the mapping tab will be displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the mapping card is also displayed . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that are different in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple variants for a synthes@@ izer . a so furnished combination of language , synthes@@ izer , voice , sex , volume and speed is called for speaker . you should at least use one present@@ er before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise , since the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise used the standard speakers . &quot;
various speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to multiple printers for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the hand@@ card present@@ er in k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr , the mapping tab will be displayed . it also appears automatically when you start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s and is still no speaker . &quot;
all already furnished speakers appear in this list . the favorite speakers appear above in the list . the top spokes@@ man is used for voice @-@ overs if an application does not exist .
&quot; just select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; just select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker down a line further down . the order of the speaker in the list is also determined by their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts system .
&quot; select a m@@ ele@@ b here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a Jun@@ gen@@ - and gir@@ dle to choose from . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the new speaker appears on the mapping speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the line menu , and check whether language output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled , so the T@@ TS service is taken by &amp; k@@ de ; see . now , you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; please click on the mapping orders to create text messages and to ad@@ minister . see . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up at least one speaker , you can set the language rout@@ ing system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the hand@@ card certificate to open this car@@ tei@@ card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; mark this cross @-@ box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts to activate the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this start is successful , the mapping orders will be displayed and you can preview text entries , and you can edit text messages and read the T@@ TS @-@ System of &amp; k@@ de ; disabled . &quot;
&quot; if k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s is termin@@ ated , runs and kt@@ ts ; on , if the field voice @-@ overs is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled . &quot;
&quot; if this cross @-@ box marks and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is automatically displayed in the system area of the control tool@@ bar , it disappears again once it is completed . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can start editing contracts , stop , stop and resume . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this row , you can preview the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board can be read or read a text file . you can also switch the speaker for a job . &quot;
&quot; apply on or OK , then all the changed settings are taken on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the mapping orders is only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD has been started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the P@@ TT@@ SD in a cross @-@ card and cross @-@ level directory ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; then you can read the text of the displayed web page . first , check the text that is to be read , and select the text menu item . after a short time the voice @-@ overs should start . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s almost always useful to highlight the desired text of a website . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML tags and other invisible trademarks are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; K@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text shown here . first , check the text that is to be read , and select the text button below . then the voice @-@ overs should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works when &amp; K@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta . &quot;
&quot; K@@ not@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ esh ; you can notify you of events , you can read the text of these messages even from &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; conversation ; to set up the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; for example , you can notify different types of messages . you can notify you when in an IR@@ C @-@ channel a message appears , in which your nickname is found . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
filter for string composition offer a good option in &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is a good example . you removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail and also the expression / local / In@@ box as this can be assumed in most cases as provided .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filters , text is dealt with , before going to program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unciation , to select wrong words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to deal with certain shortcomings of voice processors and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the issue of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it will be dra@@ fted on all other orders and holding these orders . if the output of the screen reader is pre @-@ read , the added orders will be continued again . &quot;
warning have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after the issue of warning .
&quot; news have the next highest priority . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application , the messages used . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a web site , can greet you with &amp; mouth ; aler@@ ts are also messages . read about it . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text messages . each order , which you encounter from the mapping orders is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a application that uses text messages . text messages are intended for output prolonged texts , which have no particular urgency . &quot;
&quot; all four orders are processed in queue , except the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders . if an application sends the output of a screen readers , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such pre@@ reads , this issue will be stopped and termin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders . you will be applied to regular warnings , messages and text messages as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filter Edit the text and enter it on the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filter are run as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
string inser@@ ts replace parts of a text by other text . the loc@@ ates parts can be delivered either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will provide using pre @-@ defined string profiles as : - ) by text or for the format of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understanding form possible .
&amp; XML ; ren@@ ders use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format into another format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML are included .
&quot; using inter@@ viewing @-@ filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program , sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . if you have submitted a female voice for instance , you can read text by K@@ DE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e. above . &quot;
&quot; each of these various filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a voice @-@ output . if the filter determines that its rules does not apply , he returns the text unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text assignment , a message , warning or a &amp; b ; notification of &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be sent , it is processed by all the activated filter , which were installed on the page below . the processing by the filters is carried out in the order from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the furnished normal filters . if a filter is not enabled , it is not activated and is not used . filter are processed in the row according to the bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filtering , and it will be shown below the following furniture . &quot;
&quot; for the setting of string filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a reference pattern . these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged against the associated replacement text . large and small case is not observed when compared . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filters . this name allows you to choose any number , it just needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string of character from the column . the list is shown in the sequence from top to bottom .
click here to move the marked word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can upload a list of words or regular expressions from a file to store or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries are displayed to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language registered here , the filter is used only if the speaker is sent one of the languages registered here . click on the button to show a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages , if you click the mouse @-@ click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button pressed . &quot;
&quot; here is a value registered , the filter is used only when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID @-@ based programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ bus ; numbers you have to pass away . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you can only enter copies . &quot;
&quot; the string of character filters is applied only to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box dialog box when consistent . all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of words , the character regul@@ ator filters used regul@@ ator in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by divi@@ ders ( space ) . &quot;
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regul@@ ator &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regul@@ ator &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; prin@@ t@@ out can be found in the package .
&amp; XML ; re@@ former translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such re@@ forming . it can only be installed on well @-@ shaped XML . the relief program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the ambient variable path is also sufficient x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; with the speaker op@@ tionally you can send texts to a certain speaker , which is set up to a certain speaker , or to an speaker with certain properties . you can specify , for example , that texts by k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before you submit a text to the filters , there is a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker properties which gives the program the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sending , and the properties of the speaker . with the speaker cable , you can write the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value registered , the filter is applied in case the text contains the regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regul@@ ator installed , you can access this by clicking on the button to get help from entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you define the properties of the desired speakers here . if the text has been filled the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected , the spokes@@ person is chosen to indicate the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to indicate the dialogue of speaker . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your speakers or to delete all settings .
speaker op@@ tionally will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ ed filter if applicable . you must fill at least one condition .
&quot; the voice @-@ overs API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with the programmers can lend their applications T@@ TS @-@ abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can use . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ bus ; interface between the voice @-@ output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the web site ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

&quot; here &apos;s the text of the text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc . &quot;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you give
&quot; open two &amp; console ; window . start rolling in one window , then c@@ tt@@ sm@@ s in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned language version supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Com@@ former@@ filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read . &quot;
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you must install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able at all works . you also have to do that if you do not use this voice to read by web sites . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and to be found via the ambient variable path .
&quot; certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters seem to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences is ski@@ pped or only che@@ er @-@ mar@@ vel . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure that the option character enco@@ ding is set to the correct language . there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string of character filters . see . &quot;

&quot; the program &quot; &quot; speech Disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; uses a adap@@ table module architecture for voice @-@ makers . if you want to expand it ; for the use of another synthes@@ iz@@ ers , please contact the developer team . &quot;
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for supporting SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filters is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; to compile &amp; kt@@ ts ; compile a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or new ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and development files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source text by &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source archive for k@@ de@@ fer , or have downloaded the target file for each night , and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , first check if speech disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your voice . this allows you to use the Sh@@ ell@@ tran@@ script SPD . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.@@ 4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; which is used to use the program disp@@ at@@ cher . the program k@@ tt@@ ms@@ gr is said to be further developed , that the establishment of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script SPD is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is dis@@ car@@ ded into individual phrases . the user can rec@@ tify , repeat the output , stop or break down . &quot;
&quot; if an application text is transferred to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have created an application for example , a female English speaker . if you have a speaker , whose language English and his sex is female , this is not the most suitable speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; one speaker choose , you see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the mapping button to add or click Edit on the list or click Edit , the mapping card present@@ er will display . as an example , the module of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown . details on the modules can be found under . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is contained in path , you only need to enter festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character enco@@ ding for text that is passed on to festival . at voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts are made . generally speaking , Western languages are ISO 8@@ 59 @-@ 1 , based languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ak , ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , you provide volume , intercom speed and pitch @-@ height of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ators and display this grey , the voice you chosen will not be displayed . &quot;
&quot; some voices like multi @-@ Sy@@ n votes will need to be loaded in order to load multiple seconds due to their size , these voices are already loaded faster at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( on larger memory consumption ) the first set is synthes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this cross @-@ plane cannot be selected , you have not added any speakers ( or forget to apply to apply ) . &quot;
&quot; if this junction box marks , the start of k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is visible in the system section . otherwise , after the start only the symbol k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this cross @-@ box is marked and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s still does not run , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD has to read a text . thus , you have the possibility to stop reading or control otherwise . &quot;
&quot; here are all the orders listed in queue , together with the application that has submitted the order , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the currently working sentence . the speaker ID matches the column ID on the mapping . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can count sat@@ 2 in the order that is selected in the list below , or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK all changes of settings ( also applied to the other car@@ h@@ cards ) and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s are res@@ ized to the symbol in the system section . then click on this symbol to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead Al@@ sa , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the mapping audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here , only text messages are listed and managed . expenses from Screen Re@@ a@@ ders , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information about the communication types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output . if a component can not be selected , it was compiled , or are compiled , either without support for the corresponding Audi@@ om@@ o@@ du@@ l or &amp; kt@@ ts ; it cannot load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de should be used for the audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you have to install at least one module . have you selected Al@@ sa , select the PC@@ M device here . see also &quot;
&quot; ask the intercom speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to roughly half and 200@@ nbsp ; % about the double normal speaker speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click to apply the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts system ; to take over the system .
the list of al@@ sa devices contains all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device functions with you . in doubt you choose standard .
&quot; on this list , you can set special promotions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language contracts : &quot;
&quot; the edition of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it will be dra@@ gged on all other orders and holding them orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the added orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after reading the warning .
&quot; news have the next priority . a message under@@ breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application that speaks news . if you &amp; eg ; just a long text to read on a website , you can welcome with &amp; mouth ; nevertheless someone who just enters the space . &quot;
&quot; will be interrupted a text order by a message , warning or the output of a screen readers , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio @-@ output into the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played out if a normal text contract is interrupted . if both introductory sound as well as introductory news are active , the introductory sound will be played in front of the introductory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this mapping are only valid for regular text messages . for messages , warnings and issues of screen readers there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ not@@ fy messages , start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr and click aler@@ ts . the lists noti@@ fications appear . &quot;
&quot; select this tool@@ box to switch the pre @-@ reading of &amp; k@@ ills ; if this adjustment is not marked , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; does not read any noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; if this attitude marks , the noti@@ fications in which a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not pre@@ read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or to delete it . if you click on the button Add , a dialog appears where you want to add the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message before , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone mentions your nickname in a IR@@ C message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which in the list is nothing else , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; use this selection field , to set what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event arrives . you have the following choices : &quot;
&quot; if you selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following Plac@@ eholder : &quot;
&quot; you can enter here the properties of the requested speaker . default , select the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the list of paper as the top entry . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . is specified for a certain event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action for all other events of particular application will be executed . as the last option comes the action to carry out which is specified under standard ( all other events ) . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . here you can specify the noti@@ fications as follows :
&quot; use the button Save to save the settings for noti@@ fications in a file . use the button shop to load stored settings from a file . if you want to begin with an empty list , click Dele@@ te . all entries except all dis@@ ks will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice @-@ overs , the speaker speed , the volume , the sex of voice and sound height . moreover , brands for the control of pron@@ unciation by for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following limitations are available :
&quot; you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , as this is the default voice , the festival used at the SS@@ ML edition . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration is not set to 100@@ * ; % is set , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ co@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F / Vo@@ is@@ .d@@ t@@ d &quot; &quot; Who has slept in my bed ? asked M@@ aire . who has slept in my bed ? asked the B@@ ären@@ kind . &#93; &#93; &gt; &quot;
&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filter and pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . SB@@ Ds have to start reading or stop using the first proposition , as only the first proposition must be synthes@@ ized or stop and break down , even if the language does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you see the pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as a pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter . you can change its settings , or add other pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter , but will get off from it . &quot;
&quot; in the easiest way , you will learn to sample the selection of speaker selection and give text to read . check on the mapping selection orders , which speakers &amp; kt@@ ts ; select how the choice of speaker changes . you must of course have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; and kt@@ ts ; then faster with the pre @-@ reading can begin , since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take very long time , &quot;
&quot; if you may stop or break down text orders on the mapping card , even if the language does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter is automatically set up , if you start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s for the first time . it cannot be switched off , unless you know what you do . &quot;
pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional and insert a tab@@ ular character ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the typing limits ( table characters ) are automatically removed from the text ) . notice that the standard pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter is to be included .
SB@@ D filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( k@@ ills ) , warnings , messages or the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed from the ordinary typing filter filter , you can insert this again by using the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file . &quot;
on the mapping selection menu you can write the speaker settings for the application . the mapping tab is displayed when
use of the default driver ( of the top on the mapping speakers ) . in other words : no speaker properties are defined .
&quot; using the appropriate speaker , which displays all the properties of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker . if you choose the settings of the speaker , elect &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise , choose &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker from , the most commonly asked properties . &quot;
&quot; choose the method to enter your desired spre@@ ader properties , by clicking on one of the selection button . &quot;
&quot; select the properties of the requested speaker . if this feature does not play a role , do not give anything . &quot;
&quot; mark this tool@@ box , if the property should take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several markings here . &quot;
&quot; as the language is a critical factor in understanding the output is dealt with , it is always considered to be a priority property . the only case where you possibly want to specify the attribute language , lies ahead if you know that a certain application text is sent in a different language than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the properties in the area spokes@@ man , who is most likely to delete , click the button @-@ button standard and then use on speakers , which is most likely to be listed below . &quot;
in this case 0 is available for the last word order in queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
&quot; k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr cras@@ hes immediately when it will start . I have compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I don &apos;t get any return . &quot;
&quot; G@@ stretching is cras@@ hed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; it was termin@@ ated . probably , you need to register G@@ ST register . at G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.@@ 8 . if the problem is not solved by G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.@@ 8 . if the problem is not resolved , you may try to update or un@@ install G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output over Al@@ sa does not work , when I play music simultaneously with another application . when I get a text order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; appears a message that says : to open PC@@ M . &quot;
on your system there is the problem that conflicts with al@@ sa occur that prevent an simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . instructions for possible solutions can be found on the website of the Al@@ sa project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
&quot; I have loaded an additional voice for the festival on the Internet . I installed it and I can use it in the festival , but none shows that voice . &quot;

&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , first check if your language version works correctly . follow the instructions that you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ izer , whose source code is open . the quality of voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . in many voices you can adjust volume , intercom speed and pitch @-@ height with &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . help in the instructions that are delivered with festival , you must first install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on disclosure . &quot;
this voice sets the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or new ahead . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ zip the software in the festival / lib / or / Russian / . if you set the Russian voices you must enter for the votes ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ ic ( 8 @-@ bit ) code such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
&quot; festival is normally included in the &amp; Linux , distri@@ butions too . therefore , you are first looking for the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the enco@@ ding must be adjusted to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use Russian voice , the enco@@ ding must be set to an 8 @-@ bit cy@@ ri@@ ll@@ ical such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer will take over the le@@ xi@@ al analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it creates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; votes can be downloaded by

&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; monitor center ; that enables the management of network interfaces , rout@@ ing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; monitor center ; allows the user to manage a set of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; monitor center ; can be called by selecting K menu on the monitor . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; monitor center ; create the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings at the &amp; monitor center ; it is displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting the net@@ work@@ station ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; will be started . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware do not install . physical devices and their drivers have to be installed and configured , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf : the device at all shows and allows the setting of network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed in installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and installed . network devices are added later , the driver must be loaded through adaptation of the following files , according to the core version , are loaded : &quot;
&quot; the module network is loaded , if the option network settings in &amp; k@@ monitor center ; -@@ index is selected . when starting the module network settings this , the platform used will be automatically recognized in the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be detected , the right selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which is best met with the distribution and the release of version . by flag@@ ging the setting non @-@ again requests the definition can be made permanently . at the next start of the network settings this selection will automatically be set . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is possible only in system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , what means , the settings can only be considered , the change is not possible . in the system administration mode you can click on the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders : &quot;
the rider network interfaces is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the rider network interfaces the following tasks can be performed :
the settings of the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the required device in the list and click on the button &apos; button &apos; and click on the dialog device .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button &quot; &quot; button &quot; &quot; displays the dialog with further opportunities . &quot;
&quot; with the selection automation , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched by a D@@ H@@ CP @-@ Server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are required for the system at the same time with the start of system services . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server is required . in the selection list you can choose D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the selection manual can be done without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP / TCP / IP configuration , the TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field network mask . &quot;
&quot; if this option marks , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface in the boats . if the initi@@ alization does not wish , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values listed in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched on , depending on the need . switching a network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .... &quot;
network devices can be activated or switched on @-@ off depending on the need . switch from an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
&quot; sets the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which conve@@ ys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ net networks . &quot;
&quot; if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface has to be chosen to the net , where the gateway board is selected . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine calls for htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNA trig@@ gers this name to an IP @-@ address like 12@@ 3,@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
the calcul@@ ator solution to the nam@@ esp@@ ouse part of the equ@@ est@@ rian nam@@ esp@@ ace allows an easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed wer@@ .@@ DNS entries can be inserted by selecting a listing and exec@@ utable in the list with the kno@@ bs up or down in the priority . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button &quot; &quot; button adding ... from the group machine to the nam@@ esp@@ ace can be added to a DNS server . it will be displayed in the dialog New Nam@@ eser@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; first , you must enter the IP @-@ address of the DNS server and then click the button adding . the entry will then be inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group computer to the nam@@ esp@@ ouse solution , select an entry and then click on the button Edit ... There will be the dialog Edit . &quot;
the list specifically known calcul@@ ator calcul@@ ates calcul@@ ator name @-@ to @-@ IP @-@ address for the TCP / IP sub system . it is used primarily when boats are used when no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks can replace it DNS server . &quot;
normally the list contains specifically known calcul@@ ators some entries which are &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this still in the test @-@ being version of IP should replace version 4 in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... The dialogue of New ali@@ as will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known computer and click the button Add . if the known machine has several Ali@@ as names , de button adding several times and enter the other ali@@ ases . &quot;
select an entry of a named computer from the list and select Edit ... The dialog to edit machines will be displayed .
&quot; it can be done with one of the following tasks , then by clicking on OK the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , needs to be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf : is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net to download the latest version of the source text .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly r@@ pm @-@ packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ ills ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply download the r@@ pm package and install in a &amp; console ; with r@@ pm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphi@@ cally surface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally , the development packages with libraries and other things are required . &quot;
&quot; this is only recommended by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to compile it . the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given ; in the second part , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf file will be discussed . &quot;
this area can not replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information on integrating the PC into a small ( home ) network is conve@@ yed .
&quot; currently , IP networks operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found a large spread . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is therefore currently concentrated on the spread IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in alien networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator the contact point , which may be used for a valid IP address , or if available , can D@@ H@@ CP can be used just as desired ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up a separate small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen for this purpose reserved to avoid IP address conflict with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded in the Internet , hence their use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet can be made possible for such machines by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
for smaller networks mostly addresses are used in the area of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is big enough for networks up to 250 computers .
&quot; in addition , the network mask are usually set at 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all the computers are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the default route is needed for the IP re@@ direction . &quot;
the AC address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . usually the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
&quot; in this part , the configuration files , which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in different distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file sometimes is dynam@@ ically changed at DSL @-@ connections , so it is not surprised if in case of active DSL links , there is another content to be defined there . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; is known that this file is random by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for belt drive based on tar . it offers the possibility to establish several archives on a tape . the first goal was to answer a question which my wife presented : how much longer takes it when you secure ?
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen in three ways : &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat ; add the band back and reads the pre @-@ voltage information of the belt . re@@ alizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ tension on the tape does not know you will be asked if the band is to be form@@ at@@ ted .
&quot; detect &amp; k@@ dat ; the pro@@ ach , it looks for the matching index on your plate . can this not be found , you will be asked if the band@@ index is to be created . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , changes the symbol for the band &apos;s drive to indicate that the band is involved . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the belt can now be searched out by folding the tape for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before leaving the belt , first of all the involvement must be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; returns through a change of symbol for the band , that the integration has been solved for the band and displays a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be thrown out without danger . &quot;
before a band can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
&quot; a band@@ ages must be form@@ at@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this procedure does not correspond to the form@@ atting with &amp; k@@ dat files ; this process requires not to be form@@ at@@ ted before you use the tape from &amp; k@@ dat files . flo@@ ppy belt flo@@ w@@ mill can usually be set up a form@@ atting of the belt , DAT drives , however . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band@@ name and the capacity continues &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the belt . all data on the tape are lost ! after conclusion of the format process , the band is automatically integrated and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the required files . this can happen in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only be stored in this file or folder .
select a secure profile in the tree . only the files given in the profile will be saved .
&quot; select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured . &quot;
right click on the local file tree and select in the menu Si@@ ght ...
&quot; once the backup has been introduced , the dialog will open up settings for backup . in this dialog you can check once again the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; when you confirm the settings , the dialog appears to secure the backup . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive , only the selected file or folder will be checked . &quot;
highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click on one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
&quot; once the audit process has been started , the dialog settings for verification . in this dialog you can check once again your choice and change the folder folder for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears to be checked . this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as the data set and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you enter the re @-@ establish , the files must be recovered , which are to be recovered . this can be done on two types : &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives , which includes entry for the belt drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder will be restored . &quot;
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu Re@@ generate ....
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog displays settings for recovery . in this dialog you can once again check your choice and change the folder folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for restoring it , the dialog appears to be re @-@ established . this dialog shows the progress of the process connection , as well as the flow rate and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to re @-@ create the band file from the band &apos;s tape file . this process is del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two kinds of tape :
&quot; in this way , a backup profile with the selected files and default settings is created . you can make the following settings for a backup profile : &quot;
&quot; the current folder , in which the backup should be made . the list of the data to secure files will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder . &quot;
&quot; for all folders which are listed under backup files , is that only the files currently are stored on the same file system , as the folder . folder , which are on other fil@@ esystem , you can register separately under backup files . each entry is viewed by tar independently of the others . &quot;
&quot; perform a incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file will be used . only those files are backed up since then . &quot;
the name of the file which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before the call of tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup will be created .
the functionality of buttons files are hidden ; and lt ; files were not yet fully implemented at the time of creation of this documentation .
the settings can be set up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the menu Settings . you can make the following settings :
the full path to device driver for the belt drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ tic version of the band device .
&quot; this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is involved , the command will be loaded to the drive . with some drives this is necessary before reading or typing operations . &quot;
&quot; if the option switched on , it tries to block &amp; k@@ dat ; it does not work with the belt drive . possibly this attitude does not work with all band@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , the det@@ achment of &amp; k@@ dat files ; automatically the band is thrown out . use this option not at Flo@@ ppy @-@ Stream@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the option switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ working block size for the belt drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your belt drive . &quot;
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band is form@@ at@@ ted it writes a file to the start of the belt . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
&quot; ( n Byte ) The Band @-@ ID . the format of this string is calcul@@ ator name : seconds , with billing name of the complete name of the system , on which the volume is form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time has been form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to use a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat files .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can manage directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar manage . even other tar versions should work , as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup job . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&quot; &amp; k@@ log log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system enables the different protocol files . furthermore , it allows you to provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&amp; k@@ way log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ eb@@ log ; is a simplified version of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who cannot know where to get information about your system or where the system deposited the different protocol files .
&quot; furthermore , &amp; k@@ system log ; experienced users give quick access to information on issues that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ systemic log ; therefore , try to provide some advanced functions with which the protocol files can be fil@@ tered and evaluated . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 &amp; k@@ eb@@ log ; a number of useful features include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following scre@@ enshot , introduces &amp; system log ; features available , with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily filter and sort . the individual options for sor@@ ting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start , the system protocol will be tried and system protocol ; first , the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol . you will not see it , and it will pop up instead of its small news window , so you have &amp; k@@ system log ; most likely not be associated with system managers . you usually do not have a permission to read / var / log , for the normal users usually no permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter the filter bar , so that only log @-@ lines will be displayed in the filter bar . the list of log lines will now be displayed automatically , so that only the log @-@ lines will display the entry field next to the filter . then a protocol line contains only the string of the string of the filter search . &quot;
&quot; you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter searches will then be selected only with the entries in the selected column . select the name of a process , and enter it in the filter bar the name of a process , so shows you &amp; k@@ system log ; all protocol lines are sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in default and helps you detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a striking colour as a protocol lines of level reference . the color display of protocol lines can be switched off @-@ line dialog .
&quot; if you want to display only certain process ( for example , in the system protocol or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , you can see the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , you can use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can also activate the option for new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new added record lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ log log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a protocol to display . &quot;
&amp; k@@ way log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system log@@ .@@ forum soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you can find more information about the supply sources of &amp; k@@ eb@@ log ;
&amp; k@@ way log ; you can also find in the following folder of &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion Archive : k@@ eb@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; system V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads to a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it is rapidly developing for the control of the program @-@ boot at the high drive of the system in the &amp; Linux system . therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not enter here further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine on System V In@@ it , without a re@@ installation and re @-@ format file . therefore , you need to ensure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it is also different from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc are right in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ .@@ D@@ ort you can find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folder :
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service that you want to start moving the system or moving to another Run@@ level . system services include such things such as set@@ ters , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc . system services include not such things as set@@ ters , which is only once started . such calls are according to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , r@@ c.@@ local should lie on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems possess this file , even if there is actually not much use for this file , even if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ f. in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to carry out something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one that he finds .
the standard @-@ level @-@ level is registered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you have to change it , then you can fix it by restart the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you want to enter r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is so written that there is an argument like start and stop . you can actually launch these scripts in hand on the command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it includes a K , the script will run with the argument stop . if it includes a S , the script will start with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to set up a simple way of setting machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server running level , which lets run only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . run beyond that , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another sign device is simple to un@@ say : simply draw an entry from the range of Av@@ ail@@ able system services to one of the six Run@@ level to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can also shift scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within one level by changing it elsewhere . this will only happen if it will take an entry from the range of available system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved , if you drag them into a new area . to simply copy it from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert in the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ ting number one entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you need to edit the sor@@ ting numbers of the surrounding entries , before you can try again to add the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : currently there is no way to restore entries , which were thrown into the trash . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the Tab@@ ulator button to activate the different fields of work ( available system services , Run@@ level 1 start , Run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of top or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another Run@@ level , move it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired run@@ level with inser@@ ts ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sor@@ ting number or the name of a contract manually , press the input button to switch between different fields . include the dialog by selecting the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to reject the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu require confirmation before it will be executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . preferences are removed from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; they will be saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ le@@ vel@@ n and now the machine starts new . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to launch in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default @-@ level on a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
&quot; I have planned some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under Run@@ level X , but they will not be executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( LD ) , then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way , how system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simplify the configuration for proprietary furniture programs of this distri@@ butions , but does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; are planning an extension of the program for that approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use any other distribution : please check if any configuration files are present , which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) just end without message when their configuration files are not present or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the importance of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation is related to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; to begin , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you must save it . either use the appropriate icon of the tool@@ bar or entry in the menu file . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two mapping cards , the user interface and the username list . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog User &apos;s or group properties . &quot;
&quot; some car@@ nal cards are only shown , if you have made advanced system settings . only if you have any advanced settings ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a mapping card will be created where you can make individual settings for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD Unix . &quot;
&quot; the lists of password is available , in case of shadow - passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ ces are installed . &quot;
this cardboard card appears only if for at least a built @-@ in fil@@ esystem ( Qu@@ ota ) will be activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable at the file quot@@ as user / quot@@ as group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here you can change parameters in each user :
&quot; these parameters can be adjusted for each file system separately . the current fil@@ esystem will be selected with the help of the field file system with space . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ tei@@ card groups will be informed about the group belonging of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , you will find in the prime prime group . furthermore , the user can be joined in other groups by mark those in the large box . &quot;
&quot; the dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or a group , select Add from the user or group or click the appropriate add @-@ button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group is analog . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the L@@ ILO boot Manager , remove and change the time up to the boot of the standard system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change operating systems , change , modify and more . &quot;
