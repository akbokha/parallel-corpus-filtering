<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to fix exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the version came; tool colouring effects will provide you with four color effects, a solar system effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a channel filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatians, was also called Sabatians, an effect of the original light. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negativity of the image. this tool allows you to jusze this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar power. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. an additional increase is ultimately a negative image that is not created on photopapier."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar energy efficiency. the original image is (1) and this works (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation thus making the colors brilliant and glowing. try it easy to embellish many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">"Velvia is the brand name produced for one on daylight reversed color film that is produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therefore a reference for his smooth image structure. Veloas strongly saturated colors are also a few photographers, especially those who barely abuses landscapes."</seg>
<seg id="416">"the neonfilter simulates neonlight on the contraction. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result, and the shooting repetitions the strength of the neonliché. in large images the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon for you to reviewing the different color aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustment can be content in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo with bad light conditions you can get the opposite problem: one too big satiation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation will reduce it. all changes you can perform in preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple lamp-strength / contrast / gamma is the tool tone lasty for improvement of exposure. even if the dialog to this tool very complicated, you need only the area of the slider. concrete the three slider below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of Intensity, an Histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph there are three levers in which can be clicked, and which can be postponed to change the intensity values of the picture. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the regulator and look at it how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right side, the original and preview of the picture can be seen. the preview is dynamically updated, based on the settings of the picture. on the left-hand side, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">"scaling: with this selection box can be adjusted if the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for pictures of a digital camera, linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic classification is useful."</seg>

<seg id="434">"in addition to this box, two symbols are to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures that have been recorded with a digital camera. for pictures with large areas of constant color, the linear mode generates a wide beams. in this case, the logarithmic mode continues."</seg>
<seg id="435">"for example, if you want to move a short panel to the right, for example the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright sounds are corresponding with dark cabs and that the associated image pixels are darker."</seg>
<seg id="436">"on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see. if you want to change this marker on the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is to your taste."</seg>

<seg id="479">& Check; represents three different tools for focal areas. each one of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpens is a traditional tool to field edge. it is very fast and simple, but generates, especially in dark fields, granular images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"Unsharpness mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. you can use it, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric toxins and it makes a really good job. the algorithm has been taken out of Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three as it really enhances the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has several parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digital images need a correction of the edge. this is due to the digitalization process colors with minimal differences to a color point. that's the same phenomenon can be observed if colors are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more detrimental depth than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">"with JPEG-images, a camera is often used to have internal shareholding. images in the raw-format, on the other hand, must always be used during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner can turn a focal filter already during the reading of the image. if you disable it, you get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can obtain useful results by sharpens a photo with the field of edge advertising. this allows you to start using the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">"however, you should be careful about how the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the edge of edges, but also increases the consuming technique to sharpens the tool. you can easily reach it on the menu entry. you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques for edge."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: an image is too crackable. the solution to draw the picture a little soft, is much easier than it. use the tool for softness with the menu entry correlation softness and experiment something with settings. the preview of the menu on the right of the Dialoges shows you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blur is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview may help to edit the picture. the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values often produce good results and should be tested first. an increase in the radius or the amount will reinforce the effect. if you make the discomfort mask, smokers and the impression of seeds in the vicinity of sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">"the radius is like a lot of pixels on each side of a canoe through the filter. high-resolution images allow bigger radii. therefore, they should best raise images best in their final resolution."</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the knocked picture added to the original. thereby the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swelling value is a break from the maximum RGB value and the use difference. this way, a minimum difference can be defined for a edge of filters. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones of sharps are exempt and therefore, beauty errors in faces, heavens and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed picture the (2). unsharp masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a Corpora value = 0.0. "</seg>
<seg id="496">The & checking came; tool Refocused refocuses a picture by improving the edge of the field. it used to use the copyrighted vault filter algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries a picture to & quot; refocused quot; this is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses usually better results as unsharp mask. you can start it from the menu by running colors Refocus in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice the circular thread operates much better than the Gauß'sche Faltung. the Gauß'sche Faltung has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixel, which is far from the original pixel rate. the FIR Vienna inverse of the Gauß'schen thread is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the distant pixel. the causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folded. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images the standard value should set 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very blurred but then on vitpons.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. useful values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">"smoking filter: an increase in the filter filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0,1 only rarely helpful. if the smoking filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a high value is 0.03. a high value is to be expanded."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß'sche sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß'sche sharpness. use this parameter if your insharpness Gauß'sch is. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you have a value equal to zero, so you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the smoking filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matches size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the size size can produce good results, especially if you select great values for the circular edge or the Gauß'schen field. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">"saving as well as store buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any additional focus on the parameter you have set will therefore be saved for later, and can be loaded."</seg>
<seg id="505">"try all the cuts, color and intensive corrections on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you otherwise change the picture. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read images and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the unzipped image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, unsharp mashers produces better results than sharpens. this could be caused by the sharp masking to use a bigger neighborhood than sharpens."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, it is necessary to create blur measles ever artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of the sharpening filter. in practice, the result of the FIR Wiener Filters is always at least as good as the Unsharpness mask. the FIR Vienna Filter is often better for the processing of small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filtern, on a small unfocused picture:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture has to be corrected. this picture was made with an analogue camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto-focus Linse.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information about the methods of focal design, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address."</seg>

<seg id="519">Detail-keeping p [0] 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to an evenly smoothing over the picture. a value of 0.9 should be sharp. a value of 0.9 should be required. please note that the details of detail should always be subordinate.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction addictive Alpha [0.100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. JPEG artifacts are best eliminated with a value in the vicinity of 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0] 500]: this sets the maximum glasses factor above all. then define the relative smoothing. therefore put this value appropriate to the degree of smoking in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: these parameters affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is necessary, as it is difficult to generate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: returns how often the algorithm is passed through. usually it ranges from 1 or 2 out.</seg>
<seg id="524">"[5] 90] reply: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha is selected, it should also be too small. therefore, you should make sure that small angles will be a long runtime. you should therefore choose this value as a maximum possible and acceptable to your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"inclusive stride range [0,1, 10]: inclusive stride with pixel. you should put the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation uses: the more quality you receive by choosing this option is only low. but it doubles the runtime. we recommend it to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and shop exactly do this. any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file and recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors are comparatively very fast when working. but nevertheless it can take very long and take a high CPU load after you. therefore you can abort the calculation at any time with the button break.</seg>

<seg id="535">"radius controls the size size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filters. large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and allows the image to be blending through the image and the color in it will be smoothed and therefore smaller bugs."</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the focal point. this value sets the pixel rate. if it is increased to change the filter filter you may need to change the edges filter. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter details does not get more and noise or lubricate occurs again. "</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge-precision for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong can not occur the entire robbery or smoking tips can occur. put it at a value close to the maximum when you want to remove a more vigilant smoking or JPEG-artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the lightness of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change a picture. these settings do not affect the glasses process that is controlled by the details.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the colour-tolerant of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change a picture. these settings do not affect the glasses process that is controlled by the details.</seg>

<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a gap of 1 from the pixelblock to be drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolishing pixels on the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are put in to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cuban: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi-Cuban interface (2-dim) or a group of Cuban curves (1-dim) that will then be used to interpolishing pixels in the block.</seg>

<seg id="571">"density: this parameter controls the degree of light weight absorption at the point of the largest density. the default density is 2,0, which compensate for a optical filter with a aperture adjustment of 1, or by chance to compensate the density of a greater degree of Vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree."</seg>
<seg id="572">"luminosity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the Vignetting corrections reduces the luminosity of the target image. you need to restart the exposure of the target image with these options. the regulators provide you with only positive values as you just need to increase the settings."</seg>

<seg id="654">The Golden Center provides liquid aid lines if you set up a picture. these help are enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal. compared to third elregel, the golden spiral creates a liquid line which can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the viewer's view along the line of the spiral, and creates an symmetric flow on this type."</seg>
<seg id="656">"another rule is the right corner of the golden spiral, also called the golden corner. these rectangular area are used to specify the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects. this something can simply be given without the eye, it will fulfil its mission."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the triangles also derive from the top of the golden spiral. their vertices are the middle points of the pages of the golden corner. note that in contrast to harmonious tritriangles, Golden triangles are not a equilateral triangles. diagonale can be placed on these lines can be a static object of dynamical."</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame generate a effect that is called by professional photographers dynamic symmetry. try to place your image processing at one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't achieve any other way.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontally flip and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button Color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you can have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the aid lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to turn a picture to any corner.</seg>
<seg id="662">"if you make a photo, then it happens easily that you are not exactly vertical or horizontal. this creates a picture in which things turned around an angle. you can fix this using the & checking; image processing and tool free rotation, select Free Rotation and justing the destination angle."</seg>

<seg id="664">"for your help, the module is free Rotation to position a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the picture show around the two lines. once you fix it on an important point of the picture you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now you have described the angle as described in the previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot an image you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair it is the function transformers to use the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the function automation cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliasing smoothes the picture a bit after the spin. take note of the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectional transformations are carried out by a fixed point of reference to the so-called reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically recomputed. on the right of the Dialoges you will find some information which help you to change the perspective:</seg>

<seg id="676">"according to the adaptation of the perspective the picture becomes a little wasted. for a single adjustment, this effect is small but two adjustments produce a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">"after leaving the perspective, you get unjoyous triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to cut it to some is to cut the image with transformers from the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="678">The utility tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite. this is no spin, the image will be distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module over transformers. "</seg>
<seg id="679">Scissors your picture by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. you can push horizontally and vertically at the same time. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will appear on the right of the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="680">"to your help, a vertical and a horizontal line appears. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines to adjust your image."</seg>
<seg id="681">"after you have carried out the shot, the picture becomes a bit blurred. for a single shot this effect is usually negligible, but two shots generated twice as much disblending and hence you should avoid this."</seg>

<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive approach; adaptive because every pixel is repeatedely further divided and adaptive because every pixel is repeatedely further divided and adaptive because the rectory width depends on the calculated colors."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracked a beam depending on pixels. if you adjust the difference between the color values to the neighboring pixels with super sampling. if you adjust the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive approach starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the predetermined threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 subpixel, which can be followed individually and checked for further subordination. the maximum depth of recursion can be set with the depth value."</seg>

<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= This option should usually offer for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs ever 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good Genug for music of young people, portable devices and autostereosystem. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this attitude will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information which is manually caught manually or by the program automatically from the freeDB over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can be handed / used to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program opinion for the encoding and these parameters here. the manual or help to the encoders explain the switches for these programmes."</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD: title to the keywords (English: day) when MP3s are coded with lame the switches has to be added from lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button drawing in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which individuals can download the audio CDs to enter the information instead of using text: & CD; title, artist, names of pieces & etc., not by the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal but I (Anm of the actuator) is not an attorney. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; any more or less value, so neither the artist nor the music company are damaged. all information can be saved in a bumblebee by a & CD; store, physically or virtual."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"in & kaudiocreator; is active a cross-box address (Send an address). for the use of freeDB may be used with another (counterfeit) address used in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the e-mail address is not used when retribution the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)"</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator, set up for the use of freeDB, the geographically is needed at the nearest mirror server. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"a visit to freedb.org delivers a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the actualizations of the database."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which instructor will be used to save pieces from the & CD; stored in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumors that this cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely, search in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see to note that the cdparanoia package from the appropriate distribution must be installed first, if this is not yet done."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"to save the full WAV files, the encoding and hence the desired file format can be chosen. at first opening are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss-free compressing for audio data) on the tab for setting up the code. other encoders can be added to this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoding package needs to be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the encoding can be used. this is also required for predefined encoders. more information about encoders are located in the chapter of Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a code, you can get more information about his switches by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a context window (eg; console)."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check the establishment of the device-drawing of the & CD; / DVD drives, the desks and reading real on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc.). try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give an indication of what is wrong."</seg>
<seg id="1541">"check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD, check out the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!"</seg>
<seg id="1542">"there is a chapter with a step for step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips how to proceed."</seg>
<seg id="1543">"read the complete manual, everything understood, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want."</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will launch the program for the first time everything up and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps average and ID3v1 keyboards (tags).</seg>

<seg id="1548">"the second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD, which must be repeated for any read & CD."</seg>
<seg id="1549">"here we determine the use of encoding to compression of the music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 until 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we divide the program to load the freeDB around the & CD; data from the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="1550">"although we can change these settings at any time, we will likely not change it with each reading a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found."</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device-drawing is handed over to the reading program so that it can read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">"frequently, / dev / CDROM is a symbolic link to the actual equipment designation of your drive. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, even if on the drive with other programs, you can also get a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the available entries for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives."</seg>

<seg id="1661">In this section the patches are shown as the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the leftist side of the equals sign is ignored. it is believed that the GM patches in the correct order will be available (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also have no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional All KeysTo M is needed to put all notes that this instrument need to put on the tone with the number M (e.g. with Ton 60), which may be similar to a gun. to this end, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so when a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (barrel signal), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is available in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant, with which every sound represents a different percussioner instrument (drum, pelvis, Maracas / etc.) and not the one in which the tone represents the clay-height of the same drum (like some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section will be used to indicate how sounds are shown on a particular channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the order of the lines is very important as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to form tones on the perkame channel. look at the given keymaps as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to switch some channels to others. if you want to swap the first and second channel, simply make it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel (general MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following patterns:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"n this channel is the channel, which is displayed on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap will naturally be defined in the file. if you use the Forcepatch option, all events will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case it will always be patch."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to always use the perkame patch on the perkame channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBender Ratio is multiplied, in which relationship Pitch-Bender-events is multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a Pitch-Bender event with the value n, this is used with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only conveyed. the value 4096 is used so that there is no decimal number in the map file."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM gives you a keyboard, which is a pitch-rate event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, try to find some keyboards by two notes up to an octave. to try the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. you will find this in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canalview is a window with a whole range of pianos (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos you see which sounds are currently playing.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel, there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument, lights up the button no longer green but red, to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>

<seg id="1681">"the speed-LCD shows the speed, with which a song is played down. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the pace of a song. so if you find e.g. a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc. with this, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can force anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control of everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this may happen if you have compiled a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without Awe support, you need to download a source distribution (for example from Cmid; 's Home)"</seg>

<seg id="2281">So there are lots of graphic tools for the same. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The compilation was very complicated because one of the contributors had made a lot of changes and at the same time had changed a lot of text at the same time. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly was changed inside these lines. and there was no evidence on the places where perhaps just the reciration had changed. this change was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">So that was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could show differences within a line and changes to white signs. later a lot of other useful features have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"if you want to compare the text for example, simply copy it into the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparative window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">"a function that made a lot of work was the comparisons, and merge from folders. this function changed & kdiff3; almost in a full-full file browser."</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way together is fully supported. this is useful when two persons operate independently of one piece of code and make modifications. the original file (the base) helps to solve the correct modifications. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three Quell files in combination with:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you with the same and merge complete folder. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder:</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& kdiff3; displays the exact differences, and showed up the possibilities of today's colour monitors. if you often have to check code, you will like this function."</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are visible are visible. if the lines differ only in a certain number of white signs you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no trouble passing if someone else is changing.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">"when a file is equal, and the other is different in a row, then the color indicate which file is different. red color means that both files differ."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all the files are the same name, but in different folders, you can ease the Tipparwork by writing only the filename of the first file. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">"diff3 folder 1 folder, 1 folder 2 folder: 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder..."</seg>
<seg id="2294">"open dialog permits the manual type of filenames, selecting from the file browser (file...) or selecting an last opened file from the list. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of differences with two files will be performed."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you choose a folder, the comparisons will be introduced, for B and C, however, a folder, then uses & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"if together, the input field is active and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily required to set an output file immediately. you can also get this step later when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"the insertion button opens a dialog with settings. here, you can set options before starting with the comparisons."</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes one does not want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to choose text parts from the clipboard in the active comparison window. the comparison begins immediately. in opening-dialog you will have to select no files, you can simply close the dialog with the break button."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and paste: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"which thought is behind it? sometimes, a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar to these functions, it would be a relatively large effort. you would have to simply download two appropriate files, put them into & kdiff3; now you can easily copy the relevant sections, and then compare."</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can draw nothing out & kdiff3; only the case of text in a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">"warning: some editors interpret the pulling and drafting text into another program than cutting and inserting (instead of copying and inserting). in such a case, your original data could be lost."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"in the upper part of each text box is the info line. the info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the pointer number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Each Info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest a while on the line. then a small relief window will display the full name.)"</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three source windows are assigned the letter A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed through the Settings menu.)"</seg>
<seg id="2305">"when a difference is detected, one sees the color, which file differs. if both files differ, the predefined color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. this is in the next section (leading) well."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"left next to the text you find the summary column. if differences were found, the column shows the appropriate color. in some programming languages where white signs are not so important, it is useful to only see the relevant changes. (at C / C + + e.g. are white signs only in strings and comments, for the preessor and in few, rare items.)"</seg>
<seg id="2307">"the vertical line, which separates the contraction column from the text, is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the pointer is enabled, the line will be dotted on broken lines."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"result window (among the comparison windows) has also an info line with the wording of output:, the filename and [change] if you have finished the result already text, but often it also contains conflicts."</seg>
<seg id="2309">"!!! until all conflicts are dissolved, the store is disabled!!! (use the buttons jump to the most populate / unsolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"if only two comparators are used, each difference must also be resolved at the same time a conflict of manually."</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking on the left mouse button in one of the windows the group is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed. (this will also be a jump to the position inside the windows where the top of the group is otherwise highlighted.) This group is highlighted the current group. it will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and the left appears a black beam.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"sometimes, by automatic merge or by manual editing no more line is left in the group; then it is only a placeholder for the case that you change your mind and perhaps again select another source. this text appears either in the final stored file, nor in a marking that you may need to copy and paste it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2313">"the text & lt; summarised conflicts; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy such text from the result window. go careful with this function."</seg>
<seg id="2314">"note: if you select the sources the options include or ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also dealt with as white signs."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"navigating is mainly used with the portrait and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are used in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, bottom, og-beginning and strg end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs. the Overview column next to the vertical image bar can also be used to navigate."</seg>

<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only be stored in this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a secure profile in the tree. only the files given in the profile will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="2906">"select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are secured."</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right click on the local file tree and select in the menu Sight...</seg>
<seg id="2908">"once the backup has been introduced, the dialog will open up settings for backup. in this dialog you can check once again the selected files and change the settings for backup."</seg>

<seg id="2910">"select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive, only the selected file or folder will be checked."</seg>
<seg id="2911">Highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>

<seg id="2914">"if you have confirmed the settings for the review, the dialog appears to be checked. this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as the data set and the remaining time."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"before you enter the re-establish, the files must be recovered, which are to be recovered. this can be done on two types:"</seg>
<seg id="2916">"select a file or folder in one of the archives, which includes entry for the belt drive. it will only restore the selected file or subfolder."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolder will be restored."</seg>

<seg id="2920">"if you have confirmed the settings for restoring it, the dialog appears to be re-established. this dialog shows the progress of the process connection, as well as the flow rate and the remaining time."</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to re-create the band file from the band's tape file. this process is deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two kinds of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">"in this way, a backup profile with the selected files and default settings is created. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:"</seg>
<seg id="2923">"the current folder, in which the backup should be made. the list of the data to secure files will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"for all folders which are listed under backup files, is that only the files currently are stored on the same file system, as the folder. folder, which are on other filesystem, you can register separately under backup files. each entry is viewed by tar independently of the others."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"perform a incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file will be used. only those files are backed up since then."</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file which is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the call of tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup will be created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files are hidden; and lt; files were not yet fully implemented at the time of creation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up via the menu item KDat... in the menu Settings. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to device driver for the belt drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-retic version of the band device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">"this setting is active, transmits & kdat; before the band is involved, the command will be loaded to the drive. with some drives this is necessary before reading or typing operations."</seg>
<seg id="2932">"if the option switched on, it tries to block & kdat; it does not work with the belt drive. possibly this attitude does not work with all bandages."</seg>
<seg id="2933">"if the option is switched on, the detachment of & kdat files; automatically the band is thrown out. use this option not at Floppy-Streamors."</seg>
<seg id="2934">"the option switched on, tries & kdat; the hardworking block size for the belt drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you need & kdat; in any case the block size for your belt drive."</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band is formatted it writes a file to the start of the belt. this file should only show a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">"(n Byte) The Band-ID. the format of this string is calculator name: seconds, with billing name of the complete name of the system, on which the volume is formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time has been formatted."</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to use a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat files.</seg>
<seg id="2938">"the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can manage directly with & GNU; - tar manage. even other tar versions should work, as long as it is not about incremental backups."</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup job. this symbol is only active when a band is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">"& klog log; is a & kde; -viewer for system protocols. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can't know where you can get information about your system or where the system enables the different protocol files. furthermore, it allows you to provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server."</seg>
<seg id="2941">& kway log; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & keblog; is a simplified version of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who cannot know where to get information about your system or where the system deposited the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">"furthermore, & ksystem log; experienced users give quick access to information on issues that occur on their server. & ksystemic log; therefore, try to provide some advanced functions with which the protocol files can be filtered and evaluated."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 & keblog; a number of useful features include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the following screenshot, introduces & system log; features available, with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily filter and sort. the individual options for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start, the system protocol will be tried and system protocol; first, the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol. you will not see it, and it will pop up instead of its small news window, so you have & ksystem log; most likely not be associated with system managers. you usually do not have a permission to read / var / log, for the normal users usually no permission to read."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter the filter bar, so that only log-lines will be displayed in the filter bar. the list of log lines will now be displayed automatically, so that only the log-lines will display the entry field next to the filter. then a protocol line contains only the string of the string of the filter search."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter searches will then be selected only with the entries in the selected column. select the name of a process, and enter it in the filter bar the name of a process, so shows you & ksystem log; all protocol lines are sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default and helps you detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a striking colour as a protocol lines of level reference. the color display of protocol lines can be switched off-line dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to display only certain process (for example, in the system protocol or in the cron protocol), you can see the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, you can use filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can also activate the option for new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new added record lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& klog log; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage. once you have selected a sub-window, select a protocol to display."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& kway log; has its own website on http: / / ksystem log.forum software.org. Dort you can find more information about the supply sources of & keblog;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& kway log; you can also find in the following folder of & kde; Subversion Archive: keblog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; system V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also as named) as & ksysv; this section leads to a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init is rapidly developing for the control of the program-boot at the high drive of the system in the & Linux system. therefore, because it is easier to use, powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD-Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not enter here further on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is below / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine on System V Init, without a reinstallation and re-format file. therefore, you need to ensure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">SysV Init is also different from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc are right in / etc. this folder is called rc..Dort you can find rc.sysinit and the following other folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for any system service that you want to start moving the system or moving to another Runlevel. system services include such things such as setters, httpd & etc. system services include not such things as setters, which is only once started. such calls are according to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"on the one hand, rc.local should lie on the one hand under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems possess this file, even if there is actually not much use for this file, even if you want to run a rc.f. in / etc / rc.d if you want to carry out something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one that he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard-level-level is registered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you have to change it, then you can fix it by restart the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the correct scripts? if you want to enter rc3.d, you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is so written that there is an argument like start and stop. you can actually launch these scripts in hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it includes a K, the script will run with the argument stop. if it includes a S, the script will start with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people wish to set up a simple way of setting machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server running level, which lets run only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. run beyond that, I could also have a user -Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another sign device is simple to unsay: simply draw an entry from the range of Available system services to one of the six Runlevel to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also shift scripts between Runleveln or change the position within one level by changing it elsewhere. this will only happen if it will take an entry from the range of available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved, if you drag them into a new area. to simply copy it from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert in the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number one entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries, before you can try again to add the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: currently there is no way to restore entries, which were thrown into the trash. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the Tabulator button to activate the different fields of work (available system services, Runlevel 1 start, Runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of top or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another Runlevel, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired runlevel with inserts (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of a contract manually, press the input button to switch between different fields. include the dialog by selecting the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to reject the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu require confirmation before it will be executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences are removed from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise they will be saved by & ksysv; they will be saved by & ksysv; they will be saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard runleveln and now the machine starts new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to launch in single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default-level on a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have planned some system services with & ksysv; for running under Runlevel X, but they will not be executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE; or Delix (LD), then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way, how system services are started in these distributions, simplify the configuration for proprietary furniture programs of this distributions, but does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; are planning an extension of the program for that approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use any other distribution: please check if any configuration files are present, which are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) just end without message when their configuration files are not present or wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the importance of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the runlevel, so that this manual can be added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is related to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to begin with & kuser; to begin, it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you have made changes, you must save it. either use the appropriate icon of the toolbar or entry in the menu file."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two mapping cards, the user interface and the username list. to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog User's or group properties."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some carnal cards are only shown, if you have made advanced system settings. only if you have any advanced settings (Quota) for users, a mapping card will be created where you can make individual settings for example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD Unix."</seg>
<seg id="2994">"the lists of password is available, in case of shadow - passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD-Unices are installed."</seg>
<seg id="2995">This cardboard card appears only if for at least a built-in filesystem (Quota) will be activated and initialized (recognizable at the file quotas user / quotas group on the filesystem). here you can change parameters in each user:</seg>
<seg id="2996">"these parameters can be adjusted for each file system separately. the current filesystem will be selected with the help of the field file system with space."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the carteicard groups will be informed about the group belonging of the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, you will find in the prime prime group. furthermore, the user can be joined in other groups by mark those in the large box."</seg>
