although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is exceptionally large .
&quot; as many of my generation I grew up with American films , I danced to American music , American authors read and run his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had a very profound impact on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; when I was 14 years old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter , who with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ ed covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil mag@@ nat@@ ing with judges who were interested to occupy their interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; I was , as if the absolute truth is , forget everything else , this is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year that I lived in Arizona , I had only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the USA . &quot;
&quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting you can always be the one you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even had a very black@@ ish love letter written about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the xen@@ ophobia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his narrow @-@ minded .
he never stops his opinion behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and openly explains his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and Women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in favor of him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes which he won in the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number , which ever reached by the Party nom@@ ination candidate . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ote person I asked myself ?
I was able to get Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I had to know during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the journalist programme , the people from all over the world , a deeply smooth person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; the tr@@ umps of world views not coinci@@ ded with the author of Peter Bh@@ atia , the current editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ atia and I had met our common love for basketball , and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; in the game . &quot;
&quot; trac@@ umps in@@ tolerant is also in contrast to the generosity that I had during Sandy B@@ ahr which fights her life for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me as their son . &quot;
she is still adapting to the involvement of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es who always with a lot of patience and grace helped me and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of American life .
&quot; then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice has helped me a lot during my career . &quot;
these people and the values of them em@@ bodied my love for America .
&quot; as Tr@@ ump of his way to nom@@ inees for Republi@@ can candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps precisely because of his cont@@ emp@@ t for non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the discussion with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump because they either shared its racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to overlook these things , I broke down almost the heart . &quot;
maybe it is unfair to call the tr@@ ump vot@@ er than rac@@ ists .
&quot; to classi@@ fy people , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is superficial and respectful , and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think . &quot;
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the h@@ ectic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of which are white , voted for tr@@ ump because they would like to re@@ win control of a country that has disappointed it ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who look down with cont@@ emp@@ t for those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; ( An@@ m d. WC . : as much as &quot; drawing the White against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; &quot; word game from white in touch on the White and whi@@ plas@@ h , which means so much as ch@@ id@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as it was called the great Van Jones , has just killed what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people all over the world appreciate American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - what faith or background you like , America is always welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ers whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; however , with the election of Donald Tr@@ umps , there is a huge part of the white America this promise to and says : to hell with multiple freedom , freedom of religion and the whole concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again on the ruin , they say . &quot;
&quot; in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word @-@ change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the quantity rep@@ lied with a sil@@ ently &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; brood the amount . &quot;
&quot; do you have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; answering them . &quot;
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they called and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; could anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; he received a consistent and sil@@ ently &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan closed with words , &quot; &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the country , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ umps Country , &quot; &quot; said the message . &quot;
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America .
and that breaks me my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children can not spoil their love for music by the rub@@ b@@ ish

what has the Mexican music school in the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero municipality in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean town of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
&quot; the music that is played at both places , not only the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the br@@ ink of a large garbage dump , only 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among the tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby magnificent ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for several years now , La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the municipality : one of children and adults @-@ existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orches@@ tras , which has found a way to overcome them . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community that is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico is known for its drugs abuse and gangs force .
&quot; but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and offered the youth so a rare hope of hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band@@ members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press not@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI . &quot;
once they come from school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to go to their great passion .
&quot; they come and play with sparkling eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clar@@ inet , O@@ bo@@ e , flute , forest horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ go and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from garbage
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments that are made of recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with recur@@ rent instruments , which consist of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for music instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura where the recycled under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez began to transform parts of the breakdown into instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ as , viol@@ as , c@@ elli , double bass , guit@@ ars , sa@@ xes , trump@@ ets , trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones and perc@@ ussion , which were all made out of the trash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classic music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez is a local ec@@ ologist and musician instructor of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , at the beginning of time : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ sals and we had to teach at the same place where parents never knew music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them don &apos;t live with their children . &quot;
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : one out of waste from the violin .
&quot; today , there is an orchestra which plays on instruments from re @-@ prepared material and called The recycled Orchestra . &quot;
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) draws the musical performance to :
the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
&quot; those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and this is where they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ational spectacle from trash to music around the world .
the orchestra has even played his music before Pope Francis .
these East African countries show how technology and team work can fight illegal fishing successfully
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fought the wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practical solutions to environmental problems . &quot;
re @-@ release occurs in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
&quot; in West Africa , this ship was known then that this ship had already operated illegal fishing , before it was sought out the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries have therefore been raised , accordingly , and little inclined to welcome a legislative bre@@ cher of this kind on their shores . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seychelles mobili@@ zed themselves quickly against the ship . they refused him , one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fishing place . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Ur@@ suddenly , the prime minister was surrounded by countries that just refused it , &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , is a leader of the Ken@@ yan fisheries authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship &apos;s time and followed . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of pill@@ age of fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO stop illeg@@ ally stop ( Il@@ legal fisheries ) . &quot;
&quot; the members of this network are of Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries that were driven at that time the prime minister from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; we have eight countries , which are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and are mutually exclusive when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable trusts project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : which is caught , is hidden , absent because it is extremely difficult to record . thus , illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the inten@@ tional dis@@ respect of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are supposed to be protected , illegal fishing ecosystems can harm , which have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing once were disabled by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the snow @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries are cur@@ ated , so the actions occur in real time , with trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , the individual countries can share with other lists of existing licenses , updates on suspi@@ cion activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; Fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive , if these are moving at the open sea , using satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to identify the authorities , ships that fish in the botanical areas . also , you can discover that a ship invites its prisoners of fish on the road to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations may show whether the participating ships have a fish roy@@ alty where they were on the road and perhaps , whether they have a pen@@ al ister . &quot;
&quot; countries who are opposed to illegal fishing are on basis of this information to refuse the adoption of such ships in their har@@ bours . what means that the ships could not sell their charge . and that they could even be forced to numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a serious financial loss for the owner , meaning that illegal fishing is financially no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , Chief Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to gain estimated 20 million USD in lost sales , representing the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i each year due to illegal fishermen who penetrate into East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing villages , which attracts the region &apos;s commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also seven illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; their practices include actions such as the sailing under false flag , fake license papers , indicating of fanta@@ sies , the fish @-@ protected species and the fish in nature conservation areas . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they deliberately utilize the missing international cooperation and make up the weaknesses of a non @-@ organized control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier , a ship was illegal and a country could then say &quot; You dar@@ ken@@ ed my harbour . &quot;
&quot; yet another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and exactly this alleg@@ ation hole trying to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
so far the closed front works .
since its foundation F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ ects .
&quot; it has uncovered criminal networks , which had been distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties , and it has found volati@@ le ships and found . &quot;
&quot; due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our studies lead us quite far into the networks organized crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; he builds a system , which is to help F@@ ISH @-@ i , susp@@ ects ships more precise . &quot;
photo with kind permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always further developed , also helps to split the illegal ships that are happy to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and position , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tracking , an NGO , which also deals with fisheries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships also turn off their automatic identification systems , which they can no longer figure out of satellites . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects various information levels with each other . it aims to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
one model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team African nations actually influence influence on the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened together with Google and the protection organization Oc@@ e@@ ana , the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite channels and can be displayed via the position of each trac@@ e@@ able ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; join together with neighbours to get a better picture of who what to do - this simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable trusts have allowed a similar project in which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only felt in criminals , but also deter@@ red . &quot;
&quot; ships used to conf@@ is@@ cated previously without a license and hardly expected to reck@@ on with consequences , now they know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating to F@@ ISH @-@ i have now captured a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fishing boats can buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped , Gre@@ ko 1 found , the inspec@@ tors found there on board Schle@@ pp@@ nets , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo with kind permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strongly that we now also copy other countries &quot; , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study subject . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries joined together , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With certainty , the goal is to make even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia opened its first big triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was under false flag on the road . and not only was the ship used without a license and were used to@@ wing gri@@ ds which meanwhile were prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penetr@@ ated in botanical waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong signal that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is a further success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , collaborative way of work on the protection of the oceans actually works throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . there she writes about environment , technique and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . location in Venezuela has pointed to : demonstrations in several cities with the goal to conquer &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they are considered to be protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela has rejected the request of opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans reacted to the political and economic crisis of the country into emp@@ t@@ iness by gathering itself on the streets . &quot;
the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the Venezu@@ elan of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land area Bar@@ inas , in the Andes @-@ regions Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central @-@ north @-@ north of the district of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the federal state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country is deterior@@ ating continuously , which makes itself noticeable in the daily life of the Vene@@ tians by an acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the Opposition saw the chance of opposition from the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro as the chance of a fundamental change ; however , the res@@ tra@@ int was blocked by a re@@ election of the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sums up the context of the governmental authorities in their latest article : &quot;
&quot; in the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the in@@ flows and violence existed among the highest levels in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the year degree ) and in which a grave shortage of food and medicine was considered the only way to regain its institutional structures and close a new governance approach . &quot;
&quot; the electoral bloc of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Party ) to join the majority of representatives of the opposition . here , a twelve @-@ hour strike , on the next day , and a march to the Miraflores palace , the Venezu@@ elan government seat , should continue on November 3rd , should continue to continue the block@@ age of the referendum . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
&quot; as far as Venezuela is Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on 3 November all go to Miraflores palace . &quot;

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the programme &quot; &quot; The Re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 . &quot;
&quot; the images of the mar@@ ches which are published in real time testify among other things a overwhelming involvement in people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with poli@@ c@@ emen as well as advoc@@ acy of the government . &quot;
&quot; one of the most common images shows a demonstr@@ ator that calls through the shiel@@ ds , &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I have hunger ? &quot;
&quot; will you kill me , because I have hunger ? &quot; &quot; crying this vene@@ er . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , pictures to tell about disputes , as well as reports of oppression and abuse . &quot;
particularly large waves hit the news of poli@@ cing oppression in the central @-@ north @-@ north city of Marac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators returned to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement from the police and the armed forces of the government .
&quot; hours later they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went further . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country some prot@@ esters , to hold the police forces , including this woman in the coun@@ sel of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not bear redness , because you could see something else , what many nation@@ alists do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an Info@@ graphic is already doing the round that forms the scale of oppression a day : &quot;
so the dictatorship has sup@@ pressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a minister of ministers - this was now proven in the eyes of many by the presence of innumerable people on the streets .
My@@ te@@ ks Media Labs include :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dad@@ o claim that 1 % of sig@@ natures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your expul@@ sion !
on the road !
&quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government who made up a little against the devastating economic crisis , and rather has dealt with critical voices , critical voices . &quot;
they have taken us so much - but also fear !

the interview was translated into English and will be published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to join the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as the meantime , an adult man told Qui@@ j@@ ano as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Córdoba to his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial that ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes have been examined , which were committed during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not picked up his life .
&quot; starting at the Bür@@ de , to carry the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough . &quot;
34 years he held family secrecy for himself .
&quot; in that situation then , I believed that was fine . &quot;
I felt like a wal@@ k@@ ent .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that you can be manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; I could not know at that time , that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was gendar@@ mer@@ gers . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship of 1974 until 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was born from 1976 to 1978 on the commander of the intelligence department , 141 in the prison of La Per@@ la . &quot;

&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ x@@ os son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and that he said before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows what great power has a parent , and how this child chose a way of redemption . &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo , and asked me to identify my boyfriend . &quot;
he said :

therefore he offered me to go back to the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
he said to me I would be secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be fine . for so my Father had drawn me up .
on the military base I had to destroy Pap@@ ers who had heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda amat@@ k , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ da dr@@ es the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me a total of four times after La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he made me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he commanded me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small in a ceiling , wrapped up and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day , I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke where the stolen items have been removed , and held me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; I sp@@ ying in , and saw a couch that were tor@@ tured on men . &quot;
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ springs .
later I found out that they attached to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was just captiv@@ ated there .
&quot; it is rarely a person with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ cast it with water and def@@ endants him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the rock was inside there was irre@@ plac@@ eable ... like a fil@@ thy wind .
&quot; years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell immediately and told me it became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible only that a person can do so much suffering from another ?
I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he carried me at the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked men lying with the face down - all were at hand and feet .
near the entrance k@@ au@@ ded people quietly to the mattresses .
&quot; when my father noted that I saw the prisoner , he said , &quot; What gu@@ est thou so , Ar@@ sch@@ hole ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you hear me otherwise ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my father told me at home .
beside La cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms that were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there a man and killed .
&quot; ( according to the survivors of the Civil Society , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who also was indicted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , was indicted by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former Fol@@ der chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way you came here , is also the way where the kidn@@ apping came here . &quot;
&quot; when looking at the map , see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured it for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here , their names were changed and they got a number assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were cast into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order of the top came , that they should be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - the Euph@@ em@@ ism - for the deportation of the people and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War of war &apos;
my Father brought all kinds of stolen things with home .
&quot; at that time at age I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; - how they called it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was later on the military , I was in gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs that one assumes an enemy that one fought . &quot;

&quot; but when you go into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then that is not a war of war , but V@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I always asked myself how my father , the leader of the security forces , was able to do with this V@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
&quot; I was also officers in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie , and I would never like to inv@@ ade into a house and to ste@@ al it all in it . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal and I answered , And thou that thou curse me on the road ? &quot;
you are not a crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded against anger , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; when you go so far , then I will find you and put you on hand . &quot;
we do not need anyone else !
this was my father .
I have no only good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of that time , on which I carried a jacket and a wheelchair pul@@ pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home . &quot;
&quot; then I accused the defense , a fellow @-@ conspir@@ e in this crime . I res@@ isted , no problem , they can lay me on what they wanted . &quot;
anyway I was there to dissoci@@ ate .
&apos;@@ the fusion of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ ous act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I find repentance . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you have children , you can recognize the value of a life . &quot;
one develops and realize that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have ex@@ ited from the dictatorship during the dictatorship . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children do not lead ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
she was like our pet almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
&quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could have put it into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but what their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
did these people not also have families who were handed over to their mortal remains ?
the ti@@ ghtening of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act that you can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was introduced again , they hol@@ ed machines to eliminate the remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were ex@@ hor@@ ted and somewhere escap@@ es - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my Father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals - among them my dad .
&quot; the thought to indicate my father was built during a conversation , when he stood under house arrest . &quot;
I made him accus@@ ations about all of the atro@@ cities which I had to experience with him .
&quot; then he said , &quot; &quot; I do not know . I have not killed anybody . &quot;
&quot; I felt un@@ folded and asked me , why the whole exagger@@ ated patriot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; western and Christian feelings &quot; , &quot; which they supposedly defended , were really good . &quot;
then I scre@@ am :
how can you tell us what to tell me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed horrible crimes and you have forced me to be a child to participate .
&quot; he only rep@@ lied , &quot; &quot; Na b@@ ye me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
in 2010 I posted the first ad .
&quot; finally , I had finally recognized that he was a criminal . &quot;
nobody can imagine that I have been taken up . I finally have said against my own father .

the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the northern part of the judgment .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial ended up between March 1975 and December 1978 crimes against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the court pro@@ filed in 28 cases of life sti@@ ckers , and in nine cases of prison sentence between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there was free trial . &quot;

&quot; a translation mistake makes older people in Kyoto , &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation errors in a center in Kyoto , in which one can extend his guides . &quot;
the photo was spread in social media .
arrangement of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can prolong its driving licence , in the last month a very special ab@@ used translation . &quot;
&quot; on a shield , the Japanese word was placed in Sirius ( kor@@ ei@@ ghs sh@@ a ) , the &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; means mis@@ understand@@ ably - maybe even with a arches , &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; as &quot; fear@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the false translation was available from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
processing of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine was often shared in the social media .
&quot; the fault was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os , who made it aware of the local time . &quot;
the Kyoto daily newspaper S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto , &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation has been removed first . the term &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the proper term &quot; El@@ der &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of Pre@@ fecture , Kyoto ap@@ olog@@ ised for the translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had been reviewed by the translator and that the translation has not been reviewed to verify its correctness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are sincerely sorry that older people felt by insufficient correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News put something more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older motor@@ ists in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; aw@@ fully &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an appropriate description of older motor@@ ists . according to the police there are the proportion of older motor@@ ists who are involved in nationwide accidents , but quite occasion for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture , for example , were caused in 2005 1.@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 4@@ 60 accidents of seniors . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , seniors 1,@@ 8@@ 03 caused by a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
thus their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased altogether , the proportion of the elderly caused by the elderly has risen in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the name not named Reporter was published in the Yahoo published version of the article comments on the light , which show the prejudices some Japanese apparently against older motor@@ ists : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo on the translation errors , among other things , was given the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; so faul@@ ty is the translation really not , or ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I do not find that it is a real translation mistake . &quot;
there are no few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia
translation errors are widely used in Japan and across Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true discovery for these bizarre errors in English .
photo of Flickr users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; for passage , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the text text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is the case with native language . generally , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - maternity language . &quot;
&quot; this is how a French mother@@ language translate into French , for example from English to French - not from French to English . &quot;
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies employ no employees with English as a mother tongue , translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding for survival , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers , to learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies that even do not have foreign employees , have translations yet to be completed . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best to be done - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; wor@@ r@@ alled and pu@@ zz@@ ling phrases that arise through machine translation , show that this technique can hardly be replaced by human translators for a long time . &quot;
&quot; some of the strange English wor@@ dings in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , often used as t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo of Flickr users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless . however , by large companies or the government that have the resources to ensure higher standards can be carefully checked . &quot;
the city Kyoto uses a serious source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ ored measures on the Internet and television reach
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ elan Internet users used to have no access to the online radio station Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV were no longer available . &quot;
&quot; other online transm@@ itter transm@@ its recordings of the protests in Car@@ acas , which were organized by op@@ position@@ ists , who oppose the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests began beginning April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s responsibilities to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the link is cool@@ ed , and recommended the U@@ sians , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# cens@@ orship : activated your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages Venezu@@ elan providers are locked again .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the vene@@ ers with Internet access , especially in times of distur@@ ban@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been hesit@@ ant about protests in 2014 . at that time , the Commission held responsible for telecommunications to them with funds and lock@@ ers if they continue to report on demonstrations as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I have registered myself at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this is still cheaper than to buy two lit@@ res of Lim@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ IT filter confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible through a block of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also concerns the website , on which the National Assembly bears its meetings . &quot;
&quot; earlier research institutes of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that the local internet provider are currently using DNS . this is a technique that will respond to specific domains requests from certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a web page is blocked by the DNS , the server responds or deny the request at the call of such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; with V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transfer was hired on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman Elvis Flor@@ es , who was in custody the protests in Car@@ acas . &quot;
Flor@@ es was be@@ aten while he was in a police level .
&quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to broadcast . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the Government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : this makes the vene@@ ers access to multi@@ medi@@ al coverage about the actual events in the country ever more difficult . &quot;
in Paraguay a lot of girls will get to slave to receive education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house in which she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina fights for the rights of children and collect testimonies of other Cri@@ adi@@ ta , who were exactly as they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the shortened version of a report , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ ed cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices from Latin America . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , where she was not working together with the family who lived there . &quot;
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; the , from which something has become &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as cri@@ adi@@ ta , one calls in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money passes their under@@ age son or her inferi@@ or daughter to another , richer family . in exchange the child will receive food , training and roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; what does not mention , however , is that the children must do countless days of house work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse may be - and all that within the framework of a treaty which you can not lift up . &quot;
this is widely used as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice in Paraguay on the basis of participation and acceptance by large sections of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
&quot; after completing their studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization dedicated to the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ ta , especially young girls affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered testimonies , researched and denoun@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things on behalf of name , because the sense of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated to the Cri@@ adi@@ ta in general , is guaranteed to be silent in general . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double del@@ usion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , who is her daughter in faith , that she is able to complete their education , improve their position in society , and &quot; &quot; can do something out of itself &quot; , &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the faith that they would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be star@@ ving . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mis@@ used , his family will only experience many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never learn about it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the hitherto unknown phenomenon occurred in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú in hospital , her body showed traces of fierce bat . shortly thereafter she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former Mil@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an official assistant at the office .
&quot; Mar@@ ín was living with them in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira proposed a stick to Mar@@ ín until they suffered deadly injury . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of young girls .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made deep @-@ rooted practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s practice for the death of the girl .
it signed the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest demonstrations together and demanded that there are no other Carolina to give in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows as children registered , &quot; compl@@ ained Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
without papers it is much easier to un@@ punished the rights of children .
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbors of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a rapid investigation into the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment .
&quot; if the case occurs before judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín will be pioneering - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is coming to justice . &quot;
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ ta tas will not only be exploited as man@@ power , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , sign up the course and her father lost his work . &quot;
their brothers had to now all work and began selling on the street or on the market sweets to make money .
but they went all further to school .
only Tina was sent as cri@@ adi@@ ta into the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
at the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time so that you still have time to learn . &quot;
she stood up to five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared breakfast for their employer .
&quot; Friday for example clean@@ se them the fridge , pl@@ ast@@ ed the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
when the school was at an end she went home again and had time to learn .
&quot; the more they were done by learning , the more free time it had . &quot;
but even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , she had never had star@@ ving , but did not get unlimited food . &quot; &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord than food from the fridge , &quot; &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 until 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some evenings of the households Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , to stand beside him and editorial from Op@@ position@@ ings such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them to convince the reports of the official media on the regime of dict@@ ators .
&quot; he held it for intelligent , but did not hold her with her . &quot; the landlord had found someone who heard about politics while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; she allowed me not often to visit my family because they were in mind that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which would be back to the indigenous group of the Guaran@@ i , at home again their native Guaran@@ i . &quot;
&quot; they feared that they had the formation they had allowed to lose , they explained . &quot;
&quot; however , her was totally clear that she had gotten for everything she got from them , with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; also in the school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken , bullying and the ra@@ ils are exposed to the Cri@@ adi@@ ta if they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that anyone who has no parents , is a cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I could not invite anybody to my home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , at the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly distinc@@ tly that I was not part of a group . &quot;
&quot; isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
the Society granted the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman released the following text in a Facebook group where you can share vac@@ ation@@ ally for cleaning personnel and n@@ anny in Paraguay . &quot;

please report to you .
&quot; starting on Monday , if possible . &quot;
the display has five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a miserable girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
&quot; the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the inland , which wants to work . &quot;
then the inter@@ viewer in the display is once again a :
&quot; dear girl@@ friends , I have found one . I look if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again if something is . &quot;
the store was completed .
&quot; in the pro@@ log to report Cri@@ adi@@ ta , ¿ H@@ ast@@ a cu@@ án@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ adi@@ ta &apos;s Crete , How long still ? ) , a collection of testimonies of former Cri@@ adi@@ ta , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history , we managed to deny systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay , in which the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores had been subjected to their &quot; wives , &quot; and the natives of the Men@@ s@@ ú ( where the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores ) had to come into a system of slavery , in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation . &quot;
the social inequality in Paraguay and the vision of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
legisl@@ ations writing Egyptian and social media to register with the government

sixty Egyptian Parliam@@ ents have recently agreed a bill for &quot; regulations regarding the use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; when he is accepted by the Parliament , commercial and user can register social media in Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , then a place would be set up , which is in charge of using citizens and to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with the adoption of the law , beneficiaries and users must register on the site of the site with their right names and staff members to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it is failed to do so , this could be a penalty of up to six months in prison or a w@@ ager with them . &quot;
&quot; the bill &apos;s draft which consists of six Par@@ ag@@ ra@@ fen and cur@@ ated in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which runs and used over the Internet to communicate with others through voice , video , and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law will be enforced when the draft is not assumed , as the draft authorities are not suggest@@ ing how Egyptian authorities are not able to register the registration , which does not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ar , Parliament &apos;s parliament@@ arians and sponsors of the legislative situation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user names and users received a username and a password to come through the fire@@ wall to block the Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean Egypt is planning to judge a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . on the basis of those , it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known so far that such plans do exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical regarding the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist , the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I have strongly doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they can be inter@@ acting , physical public and private spaces , it could also control it online . &quot;
&quot; take it seriously , this means that they will establish a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not . and that means a mad system to monitor the activities of the people and also to lead them into a judicial process . &quot;
this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the legislative Parliament and the constitutional committees , before it goes into the plenary session . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is consistent with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ izes and safegu@@ ar@@ ded that no ab@@ err@@ ation of an@@ ration on the screen is present &quot; , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MPs ruled Tam@@ ar El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ wy proposed a legal situation against cy@@ ber crime in which a li@@ felong sentence for those intended to be found guilty to threaten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest . &quot; &quot;
how to protect a Kurdish nature of the Persian leop@@ ards in the war in Iraq

high up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north @-@ east of Iraq work the wel@@ far@@ ists of H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq to protect the gh@@ ost Persian leop@@ ards .
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of leop@@ ards who strip with Africa and Asia belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sa@@ x@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of its habitat and since they find fewer and less boot@@ y . &quot;
why is this specific type of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; how R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; the Persian leop@@ ard is the only remaining beast of the Kurdish ecosystem . &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on that a big car@@ ni@@ b is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ards actually is low in the wild wild and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore shows that they have a shot of a big cat in the cam@@ el , r@@ aza breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained Bi@@ olog@@ in , R@@ aza is passionate about another side of their country , which is not only of war and conflict . &quot;
it has been involved in the field studies of wild animals and educational programs for six years and has been involved in educational programs of Nature Iraq .
it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to creating the zones for wild animals in the Kurdistan region .

&quot; at the beginning of March 2017 , docum@@ enting the progress made for the Nor@@ theast of Japan , the progress made for the North @-@ east of Japan . a tremendous earthquake , a Tsun@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the disaster . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a et@@ aker &apos;s pre@@ fecture in Japan northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring villages of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to ev@@ acu@@ ate because the ts@@ un@@ ami had fallen whole coastal cities from the map .
&quot; even in addition , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture had an atomic accident , already alone because of that , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses . &quot;
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows the progress six years after that progress has been reached in order to re @-@ rebuild the local communities .
the detailed report of the paper includes both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of those concerned themselves .
&quot; housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reported that by December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare houses ( Cent@@ uries ) , , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ch@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ tures was Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima is laid down by 70 percent of the final light . &quot;
&quot; however , one always makes every effort to re @-@ ev@@ acu@@ ate six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated from Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ ac@@ shel@@ ters ( IV ) , cas@@ et@@ su it@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in homes . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such accommodation units . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 per cent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 per cent of ev@@ acu@@ ated , who were home after disaster in homes , were settled in final houses . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is here by 34 percent . &quot;
the state of works and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ tures .
&quot; as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by the disaster , opened their doors to December 2016 , which constitutes nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; six years later , industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fecture is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 percent of the fisher@@ y in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation again , at Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of the fisher@@ y have resum@@ ed their operations . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have attracted large @-@ scale in the three pre@@ fecture of agricultural land . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i managed to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of arable land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of agricultural arable land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima again . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a result of the nuclear failure , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of agricultural arable land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are located in the &quot; nuclear wave zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ tures , tourism has recovered , but again Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains be@@ aten . &quot;
&quot; the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ates are again at 90 percent at the same level as before disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima however , here , can only have 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it &apos;s harder to earn their living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; to determine an overall picture , the newspaper led numerous surveys under the native population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ated . she asked her about the status of re@@ building and also how their rebellion has changed to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
in her introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey in order to get more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness under the native population .
&quot; the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of the respon@@ dents find that still not enough in cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention has not been done . &quot;
how it stands for those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ated the Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture .
&quot; in their edition to the anniversary of the earthquake , Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also strengthened its attention on the position of ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima not only had to experience the enormous earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , disastrous , atomic accident , the Japan had ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were moved outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 there were some more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after 2017 , we still live 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima off their home pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in the cat@@ astro@@ phen@@ ols areas , most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated areas are fewer than 50 years old . they have failed to bring efforts to rebuild the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . here it is construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games to be held in Tokyo . &quot;
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people encounter people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences appear to be greater than the similarities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more links than it seems at first glance . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely to these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected to someone over language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he gathered in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care station : last Friday he had struck him a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nationwide travelled millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest race against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated him on this Saturday and now have taken him into an artificial coma .
its condition is regarded as critical .
&quot; the local gallery of Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread across Brazil within a few days . &quot;
&quot; on the pictures , the face of the police officer is also identified , which attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police held in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás , that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident from active service . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers how he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his war@@ stock on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
would a police officer be@@ aten by a prot@@ esters and land on the intensive care station would be able to see his face six months on television and the whole repression would be justified .
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; , a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video published by Lu@@ iz da Luz , divided by Lu@@ iz as Luz , where you see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several san@@ itation shortly afterwards to him . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective is filmed in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below is one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users now donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to be part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás experiencing a wave of political force : here , the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father because he was ex@@ iled the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools , and here we have been attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked by a poli@@ cem@@ an , who has struck him with a stroke . &quot;
police attacks
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only State in Brazil where he came to brutal police officers on the past Friday .
&quot; police officers set up on protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where prot@@ esters had built a stage for speakers , rubber @-@ sh@@ utter and tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the MEP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via speaker say on violence against prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ der de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media road prot@@ ection@@ ery by putting the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a shut@@ down . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S.@@ Paulo and Est@@ ado de S.@@ Paulo deliberately reported a zer@@ bro@@ w glass window to make an illustr@@ ative picture with a photo their front pages illustr@@ ative .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a set in fire . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic cause , more about a broken window size than about the protests of thousands of people who serve to defend a special thing . &quot;
this one has to acknowledge that if you are strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; also here the term &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; is an absurd , dis@@ proportionate meaning , and the typical force of military police are protected by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters in confron@@ ting &quot; with the police . &quot;
the un@@ indu@@ str@@ alization of forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar@@ s fabri@@ cated in the whole of Cuba the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the Western Cub@@ an Province May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - at Spanish sugar mill - regardless of it that there is no note@@ worthy sugar @-@ harvest . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were put in the sugar fabri@@ cated factories .
&quot; after the ground@@ work , the sugar cane industry was silent in the region , and the factory lost gradually and after its installations , until just the smells of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 2@@ 72 workers had to be re @-@ inv@@ ent .
some changes the work .
&quot; others res@@ ellers , and com@@ mu@@ te every day to the factories that have still gr@@ ind . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veteran , which is open every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry did not smoke his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the region of sugar fabri@@ cated , they have been in operation after a long in@@ active time because they were received . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene remembers precisely that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would get the sugar@@ s factory would be preserved but the promise has not been kept .
&quot; the sugar cane industry already resistance the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market price , the in@@ effici@@ encies , the poor administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced . &quot;
a few decades ago the message would have been a motive for alarm for the country but the bad harvest has already been no new one .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar@@ s industry joined ?
the old railway station of the church saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economical necessity : the 155 replacing sugar@@ s fabri@@ cated were technically outdated , and hardly competitive they became un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production goal was 4 million tons . &quot;
they left only the factories to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives led to such measures were the poor productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; however , the sugar price increased from about a decade back . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 through 20@@ 25 the price of irregular sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2013 report &quot; &quot; agricultural perspectives &quot; &quot; of the OECD and FAO , the UN and Food Organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tons ) , the gross export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from there , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the lac@@ tation period came from a total of 98 sugar@@ s fabri@@ cation , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar@@ ru@@ hr@@ fabrik Greg@@ orio Arl@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked since 1967 in the factory .
&quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closing of the factory , the word he is repeated the most , &quot; fraud . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be tac@@ kled .
&quot; in order to get the place , it constituted a full time - working group . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially written documents , which could be removed only regarding the parts that would be removed , the addres@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ m Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could take any acceptance . &quot;
&quot; from there on , the responsibility was over@@ loaded and the letters were more and more frequent . &quot;
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the nursing factory two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the remaining sugar fabri@@ cation .
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was against his will at the lac@@ tation of the factory , whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work@@ station was eliminated .
&quot; in many cases , no alternatives for the work@@ ings and services provided in the con@@ gregations were created , in which they were created . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech from 21 October 2002 , the then president looked into the eyes of the present people , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories have been no longer in operation for five years . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar mills
since 2004 sugar cane is only extracted high by the parliamentary elections .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years the people of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al I learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar factory closed , or better said , when they began to interfere , they also listened to , the road to paved , this also disadvantaged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced old age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot;
they were made to spare parts .
&quot; without a future perspective , many young people left the region too . &quot;
a food factory was created in the area whose production serves not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant continues imposing .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
&quot; Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty reviews bring the old soldiers an ann@@ u@@ ent of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month , to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich . &quot;
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a subsequent person , yet he gives the lies , which one told him , not . &quot;
they tor@@ ment him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes with 65 years in R@@ ente , not because it is lack of power , but because he is bitter . &quot;

&quot; the workshop is increasing that the young participants in interviews like &quot; cultural identity , speech , engagement , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever has always been found in the sense . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youth are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells the story of the Highway 16 , also called &quot; highway of tears &quot; , at which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite influences by globalization is .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people have not always dominate the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the refrain is sung in Cre@@ e . &quot;
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hi@@ p Hop group who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in dialect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
&quot; at the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ side of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the st@@ rop@@ he is available in writing , as well a translation into English that is translated here into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in myself
but I try to go on my days on earth
this is the day when you will take our cry
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will rise up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and lead to our youth as well
this is how they can do what they determined by the Creator .
&quot; in commentary , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also has a contribution and adds the st@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ en@@ cap@@ tions ( which is also published on his blog ) : &quot;
in Japan plastic meals are not only shown in the restaurant
&quot; plastic meals ( above all , known ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot;

in Japan you can see in front of almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , are exhibited in the proximity of the entrance sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( in the column ) , &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tic models of dishes &quot; &quot; ) of each food that is served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers watch these plastic meals and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic meals .
&quot; in the to@@ ki@@ er district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there are a variety of these small businesses that produce even those plastic dishes , which was documented by the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese people , these plastic meals are so common that they do not even find out more of them . however , a new trend is turning into con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous phone accessories and other gadgets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published series of Social Media Links and Photos , which show this unusual twist with the sho@@ ve san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in special sale : new with plastic stores decorated mobile @-@ tapes , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been transformed to kit@@ sch@@ y gathering objects , as in this case , refriger@@ ation @-@ magnets : &quot;
here are a few sho@@ cks of refriger@@ ation magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo station .
the new boom of the Essen@@ ti@@ fications is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel shell with seafood ) is transformed into a cell phone .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as mobile @-@ sticks .
also this part we made for the exhibition at Tokyo .
and here is an apple that solidi@@ fies your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to see like an apple , with a candle for mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is only the beginning of an increasing dock .
&quot; some cell phones and mobile phone designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or salmon @-@ o@@ estrogen is used , a popular plate , which is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can put my cell phone with salmon @-@ o@@ estrogen ? &quot;
I believe I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic stores can also take a less appe@@ tizing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant . &quot;
our newest cell @-@ handed has the shape of mel@@ on ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; further sk@@ ur@@ le plastic meals can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter using the h@@ ash@@ tag # , in the US $ 200 . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , dedicated to the Bel@@ ie@@ fer@@ ment of the restaurant industry . as for example with the sho@@ ve san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic meals are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers , &quot;

&quot; in reports in foreign and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; &quot; fight against drug trade &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the suspi@@ cion and fat@@ alities regularly appear in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy which brings this fight with them . &quot;
&quot; reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ hal@@ a @-@ cart@@ el , urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background . &quot;
&quot; the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the trau@@ ma or the churches that have learned to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; there are behind any cor@@ pse , behind each bone fund in the hundreds of secret tombs , the stories paid by their parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds might never heal . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico introduced the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug trade life ) , which aims to give these victims a voice and told the stories of people who were involved in the struggle between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organized crime can not only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for example , if shops close , because they are threatened by drug dealers and so whole churches have to drive a lot of kilometers to buy something as much as milk . &quot;
pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ er@@ p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; as anxiety life changed &quot; ) just tells these stories .
&quot; one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who is secretly seeking every weekend tombs after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost their father in just one day , her father and two sisters , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; priest : as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again for the purpose that we have put forward , go and go to graves after the people we loved to seek . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never returned . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
there is also my mother who is here with me too .
at the moment it does not have income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but that does not get them off , because they require a death certificate . &quot;
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we do not only have to show the faces of those who are afraid of fear . we have to show the conflicts of international community , dis@@ br@@ otherhood and governance . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminded us that violence should never be considered as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have known disease and sensation journ@@ alism I have been known for some years now .
I &apos;m passing each day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the title pages with pictures that actually only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from files of experts .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who disgu@@ sted or sad . it seems like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be in@@ different with it or consider this as normal .
it writes on :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year old C@@ ousin thinks he is Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if it is great . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of offen@@ ders if they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me it is that , as if they rot@@ ate those who have lost anyone and those who fear that they have happened so something too . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories are blo@@ ating numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of men is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students can be justified in a neighbourhood so that they were &quot; &quot; shopping cart &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to engage themselves , that they remain spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies if they are not stir@@ ring and quiet . &quot;
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; four months of black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family with threats has been lo@@ oted out for month to money from their business until they were destroyed not only the business but also their family had to be torn apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain on it never passes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes again high if you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed and phone numbers too .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are removed from each other , the better . &quot;
she included her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will dec@@ eive you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days if wines would solve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answers is no , because I forgot how you were crying . I have to learn to live with pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one by force posted generation .
in the introduction he asks questions about how : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was killed by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a guard and he tells that he himself had to teach himself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tor@@ tillas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
&quot; but they are insignificant compared to pain in his eyes - in@@ speak@@ able for a boy for all the life of violence , and had to learn to live with it . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he said that his mother disappeared . &quot;
&quot; but this was not the day , in which his childhood ended . &quot;
&quot; his childhood had already gone over two years before , when he only saw a few blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father saw that was shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez saw this out : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence through organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of people based on civil security and government of the United States government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s office is 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the average of 8.5 Mor@@ ds per day . &quot;
these are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of thousands who have organised crime in Mexico and enter the country &apos;s soul .
only few stories are still living in the face of new head@@ lines . this project reminds us of those we must not forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; , &quot; &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 , whose aim consists of depic@@ ting the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trade , which has tor@@ tured the country in the last four decades , in an intel@@ li@@ gible form . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flickr users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this article and the pages on which it is linked , contain images , on which violence is represented . &quot;
&quot; the fact check is important in a moment in which it is about to lift up a rum@@ or , or fal@@ si@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; but what is the years after doing something the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , tends to persist . &quot;
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it was mis@@ leading to use trage@@ dies that actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false copying of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in terminology by Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - denied not the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures on messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank @-@ car park the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ cked around and explo@@ ded . here 230 people came to live . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths full of perc@@ ussions that were difficult to drive . &quot;
this was caused by the petrol truck to the victim .
&quot; administration officials described a fire@@ ball , the d@@ utz@@ lig@@ ador@@ ned houses , including a movie nearby , which was full of people who illumin@@ ate the soccer championship . &quot;
houses gro@@ omed and shortened cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to im@@ mortality .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ users My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 2015 Multi@@ key photos of the incident form the gray scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
&quot; it shows rows of stolen bodies , which are winding on the ground while individuals are viewing . &quot;
but here the story does not find its end .
&quot; over the years the same photo has been applied several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but not in the context of the trage@@ dies , particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remot@@ est Nig@@ erian loc@@ alities B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ov@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically of atro@@ cities before they forced to flee .
houses and stores were burned down and cor@@ pse plants in roads and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; the figures could not yet be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one was left to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; said one citizen to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many have been sc@@ atter@@ ing , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the following time could be displayed exemplary . &quot;
&quot; the occasion for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army @-@ profit point in B@@ aga was a permanent state of conflict between the Military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt at B@@ oko Har@@ am to gain land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here , the picture from the DR Congo has emerged as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this mis@@ used use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ cre@@ tions ; Africa check has documented as@@ agen@@ das to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all of these cases , the picture was presented as proof of mass@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; one step further , personal comments such as this example deri@@ ving the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments . &quot;
the image from San@@ ge also entered in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning release , published by the United Nations described those who could flee beats , rape and several deaths , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts , like the following , which summar@@ ized this description with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from a Saudi @-@ Arab news page , which was mis@@ diagnosed in 2012 , the President of mar@@ s Th@@ an being told , monks and politicians were involved in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to gather this information . &quot;
&quot; the original post , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organisations that AF@@ P had as their source of acquain@@ tan@@ ces , had also mis@@ diagnosed Th@@ an being this statement , but did not get the picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false coupling have gone back to the years 2011 and 2012 and come from anywhere around the world .
&quot; using a &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; , &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot;
&quot; an up@@ returned picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 18.@@ 8 billion images ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the said picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixed mask of private pages , platforms of social media and community , as well as national publications and are in many different languages like English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek , and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have passed wrong reports , united , others have tried to expose the counterf@@ eit@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; we have compiled examples of the mis@@ used use and brought them in contact with the respective countries , based on which side they were published . thus , we want to represent the range more visible than by the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also connected ) , several examples can be used for mis@@ used use . &quot;
here are some cases that can now be ra@@ ined completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news Fr@@ ames .
countries of false v@@ entures of the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; the orange colored countries point out on pages or servers , over the examples of counterf@@ eit@@ s or fal@@ cons are still available . &quot;
&quot; the countries in Gray are examples , which are available according to met@@ adata and information that are available about Tin@@ Eye , probably also counterf@@ eit examples . &quot;
&quot; the memory , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo has been posted in an online discussion forum ( directed at Algeri@@ an and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread on the &quot; war of Buddh@@ ists against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Canada , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in this post , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City is not just the wrong feedback , but also discussed the abuse of the picture from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies in the DR Congo and beyond . &quot;
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los Cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( In Nigeria they burn the Christians ) .
&quot; in this article about explo@@ sions in North @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ blica , the city district is identified as the Christian part of the town . &quot;
&quot; La Rep@@ ú@@ blica cited as its source the Spanish news agency , which is not known whether the original report contained the image ) . &quot;
&quot; France , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; during the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this one here , who used the picture from the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; have clearly seen no pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster which resist this . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the faul@@ ty use of the image since 2011 in connection with Nigeria , at that time promoted by a post of US American , anti@@ Islamic comment@@ ator Pam@@ ela G@@ eller . &quot;

&quot; this article goes out on the continuous hard@@ ship of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar , but quoted the work of an article of the Indian Express with the image from the DR Congo , the article of the Indian Express had not included the publication of our contribution in this image . &quot;

this page used the image as a proof that Muslims killed the Nig@@ erian Christians .
this statement was rejected by a Greek factor check @-@ page 2013 and once again in 2016 .
&quot; Iran , 2012 . &quot;
a member of the students of theology ( mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used to illustrate the image of DR Congo .
&quot; Italy , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; a resident of the old@@ town partly Pie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o from Tr@@ ento po@@ sted this message to his side , in order to express its solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Nigeria , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo has been a test@@ ament to the bombing of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion . &quot;
Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme example of an ab@@ used use of the DR Congo , on the one hand a twe@@ et , the sympathy with the Nig@@ erian massage , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ g@@ gers , the claims , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are tr@@ acked , too delicate , since the photos of them were mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the government of Myanmar published a means of conception of what she referred to as &quot; inten@@ tional fin@@ alist News and Photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments in trying to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this approach , which appeared exclusively in English , also includes references to counterf@@ eit images of smells , the H@@ ate Spe@@ ech , and used by extrem@@ ist groups to put forward that Muslims Buddh@@ ists kill and go into the other ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;
&quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot; &quot; F@@ p@@ ens &quot; &quot; ф@@ т@@ и &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; ix &quot; &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ ophobia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) . &quot;
&quot; this post , directed to members of the Russian Orthodox Church , shows that the image of the DR Congo are NOT Muslims shows Christians to kill . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 &quot;
this news page asser@@ ted that the President of Myanmar has been vac@@ ated in 2012 that monks and politicians had been involved in the kill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story with the image of San@@ ge .
&quot; the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication , the picture continues to be included in it . &quot;
Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article by 2014 about students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly stated that the picture was not taken by the kill@@ ings but it claims that it was a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the picture later related to the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am of 2015 in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to resist that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the image of the DR Congo emerged with this t@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and del@@ etes a discussion among Muslims after the 1982 massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities found this kind of events , the mut@@ in@@ ous in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was recorded as proof of the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ et@@ et ) , but the messages that were associated with it were attacked in no religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the goal was to draw attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that was supposedly being dra@@ fted by a &quot; &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; over the Nig@@ erian massacre , put it discussion like this here in Vietnamese , and said it to fal@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; from the message which was contained in the picture from the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of an incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the cap in Gray ) , Tin@@ Eye also points out , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamp exist on the web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and un@@ locking them have image names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original item from 2010 , the picture eventually carries a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
&quot; there are two strong themes or frames ( ir@@ radiation ) , who go through these posts . the first frame is focused on religion . &quot;
the photo was used in terms of greater discussion about the silence in connection with the off@@ ences of Christians through Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the mur@@ ders of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Buddh@@ ists .
a second fr@@ aming is used to discuss how a African life is rated in comparison to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth investigate how images can be used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe this pictures any longer . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who have un@@ inten@@ tionally share the water to practice the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggest this mood of failed and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and decorate it the real atro@@ city of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of rap@@ h pictures has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that rejection of images of a ref@@ usal to acknowledge the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
&quot; at the same time , the concern that violent images of readers and viewers des@@ ensi@@ tizing and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , study , how violent media work to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss with rap@@ sing representations in the news media , fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experiment , because with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you will have to thoroughly consider the situation in which an image is somewhat sug@@ ary , which actually devi@@ ates from context or to completely mis@@ used species . &quot;
&quot; however , any investigation of false grants should be considered as internationally they can . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqueness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons used in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. , uns@@ ur@@ able ) attempts to offer language fans a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all . &quot;
such words are available in each language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these uns@@ ur@@ passed words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese su@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly to each attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; one word or expression does not suff@@ ice , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context is needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a long time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and Lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the M@@ w@@ ot@@ - language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , as : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k - salute you to your parents in recognition of how to have tried you in your recent years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ z@@ iness , which you feel after going on cold days in the sun . &quot;
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog About :
&quot; they compensated other cultures , revealing other thought @-@ cat@@ ches and wake up our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site to show more of these &quot; un@@ brid@@ geable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; , which are highly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite pictures here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is surrounded by the worst fl@@ ut@@ ational catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently looking forward to the worst high water and yield disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by mon@@ soon , which normally ends at the end of May , are crossed by strong rainf@@ alls the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts on the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; according to an opinion of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic centre of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people are missing because of the flight and mud . &quot;
over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 30@@ 4 safe living places .
&quot; the rainf@@ all left on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the waterfalls in some areas went slowly . &quot;
health and hygiene dis@@ proportion@@ ality of the population constitute a massive challenge to the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flu@@ ence disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water is up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lan@@ kan deadly floods the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ ery crisis , warns Save the Children after more rainf@@ alls are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; today tomorrow , Nel@@ u@@ wa &apos;s bus was located in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded because of the last granted water @-@ bird of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Air Force has five planes for rescue operations , and another five are made for transportation of emergency supplies for the residents included in their flooded villages . &quot;
also various organizations and star@@ tu@@ ps have been prepared to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tory in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high water conditions and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and b@@ ail@@ out dr@@ ones need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
for those who want to don@@ ate food and life @-@ necessary goods for high @-@ water offering -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 in case you need help in this area .
&quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app , so that the cat@@ astro@@ oph@@ et centre will be informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the catastrophe of the Tro@@ pen@@ sturb@@ ate Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me led a &quot; high water aid &quot; button , which allowed it users to call a vehicle for picking up assistance and donations . these were then passed on to the s@@ ri@@ lan@@ k Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; also , they led a &quot; &quot; S@@ OS &quot; &quot; button which had more than thousand requests and 150 successful jet@@ ting actions for floo@@ ding and black@@ out actions introduced by floods . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need of security and provide assistance . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lan@@ kan is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;
Muslims that you cannot see
the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of the Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
&quot; using Pro@@ ig@@ t.@@ Dam@@ as in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour in and dear friend . &quot;
&quot; I trust her my four year old daughter , she trust me her children ; she is my rock in the br@@ anding . &quot;
in the one minute we call for slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
&quot; in the next step , we are entitled to transfer rights for transfers . &quot;
&quot; we are located in a sea of rain@@ utes and people , some consider the iconic image of a woman with a head of head , bound up from an American flag , other slo@@ gans against Islam@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; my friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things concern not you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Mus@@ lim@@ a ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led these entertainment .
&quot; people with whom I work or people , who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - of the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their conception . &quot;
they Muslim me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify with it to be Muslim , to different kind . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim dra@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; this dra@@ wer is so well designed in our collective imagination that once Muslims , as I do not fit there , Muslim . &quot;
Muslim will be disp@@ ens@@ ed
I ste@@ h therefore not alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry is best sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures are one in the sense when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when J@@ al@@ alu@@ dd@@ in Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a orthodox Christian pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western idea , the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the reduction of sec@@ tional images of Muslims that have been coloni@@ alist Western books for centuries .
&quot; this temp@@ ting picture is determined by the dark man , whom you should fear and the exotic woman you should save . &quot;
&quot; the groundbreaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid , in the 1970s , laid the story behind these pictures in the 1970s . &quot;
but these pictures are still expanding today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continues . &quot;
&quot; I worked for three years in the news industry for thirteen years , and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ ative will dominate our News@@ fe@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; this fo@@ b sh@@ ado@@ wed the reality that in the last three decades , nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the USA 2016 could not even choose their first female presidential system . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ v fail to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head to@@ wel in public buildings and su@@ ck @-@ Arab , Muslim women forced by their government to cover their entire body , which these are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group exercises its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; this strong scars , Muslim women , the movements for change . &quot;
&quot; it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American land of Afri@@ cans , who were brought here with slave ships . &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this fo@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective imagination such deep and faul@@ ty that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children become the aim of anti @-@ us@@ li@@ mix@@ er attacks and ra@@ ils .
&quot; on the basis of these stories we tell and about the way we tell them , Islam@@ ophobia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
1.7 billion belong to the 1.7 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative to help us understand the world .
and my industry failed to grasp the Nar@@ r@@ v of 1.7 billion .
and we have failed here where seven million Muslims share in the highest degree of &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America .
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African people .
&quot; six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation , which come from 77 countries . &quot;
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my lon@@ ged parents came to live in New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York ; skyscrapers were made possible through the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; back then , when Khan was emerging the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were unavoidable Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now f@@ aded Mus@@ lim@@ a and American ?
&quot; sometimes , if people wonder why I don &apos;t eat por@@ k , I say - instead of mine Muslim recipes , or my hand@@ some pocket records , which Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I jo@@ kes that we do not wear all pocket records with us .
we must also be not the@@ ological expert to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional safety checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who strive to fight widespread lies over Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the current volume of a well @-@ powered Islam@@ ist machine with w@@ ders , thinking tanks and experts for folding information that is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; due to the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , the Islam@@ ism is in more than just a stranger who carries the head of a woman . &quot;
or as the start@@ ling map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the U.S. , see below . &quot;

Islam@@ ism in its ugly forms acc@@ esses our affili@@ ation .
&quot; it acc@@ esses our identity that is so far @-@ reaching , so versatile and diverse that it can be impossible to fit into a dra@@ wer . &quot;

I want to explain that .
&quot; I was born as Mus@@ lim@@ a , but a Mus@@ lim@@ a was born only then in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of an pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; if social scientist describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ li@@ ical faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , my neighbor in the Brand@@ ung see that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that our houses separate . &quot;
she would see the whole ritual with my daughter when I saw her in my arms and her Arab verses to protect the Koran and called Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one can &apos;t see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief is possibly not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow . &quot;
&quot; the grandmother of the author , when she wins an I@@ k@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters at some point in the 1960s . &quot;
use approved .
belonging to my grandmother is the mother &apos;s image with her sisters ; how did she win a competition in Kar@@ achi for decades ago .
&quot; it is the picture of her that I can see in this moment , when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by its ful@@ ler and un@@ finished paintings painted ; and one Kor@@ ans with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and fourteen chapters that can be very agile . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a means to speak the prayers they had said to me , when I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a to be as she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that was founded over the centuries - through a &quot; Empire , &quot; which has founded a company with the name Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tic Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Komp@@ anie , it has a deep meaning to call God , my only Lord . &quot;
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
&quot; belonging means to grow and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my assigned grandfather cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in it , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of Kas@@ h@@ mir@@ s , wept N@@ ana J@@ aan , f@@ aded by his family in India , Kas@@ h@@ mir , family who was not allowed to close his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians whose families , like in my grandfather , of coloni@@ alists have been diver@@ ted , who have shared the Muslim world as at stake . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that during the last two centuries , Europeans have spread all up to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first fli@@ ers bomb was rejected in a century about a Muslim country .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my Grand@@ mother , an intimate , cr@@ ash@@ ish sub@@ tan of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he was the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion people go deep into our unforgettable family rooms ; our un@@ plug@@ ged history .
&quot; it means remembering that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops left over every continent apart from the Antar@@ c@@ tica , went to Iraq in order to chase mass destruction weapons that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried among the ruins of war .
to be an American Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that self @-@ deaths among veter@@ ans have risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means to know that if a tragedy carries out the U.S. and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , which tells the story four times more than a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that four hundred years ago , the first prayer @-@ call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slaves with the name of Bil@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that two hundred years ago an African , Islam@@ ists named Bil@@ ali Muhammad ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought into this country . &quot;
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
&quot; it is the warmth that I sen@@ sing , when people filled the airports in order to fight the Muslim b@@ an . &quot;
&quot; it is the hope that I feel , when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life . &quot;
&quot; to be an American , a pact , a Kas@@ h@@ mir@@ i , a hap@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim Brotherhood and a journalist , represents the inherent interference of our with multiple ties , but to fail to communicate them on others . &quot;
&quot; the cr@@ atic of 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ er , but it is represented in the reduction of du@@ ci@@ d branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged people build on this branch of structural vibrations . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ ism exists in the Muslim Brotherhood , which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama . &quot;
it consists in consistent monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it consists of the immigration officer , which takes a five year old child in g@@ sch@@ elles . &quot;
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders towards people from just the countries it bom@@ bed .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which is largely Arabs and Muslims in the Visi@@ er . &quot;
&quot; these are the wars , which we lead and the bombs which we throw on Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; due to the stories we tell and on account of those we do not tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study with the title A@@ scent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University showed a scientifically accurate picture and god@@ parents , groups on a scale of 1 to 100 on the evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we have to lead
&quot; we are too deeply shown to dis@@ regard the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous prints , which we increase in our news . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to capture our frequently with binary identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; Pod@@ cast lake , S@@ ay &apos;s of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video concerning black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ elo Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , multip@@ ly Muslim authors , and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ese , mus@@ li@@ ically , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;

col@@ lage of the author .
&quot; but I &apos;m concerned due to this difficult global time , in which we are . &quot;
and that moment has consequences that go over to 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is one reason that conspir@@ acies that existed inside the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House . &quot;
they have grown expon@@ entially because Muslims have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ entially , having created the &apos; other &apos; . &quot;
&quot; a few years before , it had not yet existed ; but now they master big areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and history , which I was not aware of how I was so old now , as it is now my daughter , but which today made me a undeni@@ able Muslim Muslim . &quot;
things that I have left here like a bread@@ crum@@ ble track in my speech .
&quot; things that perhaps aw@@ aken memories , for in all the inter@@ sec@@ ts that constitutes our humanity , likes a story , where someone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , con@@ gregations are held at the 8th annual conference on Islam@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred acade@@ my talk about our problems with the &quot; &quot; other &quot; , &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools or which we read in our newspapers . &quot;
poster of the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ side of the Islam Studies Network .
we all need to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell you here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people gathered through the creation of the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; in the public presentation , four decades ago of the Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we must ask ourselves un@@ convenient questions about the role of this , deliberately and consciously to solidi@@ fy the &quot; &quot; other &quot; , &quot; as it is my girlfriend and I bom@@ bed a new future in which we have no president , the chocolate bu@@ g@@ inger@@ bread is far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ ation wants to preserve urban diversity
&quot; tell stories , from Flickr users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a way to connect here and now despite a language barrier with someone ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) the experience of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently , above another initiative of Steven Bird , the un@@ brid@@ geable blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written words , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of big cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already conducted events , the risk that small and not quite as small languages will not be passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the creators of the project apply :
&quot; the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that do not accept diversity , safe spaces , where residents do not have to forget who they are . &quot;
&quot; while listening to it is often related to understanding , &quot; this events instead &quot; means &quot; to listen to , to feel , establish . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stories of stor@@ yt@@ eller will first translate their story in their own language and translate them into English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , they perform their devotion and their representation that the audiences can turn on it . &quot;
they give laughter and emotions as the language no longer be a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows for example a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narr@@ ation for their country . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the Fa@@ bel of the har@@ es and the b@@ abo@@ o in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; after he declared the meaning of his tale , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked , &quot; How is this to be speaking to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide smile , he shares his sense of inclu@@ siveness : &quot;
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling took place in three towns and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can interact with T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico calls for the United States Neu@@ de@@ composition of the sovereign debt
&quot; with the aim of a new inspection of the public debt of Puerto Rico , participating in 72 million US dollars , took part in 72 million US dollars . the march began at the pu@@ zz@@ ling Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
she was called by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ ter@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Civil Front for the Neur@@ examination of the debts ) and the An@@ kom@@ en@@ ical Church Meeting Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the Prin@@ ciples of the re@@ composition of debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos calls for the politicians , ban@@ kers and government authorities who are responsible for debt to be held responsible for their corrupt . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial examination and guidance committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions for appropriate remun@@ eration , which acts in favor of the economy . &quot;
we will be pressed and sup@@ pressed .
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt , which is not its . &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the state of integrated territory of the USA - is suffering from a serious financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy &quot; , &quot; a government independent non @-@ profit organization without party suppliers , with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law of state @-@ responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state of state . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; the measures imposed from outside will be able to risk the participation and conviction of the citizens , to be rejected by the people . &quot;
&quot; the demonstration took the name &quot; &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on the digital culture , which is oriented in Berlin , dedicated to an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , a publishing house produced by called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; finished books within three to five days , las@@ en excerpts from the book cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ dies ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) . &quot;
the book that has been published last year and is available here license @-@ free contains a number of sets that deal with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
&quot; this book wishes to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built , and what the real costs are associated with . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , developers , researchers and authors who have worked on the movements for free knowledge , have worked on page to find out about the fog which surrounds our News@@ fe@@ eds and create something from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer , who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
its name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have not received any information about its current state or location . &quot;
the introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
&quot; seeing how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for its involvement in a free culture , many of us start to think about their own fate , acts and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what have we decided ?
what have we abandoned in this process of time @-@ wise extreme beliefs ?
the Web@@ Develop@@ er for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custody for March 2012 since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and the Ombud@@ sper@@ son N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi reported that the &quot; military police Bas@@ sel reported on the basis of a &quot; &quot; secret &quot; &quot; were taken from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported it was to be contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who presented himself as In@@ sider of Assad &apos;s government and made them aware of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
&quot; however , his place of stay and condition remain unknown . &quot;
&quot; a leading Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in shaping access to the Internet and to expand knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and at the moment the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ sels cultural prototypes predicted the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites of the world , was the cross@@ roads from numerous civilizations and here the Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bas@@ sel could not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS had everything about it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
this strip @-@ train into the digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time of time which will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; however , this project has not yet been able to complete this project . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my whole life with it , of freedom to dream and bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English with even when he was in custody .
&quot; I learned to read English well , write and speak English . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with each one who asked . he taught other incar@@ cer@@ ers to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bas@@ sel opened my door to technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other incar@@ nations as they use computers , at least theoretically , without having actually held one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a pro@@ sab@@ otage , which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody . &quot;
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura worked together in the book for one year .
&quot; she sm@@ iled the lyrics to him , when she visited him , and he translated it from the Arabian into English . &quot;
the book is license @-@ free available .
book of Youssef N@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a by the title &quot; It takes place :
it happens during every visit ;
&quot; that I have vers@@ ed in the world of your charming eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose ste@@ aling at the moment , in which we embrace you , &quot;
that any of the dangers no matter is ;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guardian &quot;
I forget the thr@@ ong of the prison
&quot; and I go into every detail of your voice , and words &quot;
which I carry with my passion
if your eyes do not have to say
and I let another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I will turn back to my lon@@ eliness , &quot;
to take all the moments returned ?
and for your absence to cry and smile .
I persu@@ ading myself that I will return soon ...
the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bas@@ sel wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :
&quot; a year goes by , my soul &quot;
while at the same time
&quot; I in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ sels history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of protests 2011 against the regime Bashar al @-@ Assad , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) have disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people . &quot;
&quot; those who were arrested or swal@@ lowed by the regime by the regime , were tor@@ tured or even executed . &quot;
&quot; until 2016 , since 2011 , the International Human Rights Association Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in custody . &quot;
the stories of many other people are unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
we repeat our demand today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : because of corruption exemp@@ li@@ fied Director after release of custody again on previous post
Moz@@ ambi@@ ans reacted with wrath on a corruption case in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence on which the corruption was committed .
&quot; the Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , which was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 along with four other def@@ endants ( about 800 000 Euros ) . &quot;
&quot; the money was from public funds from Moz@@ ambi@@ que , the Council of Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called his re @-@ setting into the company , which happened on 19 April then . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the general state @-@ state Office of the Republic , which exp@@ ires the request , there would be no obstacles to Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to its old post , as the company did not complete a discipl@@ in@@ arity after his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not say good . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Inte@@ gri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ blica , shortly C@@ IP ) , a local institution , committed to public transparency , condemned in an interview with the Deutsche Welle the decision of the company , the director again : &quot;
&quot; establishes a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step forward with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we take note is that even the company should have been guided by a discipline against the conflic@@ ting .
&quot; however , the firm apparently appears and prompted no adequate legal steps to use the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mos@@ ambi@@ an social media , re@@ jects this behavior as well and considers the case as &quot; conflic@@ ting . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to prison sentence and half of them were picked up . &quot;
&quot; he could hold lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he might advise and his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be integrated into the company that he helped to cause damage . &quot;
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
contradic@@ tory !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ ans and student of political sciences in Brazil says , the director had no morality . &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he in@@ quired him I cannot believe someone in such a way that the state has already been so massive .
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead it only served itself by the state itself . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as handmade , it &apos;s an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money source and the state itself has become tired of this man who has been charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I do not know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind you that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ iev@@ es belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el &apos;s prison will not only be remembered as the first independent president but also as a sharp , das@@ hing and - next door - prophe@@ tic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was , when he affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , also the father@@ land for his ambitions , his own individual interest to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ah said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tactic , but he does not turn away from his ambitions . &quot;
a ambitious man is simultaneously criminal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also refused :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he sat down 10 years and came free .
&quot; and today , the company , with which he denied funds again , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Even α@@ ein@@ gs . ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017 &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; means Ki@@ cher@@ erb@@ se or Sp@@ age .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
according to information from Facebook users in Myanmar the well @-@ known Social Network took their Po@@ sts out of the net because they had the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
&quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people ost@@ indi@@ an origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; , &quot; or the &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ical script ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
in recent years the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements gave the word an extremely down@@ cast con@@ notation .
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;s may usually be associated with racism , but the word itself is not automatically called hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also Po@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed for its use . &quot;
&quot; moreover , there are several bur@@ mes@@ ous words with all the different meanings , which have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written in Bur@@ m@@ isch also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; cal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various meanings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends has been deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in a spiritual way whether she knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by doing a word game . &quot;
&quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the fra@@ word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that it will dimin@@ ish hate speech radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook should be analy@@ tic before it all po@@ sts to spread racism that are suspi@@ cion of racism . &quot;
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
the automation is not understood what you write to fac@@ t@@ ook .
&quot; what it should do instead , is the post to carefully analyze and control him by checking the words right next . &quot;
&quot; for example &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the good is that these dirty nation@@ alists are spread , the hate speech , a pretty good lesson . &quot;
&quot; now , it is time to circumc@@ ised its nationalism . &quot;
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to everyone , dissemin@@ ating the hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of perc@@ ei@@ vers is often a t@@ atz@@ - and mouse game , whereby users use social networks to simply use a new word or alternative spelling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author of A@@ ung &apos;s Ka@@ ath described how Facebook began to delete his po@@ sts , when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was attentive to this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and I banned the Li@@ ken , post and sharing of content for 24 hours because of the post &quot; &quot; Facebook community standards &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Facebook has a variety of po@@ sts of people that have no negative intentions or which simply try to show off their opinions against hate speech radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that nothing to do with hate speech :
post office without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author shared his mind about why extreme nationalism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more than the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask for advice : &quot;
Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to decrease racism in Burma through their platform but so it does not work .
to cens@@ oring such words just more hate within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and so words as &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; inheritance curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found that they made mistakes , they didn &apos;t try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied Po@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; if they would only have a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would give them a great turnover , it would be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ orship has provided a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are now taking over Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their Po@@ sts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots from Facebook &apos;s posts , which had no hate speech , but still removed : &quot;

the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch her@@ edi@@ curr@@ y and watch an Indian movie .

&quot; said the post &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot;
scre@@ enshot with permission .
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nationalist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists , who have used social networks to enhance their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks is to attack the violence in Burma in addition to heat , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Buddh@@ ists have forced thousands to escape . &quot;
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to bring the expres@@ siveness of hate on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sides under control .
&quot; but instead of simply thinking the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better running in context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end with the child @-@ toe
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the marriage is in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now illegal .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament has unanimously resolved a law which is to for@@ bid this practice , so that hei@@ ghtened age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; prior to this change of the marriage , some members of Hin@@ ts and Muslim religious communities were held in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ ad Mahar@@ aj came together to a group , representatives of the various religious groups of the country , that the state did not interfere with , since that , age is not the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened irrespective of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was a contractual partner for the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors in the age of 18 years . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married with 15 were already married , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , 2.8 percent was , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Chancell@@ ery of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 were married . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements that tried to escape laws for children before , followed at the bottom and pleasing in great support . undoubtedly helped them to bring this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Hin@@ du guide , for example had no concerns , the critics of the children before saying , they shouldn &apos;t worry about their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition did not care of tension in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and at some point there was doubts about whether the opposition would not agree to the law . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the law was decided against child marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , who enth@@ used himself in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him to the law . &quot;
now only the President of the country has to approve and announce the law .
&quot; one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave on Facebook a status update , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram has once again posted : &quot;
&quot; Mr Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill &apos;s accus@@ ation against the children &apos;s toe was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 voices on this , and no one on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; having decided earlier in the Senate , the draft may now become a law . &quot;
the majority of the social media users were enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws on the nursery had finally been changed .
&quot; Facebook @-@ member Lo@@ vell Francis , who held a ministry in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has too much time and unnecessary talk , that has gr@@ asp@@ ed the core of the thing , but do you know what ? it &apos;s been illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is almost every price . &quot;
&quot; during A@@ bel Jackson of the opinion , it was definitely long enough to save the practice was Lara Qu@@ entr@@ e @-@ Thomas over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Excellent news ! &quot;
the marriage law has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 for that - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ lowing Mut@@ ota that belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civili@@ zed social group that was quite openly discussed about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the delicate age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious bodies 18 years .
&quot; the draft for the amendment of the marriage was reached today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 Euro MPs and 35 were present at the vote . &quot;
&quot; all members of MEPs who have been against , have voted for the law . &quot;
the nursery at Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is no longer permitted by law .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # Car@@ rot @-@ Car@@ rot .
many thanks to all activists who have cast him out .
congratulations .
a thanks to our MEPs .
&quot; but a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dharma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du @-@ Organisation of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj has proclaimed his intention to undertake judicial steps , the law should be passed and he seems to em@@ ulate his promise . &quot;
&quot; during the general pro@@ secutor of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said , unless Mahar@@ ay wants to go against the law , most social media users wish to address the debate differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion in general , in a way that only panic and uncertainty , if we , instead of talking about the problem , that we may need to ab@@ used the state in our bedroom , that they may be of great , hard @-@ minded men who are opposed to them , would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to a judicial approach against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places around the world where children are legal or still the norm is , although there are laws that they say . &quot;

on Sunday the office of the Pro@@ secutor of the local news service Yar@@ News shared that they were h@@ acked .
&quot; by mir@@ rors of web pages , Turkish users can view from Wikipedia content . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contradic@@ tory to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright laws in the US , internationally bl@@ acked . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for over a month , Turkey is now facing the popular and the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia . &quot;
&quot; day after day becomes more evident , how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information . &quot;
both students and journalists and fans of TV @-@ series are fighting against the block .
&quot; although many techniques imposed Internet users are used to use switching tools for block websites ( a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey did not fall into this category the third largest VPN @-@ prevalence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been present from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet has been adopted since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 5@@ 6@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the two @-@ known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to be locked , several Mir@@ r@@ or@@ pages ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia are often updated and often updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform dra@@ fted all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centr@@ alised Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer @-@ network ( i.e. computer @-@ machine connections ) , which does not work on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
the content is available in spite of legal prohibition .
in a blo@@ g@@ post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the news ( via the block of Wikipedia ) , we put everything from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , there is the possibility to read the content on de@@ centralized and distributed . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content , even if you cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedia a.@@ org itself . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS was also assumed that this step was conducted irrespective of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , an open source project that everyone can use to ho@@ ven similar mir@@ r@@ or@@ pages when in the respective country in Wikipedia . &quot;

&quot; it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mir@@ rors . &quot;
one attacks on another URL that is not the original . that which one sees then is from Wikipedia .
&quot; essentially , the server guides the request to correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself when they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar strives to bring herself to the international stage in Nepal . &quot;
&quot; and his homeland is right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that attract the attention of Nep@@ as wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation in his work helps :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate game photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested from home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called . he had received a call from my father that on the shore of Rap@@ ti river would be a leop@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was in a few minutes there .
&quot; my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side , where the leop@@ ard was found and I immediately began to kne@@ el pictures ! ! &quot;
&quot; Sag@@ ar strives for co @-@ operation with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nep@@ as nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so scary , as they look . &quot;
&quot; and he should know , for he was already face to face from face to face : &quot;
a tiger can &apos;t be bothered by the opinion of the sheep not at bed@@ time ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ wei@@ rd appeared . he immediately sat down , seeing us and he star@@ es me through the sc@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
but his passion for the encouragement of Nep@@ as nature and wildlife is not always easy .
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent in order to make pictures of Ot@@ tern at the Bar@@ dia National Park recording . up to 12 days it took to take pictures and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which live near the tourist arrivals . &quot;
take a look at the bottom of some of these photos .

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az Kol@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally published on video Volun@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing convention .
in many parts of India there are women with greatest care to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect the husband because of the social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should abuse the norm in order to keep this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian State O@@ dish@@ a by a sitting , and rejected by her family and the village community after calling for an attached relatives with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives are also not known in the name of men , but is also common among men . however , they have far less right to fear , if at all , if at all , they should not return to this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village Wal@@ he in the district P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health professionals , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club , and were therefore quickly became the main table of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Volun@@ te@@ ers and is committed to the exploitation of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the un@@ covering of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage up to the exile of H@@ IV@@ ING and AIDS infected , and manages this cl@@ ubs . &quot;
they reported how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini was shown in its discussion , was of women who do not name their hus@@ bands . &quot;
she decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem that women can easily identify .
&quot; speaking the name of her hus@@ bands is not to be utter@@ ance , it is a bread , which they kept all guilty and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition testi@@ fied that a woman respects her husband and wish him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not hold this , is considered a h@@ isti@@ g , as a woman without morality . &quot;
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought so far to this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning of Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband before name , trying at home as it works . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband sm@@ iled for a long time after the video was finished .
&quot; intern@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him on his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini launched its first discussion . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women would be protected . &quot;
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to put the discussion with an exercise in motion . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini bat each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can name us how they want , meaning that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her hus@@ bands via the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the breaks of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in the married women could never pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that she ki@@ cked her during the whole exercise only before himself ; another decided to let the whole bla@@ zing frustration against him and his family by removing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; in the adren@@ alin rush about it , having broken with an ancient bread , the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their hus@@ bands at home . &quot;
and they counted their word .
in the next days Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports .
the husband called a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women in his head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she was stub@@ born , she got afraid and told that there was an error . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband a participant in was less understanding and the situation ar@@ ted into violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reported how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red spot on the forehead , which indicates the spouses : &quot;
why do women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would carry the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot when he was doing it too . &quot;
he laughs and I listened to him to carry him .
&quot; the other women have not completely ceased , but they think they are now in a better position , even to choose him not to carry it in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the debate is a safe place where they can replace their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we do a trip on each panel . &quot;
usually we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who could hear what could hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
during the last months she celebrated her own birth@@ days with cakes ; she danced and sang about things that they had never had thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have spoken about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our spouses , never as honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things loud , no matter how small they do . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing . &quot;
some women in the group have taken only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most is the okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ine spa , a vast shirt over a pants , they did not dare . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of arguments and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes of clothes , morality linked to the Sar@@ is and much more , ornam@@ ent Roh@@ ini her own couple of Cur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion , so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they have now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can carry je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is certain that they will be able to create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether in the five months since her first discussion , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things slowly get into rolls : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then listened to the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do it yet , but only if they are alone and have no other family members . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women bear now at any time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead .
&quot; the women in the debate should know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gle for more freedom of movement or their own clothes , at the end of a difficult to navig@@ ating river . &quot;
&quot; giving each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives each one of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when each woman goes home and told other people what we are talking about and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

&quot; for just about five days , the Beatles was in the country , but this has been enough to rot@@ ate the Japanese . &quot;
&quot; it has become clear to the people here , that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms . &quot;
many well known Japanese sizes have reached their zen@@ ith than the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .

another group that is the purpose of creators for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
&quot; this led to a mission to investigate the UN in Southern African country , in order to investigate these practitioners . &quot;

&quot; free Bas@@ sel : Ne@@ ton Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) new reactions of the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and Dis@@ si@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia that was probably made recently .
this story was originally released on 8 July 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of de@@ tained Chinese dissi@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention to the international community after his lawyer in late June had announced that he has been delivered to hospital because of liver cancer . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was condemned to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion , &quot; after completing the draft of the Charter 08 , a Mani@@ fes@@ to , which had demanded democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has reported Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal matter &quot; and a spokes@@ person , he said it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; still China will continue to call up calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , release or allow him treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely exposed to the subject . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese official to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressures in order to enable li@@ u abroad . &quot;
Norway
&quot; Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg , and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ end have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release . &quot;
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway was slow , after the Nobel Prize was awarded to Li@@ u after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 , although the Norwegian Government ins@@ isted that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed in December last year . in June Norway was signed an agreement to resume the salmon @-@ resistant to China since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
&quot; once the message had spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought its hope for a unconditional release to express and lu@@ de Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was not able to counter its price . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a vote where China was asked to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , China also called for the release of Li@@ us on how to take it in a statement on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we are expecting all constraints of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members . &quot;
they are to meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
&quot; us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared the fact that the Americans are &quot; &quot; wishing him &quot; &quot; that he has the opportunity for the treatment abroad , in this respect he may help him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person in the US Embassy in China , Mary and Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27th , that the message was possible to release Chinese authorities , not only Li@@ u but also free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the invitation of the U.S. message attracted an angry response from China to itself , with the utter@@ ance of the foreign Ministry that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and un@@ answered comments about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple following :
&quot; protection and freedom , e.g. free movement and access to the medical care of his choice , to which it is entitled to a Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz , also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to insist that Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally release . &quot;
I call on China to un@@ condition@@ ally release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he could go into a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steff@@ en Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; all the medical support he needed &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Re@@ uters , that China had great concerns , whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could be over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada
on 28 June the Canadian Ambassador John McC@@ all@@ um said to provide adequate medical attention to China and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
&quot; Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ u Woman , Li@@ u X@@ ia that could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak with someone outside , including his lawyers to speak and contact . &quot;
McC@@ all@@ um continues :
&quot; Canada is calling for China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including free speech , to maintain , and for the exercise of these rights un@@ locked . &quot;
France
France &apos;s foreign minister called for China in a statement on 29 June to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o will receive all treatments which he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family can have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news station France Info has already reported that the French government of Li@@ u were welcomed into the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was announced that there will be no further information if France will eventually absorb it . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; the Council of Fest@@ land in Taiwan called on 27 June to release the Li@@ u on 27 June , and to demonstrate a greater tolerance to those who are campa@@ igning for peaceful reforms and democratic development . &quot;
the Ta@@ i@@ wan@@ ese legis@@ lators Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Liber@@ al Party also called for China to allow the sick intellectual li@@ u to treat themselves in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very concerned in a statement on 28 June by Li@@ u , and gave that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my faith that the initiatives he took and for whom he was severely punished , to a harmon@@ ise , stable and aff@@ lu@@ ent China could have contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I personally felt very moved and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state .
&quot; however , according to the Minister of Justice K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am should be considered Singapore as a city . &quot;
this remark also triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of international branches of the law firm of the Association of New York , the Minister reiter@@ ated that many people critici@@ zed the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they are compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he support Singapore as a city should be considered .
nobody questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; rot@@ ate logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , according to all our efforts and inv@@ itations to create this valuable land , we hear that we are ultimately no country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the impression of an escape from the responsibilities , a mandatory breach . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , the country is it ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons mentioned by Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very pos@@ h : he defended one idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries , given the fact he appeared in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore is to be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core point of the issue , the good old gul@@ f emerges from the author@@ itarian rulers , who pre@@ clu@@ es Democrats , leave the tw@@ isted logic , since they fit better into their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end of the last week of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am were given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our ju@@ dict@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ replies . &quot;
corresponding questions tar@@ ed with non @-@ Ans@@ wer kind .
Rachel Z@@ eng demands Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am to clear his opinion since they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; Singapore is not a country , but a city is , therefore , to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our dear K Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take the trouble to clear that point unless it was paid high , in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; publishing on the blog its comment , he points out the cri@@ tiques to read the whole co @-@ scription of the conference , so that you could understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am better , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the journal .
&quot; when he said Singapore was more a &quot; city &quot; as a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ equally important even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he se@@ per@@ ated Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; as he said , Singapore &quot; was not a land , &quot; he obviously doesn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who makes a leader of a growing generation , such a polem@@ ical statement . &quot;
&quot; I am talking about what is said to be the Minister of Justice of Singapore , ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that is another matter . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure whether he really believes it is correctly associated and aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review presents the weaknesses of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
has Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; well@@ believer an error &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speakers ?
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only viewed as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , what land go back to the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city . &quot;
&quot; as he plays an important role within the government , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am are of grave importance . &quot;
&quot; why do they afford their military service , defend it only their city but not their country ? &quot;
who has to pay back to our prime minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink staff ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ y@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city : &quot;
I have not told what I said ...
this set seems to have anno@@ yed many of the soul ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a town .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; the defense of the country above all &quot; &quot; etc . , but that is not quite true . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Kan@@ adi@@ ers &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Fl@@ anders .
scre@@ enshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices wondered at short his editors : what is the most mis@@ used aspect of your hometown or home country ?
&quot; their answers are published here as part of a continued series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world , and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question that is asked for me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; &quot; I am coming from Canada . &quot; &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered polite to show interest in their inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ or by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; on my clar@@ inet there is usually the default answer : &quot; Oh , rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans may also cook as in@@ wardly in mind , if they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t bother . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distinguishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans give a Canadian flag well visible to their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was , when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans always have little m@@ ap@@ le blades at their luggage to differentiate themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
with us there is no weapons !
gender @-@ like marriages in Canada have been legal since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; excuse . &quot;
Canada is said to be regarded as the tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , which I highly admired . &quot;
there would be nothing if you would like to switch me from Dallas from Dallas to me .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first , being said to be &quot; nice , &quot; in essence , to be id@@ le - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but tragic un@@ important figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ son &quot; ( who has a own Canadian double @-@ go@@ er ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing that you can encounter . &quot;
to be harmless is in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and no attention to earn .
&quot; this can be a good thing , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go far as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , a leading role of Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders as &apos; nice &apos; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Can@@ adi@@ ans are not often talking about the fence .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I have now connected with my American friends . &quot;
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then J@@ ustin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada quite sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ ves Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop band has released a music video which took the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and restore the civilian government , despite its failure to restore the civilian government , the country continues . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ sted Girl ) , the band Tattoo Col@@ our describes a young man who tells of what rules him his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; although not expressly politically , the music video refers to the continuing military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video about the song was great success .
&quot; within the first three days , this was divided on Facebook up@@ loaded video 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; Der Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists requested the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , special to how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
take a look at these recordings of the video that relate to some of the political issues that have pers@@ ist@@ ently per@@ secuted in the past three years .
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the wire Section 44 of the provisional constitution , which makes the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision making of important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the &quot; &quot; changing program &quot; &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are considered by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the implementation of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities in order to susp@@ end activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose a new unit was established in the army , the online content is monitored and individuals who are accused , the monarchy will sl@@ ander@@ ed , pro@@ secuted . &quot;
Thailand poses a strict law against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Maj@@ ority ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war was established in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a put@@ sch of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to continue to buy expensive U boats , although security expert they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video there is even shown how people are thrown into a black shipping car , before taking them into an interfer@@ ing camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are sitting in prison , because they have supposedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened long distances , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; this showed the te@@ aser of the song members of the band members , who im@@ it@@ ated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; who was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost cities in Eastern Asia .

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war company recovered very slowly in East @-@ Asia @-@ Asia , particularly in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it has now been over 20 years since the Georgian war was officially ended , but its scars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal @-@ basin of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , amor@@ zers , Geor@@ gi@@ ers and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , for the largest part of Russians and tri@@ bun@@ ni@@ es live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost@@ al cities .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10.000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people living in these gh@@ ost cities . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 the total population of the district 16@@ ,000 people had barely risen over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the empty fif@@ ties of the Soviet Union of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ g@@ kov@@ kas , are symbolic of the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are falling and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he begins a conversation and it turns him hard to end this .
&quot; it is all a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is unique . &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were municipal centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , which served all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splendor @-@ buildings .
&quot; the people , who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have left the district . &quot;
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live approximately fifty inhabitants .
&quot; approximately 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ ow@@ kas , which are still one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they go back immediately . &quot;
&quot; our mother forbidden us to photograph us , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it simply has forbidden it to us , that is all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pering her girlfriend something and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining enterprise called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ s@@ istence ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own needs ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable @-@ cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to come about the rounds .
the District management provides for free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ alya as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to D@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not abandoned in front of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia to live with her . &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia , &quot; she tells her . &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to accept financial support from her daughter and ins@@ ists that she supports her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas Mon@@ ty R@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot;

&quot; a 90 @-@ year old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; if holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
but we cannot constantly do this - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls aun@@ t G@@ alya her to . &quot; they said , we could build Zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will be zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as conversation Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and five common children in their house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remember the thor@@ n before war .
&quot; despite the relatives , who live in central Russian , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ ch@@ ord broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has rather something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was little work and all lived as it was right .
every day I remember how the city and the war was once .
as our conversation the end tends to be a little boy over us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy hun@@ ts him back .
he plays with the ball that goes down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
&quot; while walking , some of them throw stones on the exp@@ ir@@ ated buildings . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are a part of their childhood , who care for uncertainty in their lives . &quot;
they do not know it differently .

in Mexico hosts &quot; Mama Africa &quot; migrants on their long journey
&quot; Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez manages a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

&quot; this article by Amy Br@@ ack was published on 19 April 2017 , on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and will appear here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; across the way of migrants , across Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located on the border with Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is headed by a 5@@ 9@@ - year @-@ old Mex@@ i@@ kan@@ erin with a small woman with a coral @-@ pink bri@@ ch and gol@@ d@@ colored ear@@ rings in t@@ ed@@ dy bears .
&quot; she is called Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez , and grew up in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa . &quot;
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ ti@@ ans who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2.@@ 50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with st@@ ole , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the room there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - but there are hundreds of African and ha@@ i@@ ti@@ cian migrants here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people are coming to full buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on cart@@ ons . &quot;
it does not want anyone to decline .
&quot; she also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medications that they can &apos;t pay , they mas@@ hed them with a bal@@ sam the exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived in a short time . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a sta@@ che beard ) , with Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ ack .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
&quot; you have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make use of normal a first stop in South America and then go north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other gu@@ ardi@@ ans from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a famous name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
&quot; he tells that the Hai@@ ti@@ ans and the Afri@@ cans are often travelling together , and that Afri@@ cans speak already at W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; like many of his companion , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil in advance and worked as building workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Football Championship . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his trip to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ tian .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we never leave them again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that their guests are often sending messages messages when they have continued to gr@@ ate her or to report her about the course of their journey .
she explained that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her to cook the chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez may be very well known , but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants travelling through Tap@@ es@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city there is a dead end to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter was added to Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family in their small house .
he is a poli@@ cem@@ an and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are too expensive too expensive .
&quot; he started to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar per night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ ti@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blankets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
&quot; Valen@@ zu@@ ela , that he knows what the guests are doing . &quot;
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; says he . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border to the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived three years , he was transferred to the United States after a raid on his work place . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to squee@@ ze money from him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and a unknown , an all@@ ot@@ ted , has offered him its roof . &quot;
&quot; some months later , the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests .
in the courses the travellers consult quiet their phones .
&quot; a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that their house is full , but it is also nostal@@ gically , because of those who have gone away . &quot;
like a proud grandmother de@@ mar@@ es her in her album with many photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair stain@@ ed , who made her a Kund@@ alini , some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more , boy and old . &quot;
they laugh so she told me briefly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repeated every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ Point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users ?
&quot; the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on 10 July , the mobile user in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell notification in which it points the District government to install a surveillance app named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the communication , it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;
but k@@ ò@@ ries the authorities use the app for more than fighting terrorism .
&quot; according to an exclusive report on Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested by Kaz@@ ak@@ h in the autonomous pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app , exchanged messages with a private We@@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police state that the app would determine the sources and distribution paths of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block@@ age of por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , Tro@@ jan@@ ers and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and to control their own home network . &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many different ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; remote &quot; &quot; state actors or even h@@ ackers could be able to manipulate the home network of a person or ste@@ al it . &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures to take control of digital activities in this region .
&quot; while the messages about digital cens@@ orship in China tend to focus on the experience of users in major cities in the east and south , reality is very often dark for those who live in distant , ethnic ethnic minorities such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit distur@@ ban@@ ces and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme C@@ ens@@ ored and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ous Internet de@@ preci@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the media @-@ based media out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( Op@@ tic converter ) , published news from a Check@@ point , presented photos from a check@@ point , at the police officers t@@ apping the people in@@ discrimin@@ ate if they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be de@@ tained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; they have forced people to use tools , which are intended for older people . &quot;
this is a form of captivity by the rest of the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( Op@@ ini@@ zed column ) , also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang @-@ product description , from which the software can up@@ lift the password requirement of a Windows operating system and therefore get full access to the computer &apos;s hard disk . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computer and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic handles . &quot;
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are possibly a response to the instructions of the City of Party Council to minimize the distribution of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and institutions related institutions including universities and research institutions are obligated to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office on the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current report from Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned this new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , a regulation to all the residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media cards . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to identify and destroy . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole number of other possible abuse , including those that relate to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : all cry after death &quot;

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane had his experience in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at and realize that you are alone in a place where everything is gone . &quot;
&quot; everything has been dissolved , and a truth reveals that is clearly visible both inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes their name all glory .
one who has cast down into a list of feelings and expressions that no metaph@@ ors allow .
&quot; but when you get back the reality and you are behind the scenes - beyond the scenes , the beautiful scenes and performers - turn the characters into beings of flesh and blood , and all shou@@ ting to death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts solve themselves in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even if the Earth is caught up on the axis of the evil . you realize that you &apos;re caught here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grandparents , stone built around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have been arrested me and my father three times , but that was not yet enough for me to be &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the boss of the intelligence service was formulated - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he set his power over us under evidence by even destroyed the simplest concepts we had .
five teenagers were destroyed during a peaceful protests like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; it was enough , so that the city sh@@ attered the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; All @-@ ahu &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; all neighbour@@ hoods sought after , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , rainy , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that is cro@@ oked up to the arteries with government safety organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had cal@@ med down somewhat , after the power supply in the district came to work . &quot;
&quot; I searched out the silence , by crying several times &quot; &quot; All @-@ ahu &quot; &quot; of my house @-@ roof . &quot;
I heard my voice in the silence of the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to gather together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we ended up to a glorious picture , filled with my expectations and fully filled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you realize that you are liber@@ ated the spirit from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the bar@@ ing@@ est . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet us at the military safety building . &quot;
he placed him .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low down - nothing can give you your voice back , after you put it all the way up to the office of the safety service from the body . &quot;
I came there .
the Upper Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I am now .
&quot; the Upper Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; let also hear me , how you cry &apos; All @-@ ahu &apos; , or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not near . &quot;
his h@@ water @-@ filled eyes turned on me .
&quot; and you really love what to look into the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I then did has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was on my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity , perhaps at the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure to me , when I answered , &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I have never ceased to look at your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in sol@@ itary , and his father straight with it . &quot;
&quot; his father right with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the st@@ ank of this distorted sentence lies me up to now in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a psych@@ ic torture , which I was exposed for months . &quot;
I per@@ v@@ eth the court .
in the first office I leave everything I am carrying .
&quot; then back through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a walk to the single cells . &quot;
I give me all the details exactly before I shared the room .
unlike otherwise they have probably shared a larger cell in this time .
&quot; I have to share it with only one other prisoner , and should put me immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I grab@@ bed a well @-@ proven communication method : to strike the wall against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my Z@@ ellen@@ gen@@ osse was a &quot; &quot; first &quot; &quot; mate . &quot;
after a long hesitation he finally rep@@ lied to me .
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells , there was a respected man middle age that looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness can be seen in me no distinctive facial excerpts , and doctors are not available here ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice is similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all the answers are their existence .
perhaps he was moved into one of the big cells .
maybe he will immediately stop .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had insured me , they would not hate him when I stay . &quot;
li@@ ars .
&quot; I would like to have had a scar@@ ring to exp@@ el all these cro@@ wing , which are lab@@ eled by the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance I still hear them &quot; &quot; All @-@ ahu &quot; &quot; scre@@ am . &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 am in the evening ; always at this time , the cry , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of destruction , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; &quot; th@@ unders &quot; , &quot; play on 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to hear .
&quot; in order to protect and prevent the secret : to protect the state security from us , and to prevent the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their con@@ fes@@ sions from their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house that is here no land ; it is a curse , which they call co @-@ existence to transform the criminals of their sound into a mighty men . &quot;
&quot; I watch the audi@@ t@@ orium and tre@@ ffe on Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me . &quot;
&quot; he cap@@ tures a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the face @-@ express that he ent@@ ailed him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can close as much more important to your life than to protest that day@@ light and protest on demonstrations that will soon be an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I used to contact me not to answer .
I can really no longer say when insul@@ ts and stro@@ kes have become a friendly talk for me to become an ordinary communication technology .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to get used to it , punished me although I had done nothing to earn that punishment . &quot;
in punishment in all their variety .
its command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
&quot; he calls the loving &quot; &quot; con@@ fession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er shi@@ ver to your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot hold your cry out . &quot;
&quot; my cry did not fell enough , why she re@@ comp@@ acted the pipe through a cable . &quot;
&quot; at my first time I asked myself whether the investig@@ ators had worked as a trash collection , or if it belonged to normal work equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cable inter@@ tw@@ ined to present us the , from their point of view , great invention of an enormous cable . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour , three of them are changing , while I was still on the line . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which I heard . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noted the cooling , and found no favour at all , which is why he attacked an electric up@@ stream . &quot;
flow through my whole body enough to store my entire neighborhood .
&quot; my semi @-@ nude body , which was spread on the ground , was the perfect electric ladder . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must have been so around midnight .
&quot; I decided to sleep again , saying , let &apos;s say that was my only option . &quot;
some hours left that came to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the dawn fills the room &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answered with the voice of a exhausted young people : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father needs to be fear@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and be@@ weg you , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Russian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b spends most of his time in the inside ; sometimes he mu@@ til@@ ted to his canvas , to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine inhal@@ ed lips .
&quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house , which had been part of them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel had fulfilled his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family had to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as rocky ( e.g. : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been an im@@ passion@@ ed activ@@ ist who represents the conservative majority and questioned their alt@@ proven opinions about gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression by art and rap@@ music . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , but he also calls for the core of the whole Arab world . all these issues are not only rich in its hometown Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ anz , but also in cities that reach Damascus to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted to his mind , and he can feel loud with people who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not openly give it openly , he triumph@@ s against US American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b regards his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war @-@ areas , to do something with his identity as &quot; Palestinian people &quot; to do so , even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I am not thinking about my own life circumstances , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he sha@@ king a café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ramad@@ an ; at this time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the law of law also states that public consumption is illegal during Ramad@@ an .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ sing hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
basically the sm@@ s warm coffee and the Sch@@ wa@@ ders of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom .
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when one casts a look into the neighboring countries . &quot;
therefore it &apos;s easy to do basic things - as to drink in the public during Ramad@@ an Water - in order not to land in prison .
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled an appearance of the band Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some of the parliament@@ arians who support the Islamic Action Plan - argued that the sexual orientation of the homo@@ sexu@@ als of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homo@@ sexual fron@@ ts@@ pe@@ ers Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional norms of the country contradic@@ ts and the main reason for the concert . &quot;
the MP and former press conference in the Islamic coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was &quot; straight &quot; due to the sexual orientation of the singer .
&quot; many also affir@@ ms that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is to be more dangerous activ@@ ism that questioned the proven legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la the people of human rights as a &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights &quot; committed themselves to an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement may not be simply not easy to reach rhet@@ oric , but in fact reflect a clear cryst@@ all@@ ine reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs work . &quot;
in 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b traditional gender standards to be Lei@@ be by having made his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a clearly low @-@ known woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust . &quot;
in Jordan the number of &apos; Hon@@ mor@@ tar &apos; has increased in Jordan - the in@@ official outside .
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of Hon@@ mor@@ ants reached its peak in 2016 ; however , the institutional infrastructure is still lacking in order to aid the women who tried victims of domestic or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the threat of domestic violence , &quot; and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort , as well as the guarantee by the family that the woman has nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ bs Music enjoys great popularity and is known for it , even though not to shy back on topics , in his country long as tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b will dispute that his work is politically , however , however , that he is his music , the full explicit attack on sexuality , freedom and expression is not from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; for me was a question of politics , &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack .
in &quot; Lav@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated many times :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , on which one can get in his words , &quot; which one wants &quot; - be it faith or failure , hetero@@ gene@@ ity , or homo@@ sexuality . &quot;
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on the equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ individuals were highly cens@@ ored until 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b introduced an interview for the popular part of the popular program Ro@@ ya to realize that his comments were torn down from the context and had been cens@@ ored by his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but was only a revised version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b buys the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homo@@ sexu@@ als do not speak to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he mentions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , which has remained in memory today thanks to its homo@@ erotic poetry . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks for himself : if Abu Nu@@ what , who was later to work on behalf of the potassium , could be open in the eighth century openly about homo@@ sexuality , why can Jord@@ an@@ ier this not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the Has@@ hem@@ ite Kingdom , there is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ anic news service took several former members of government members and members of the teacher , with the reason they had expressed opposition to the problems that deeply rooted in the country deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the concert H@@ da@@ i@@ bs believes that only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ier . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is a constant Gi@@ ve and Take . Jordan , Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la now has a show for the second time , but the way of progress - it is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , printed and internal changes . it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ anic society . &quot;
&quot; finally , dre@@ aming H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , also , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dreams not only dreams of bringing his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience them . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is going through music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not through bombs , Stre@@ et@@ uni@@ tions and on artificial way of guided democracies . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until that time , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue and therefore can afford resistance . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these great , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories about the origin of Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; it is thought that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival that is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory means that the strongh@@ olds , the drum and dancing over more than one thousand years were handed down to the Nor@@ theast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to the knees . &quot;
we are at Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to pick up some great seats , that &apos;s why we have a great view . &quot;
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( verb@@ t@@ l ) . &quot;
I looked at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two flo@@ cks are straight to see .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival uses the only True - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high land@@ car was amazing .

&quot; rarely , external appearance and body care were so important as in this history , as they help to hold the Peruvian youth from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ style . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where road consuming and illegal drug stores are daily . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has led to getting more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers you can form these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the most extreme limits of imagination and creativity , even has inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers your &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there are experts in each other , to show who can create the most exact L@@ ooks , as one can see in the following video ( more videos about current competitions there are on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school of August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who found himself in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to engage young people to get their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools , and instead of bad advice for training in hair@@ style , which allows them to find jobs . &quot;
motivated by this activity and the best opportunities have dozens of young people seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the beginning of March and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud of because of love for the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love @-@ letters on guer@@ rilla fighters
photo : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
usage with friendly permission .
&quot; the following article is the revised version of the contribution &quot; &quot; love message on guer@@ rilla fighters &quot; &quot; which has released the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the article will be published here in the framework of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people that we know ?
&quot; is it not much more important , people who feel alien@@ ated , affection ? &quot;
this question was precisely the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga by the Foundation Bogot@@ a and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os of the Young @-@ Youth Foundation not more out of the head and inspired her to the campaign C@@ art@@ as p@@ or la Re@@ public@@ li@@ ación ( letters for Re@@ conci@@ liation ) which would encourage young people to write guer@@ rilla letters .
&quot; recently , her country was at the heart of a historic event , and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiation , the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace treaty with the guer@@ rilla war F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces colum@@ bi@@ ens ) , which forms the Schl@@ us@@ point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; international was the sig@@ nat@@ ing of the peace treaty , as significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos for his merits for the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded . &quot;
&quot; however , in front of the Colom@@ bian , there is still a long way to get to speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ ri@@ cal fighters who have lived for many years in illegal bearings , have been exposed to a war rhet@@ oric and carried out their arms around the clock , now have to integrate themselves into the living as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society again , who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases profound hatred against guer@@ rilla fighters , must record them into their ranks and support them in setting up a new life . &quot;
&quot; Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young colum@@ bi@@ ans have to join together , and to help the integration process . &quot;
&quot; and that is exactly what they did , until now , thousands of young people wrote letters - love message on former guer@@ rilla fighters to welcome them back in society . &quot;
the target of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ rilla warfare that can then be handed over to personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters to reconciliation was created at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize winner who took place in Bogot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to speak shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; that explained that we love the people we love to write on Valentine &apos;s Day thousands of love letters , but those forgot that they need much more necessary . &quot;
&quot; he plane , he told , he continued to share his love with people this year that were most urgent . &quot;
&quot; so the plan came to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of F@@ ARC , who now need to find their place in society and to build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to say discourse from a war history to a common history of peace . &quot;
up to now more than 2000 letters have been collected in the campaign .
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major towns of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ quit@@ illa and Bogot@@ á . &quot;
I have never thought that someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over to the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogot@@ a traveled to the camp to convey the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC presented themselves as they did before to counter the prec@@ ep@@ ts of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no orders , but letters full of shelter from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very mobile moment for all involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between &quot; , &quot; told the policy @-@ student Manuela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra , a representative of the Govern@@ ors of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience so : &quot;
&quot; after we had passed the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of guer@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ book &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ rilla army had seen ) , I saw a guer@@ rilla fighters who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down because alongside him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ e@@ ject , a deadly weapon in the bush . &quot;
&quot; and I said to him nevertheless , &quot; &quot; hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answered a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hope@@ ful letter .
&quot; never in my life has someone written something so nice , so I responded to it . &quot; then suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I embr@@ aced him completely and put me next to the pom@@ e@@ gro@@ wer .
&quot; perhaps he was the war , sorry , all the years of the faithful companion of this fighters were to be , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC , the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I have never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; but now where peace reigns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; to the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already conquered .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC explained the history of the organization , its ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years we have experienced how the social injustice of the state on the whole Colom@@ bian people worked out . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to shaping the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this magnitude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; these people have never been heard and had no right choice , and to realize that people that I often have seen as monsters and even hate , even people with beautiful feelings , who were revers@@ ed by their living circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , does me hurt . &quot;
&quot; but it comfor@@ ted me that all people - even those who have killed and so much damage , we can teach us and give a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the City of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
the colum@@ bi@@ an@@ ists was prophes@@ y that after dis@@ armament peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as it exist inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to rise up to the weapons and to protest for their rights . and that is completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we from F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call upon all defen@@ ders of peace - regardless of which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence , will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homo@@ sexu@@ als and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ ca@@ sian region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
with terror activists have experienced the coverage of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but the threat , which depends like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ y above the dor@@ man@@ t LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not only overnight . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what happens at the moment in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q @-@ legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered international head@@ lines , after reports were published , which were devoted to exhau@@ st , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta , she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , the suspi@@ cious que@@ er men commemor@@ ated and they were in secret prisons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
&quot; when they grow up , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ echn@@ ya had experienced from the sexual tense of their land lady , the hunt was opened at Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; out of fear for her life , she moved the last analysis to the USA . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was working as a volunteer hel@@ pers in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone took my help .
&quot; it was a def@@ endant from D@@ ag@@ est@@ an , a Trans@@ wife who put in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hesitation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone made of whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them anywhere on the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . so , there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the lap by the whole of W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was right here , a couple of shopping cart out of the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a men &apos;s vote : &quot; this is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence but this time on the Che@@ chen : &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you de@@ fle@@ ck ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I know only that it was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and woke up the final analysis in the hospital again .
apparently some women had everything to get in and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two sampling in my right lungs . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : in which hospital wings , you were laid - in the men or women ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , there is still my male name ; but the doctor understood and laid me among the women . &quot;
I am very grateful to him .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a k@@ au@@ kas@@ ic name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he respectful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
in the last February I received threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a nightmare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some remote relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all that was a lie .
&quot; they made absurd demands : some said to me , I had to prove it , I wanted to enter the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was only bad , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have a body size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for them .
some older men spoke even my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world not only your family , but the whole Republic has damaged . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she placed a stri@@ ck around the neck .
luckily the neighbors got and saved them .
&quot; at the time , I had to switch to the apartment several times a day . &quot;
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later was placed under the window a car with bl@@ acked window discs and a numer@@ ical sign with a 95 dr@@ on .
&quot; after the third time had happened , I realized that something was lazy . &quot;
my human @-@ ri@@ ler friends check out the number of people - it turned out that I was per@@ secuted .
OC Media : how are you flying ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons I would not want to award their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help I left the country , but then something terrible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without having to register without having to know , without everything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the trash .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card in my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t think about , you warmer in security , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
&quot; our people know already , in which hotel you st@@ eck@@ el . you even know your room number . &quot;
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still contact your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about the gender equality , which is a table theme . &quot;
some traditional k@@ au@@ tics elements I still wear in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , this psychological barrier can not be overcome . &quot;
&quot; I say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually give me trouble the person who looks out of her past - that is , to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who are dor@@ sal ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I have submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the first time I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked with someone who has sent a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during Ramad@@ an there were no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ramad@@ an could hardly wait , and he closed a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; for this I mean , they probably invite the relatives to take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end ask a proof that the so called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced by blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are also now gay men in these in@@ filtr@@ ations ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says it would not be very many .
&quot; if , then above all those who have no rich relatives or have been dropped by their relatives by Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be held there so that they can present them later than terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; should they be brought in , they will show their bodies on television and claim they would have attacked any village or military base . &quot;
understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply gone , but specifically settled in order to radic@@ alise itself . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : is this now just a mut@@ ation , or do you have a source for this information ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was incar@@ cer@@ ated one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people disappeared in this prison after their beard grew .
there has been nothing new of them since then .
they have just taken them .
&quot; and this so called Lord , that person was with me , when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; so far , however , they were not presented as a ban@@ dits , but there were still no reports before . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why else could it not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know if this per@@ secu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I always played my hair for a long time .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I believe , already before 2003 I was familiar to the whole of Gros@@ ny , when I lived there - and I never had problems . &quot;
in the Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us back to the &quot; &quot; Civil Liber@@ ation &quot; &quot; , but eventually back to the stone @-@ time . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were spot@@ ted ; I had colored eyelashes , bore tube je@@ ans and short t@@ ops . &quot;
the safety Ministry of Sh@@ aria has never even scrat@@ ched me a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew it ; they knew why men , young people there met . &quot;
we have never been offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a phrase : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is said : &quot; Sp@@ otte is not over the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
they often say it to children if they make themselves funny over the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so simply put her eyes closed before you , because they believed you are sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they have never been offen@@ ded , never hun@@ ted and never be@@ aten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace time stopped ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began speaking on television about mor@@ als . &quot;
&quot; he did not speak about us , but above the behavior of women . &quot;
nevertheless - you could feel how people began to change in the city .
&quot; who had sm@@ iled and lau@@ ghed up , saw you at one time with suspi@@ cion . &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic constantly disappeared . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the U.S. are not much .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communic@@ ates with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organise teac@@ up , coexistence , I beg@@ ining it to the hospital and help them get Essen@@ sk@@ ate . &quot;
I have no c@@ ents for it for a long time .
I have discovered these people myself as I dive in refuge .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is Algeri@@ an .
&quot; so is nature , that has nothing to do with religion at all . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to make you prophes@@ y in front of the mouth , that there is no g@@ ays by them . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ ag@@ est@@ ans have what the cab@@ s have , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet there are they - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear . &quot;
so many men come from the Caucasus .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fa@@ sten during Ramad@@ an - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think about transi@@ tions of men that love men , and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a Tru@@ g@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation , to be exact , different life settings . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
don &apos;t know if I have a partner or not .
sorry that I will be so personally here but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am myself .
local groups warn of an increase of self @-@ murder within the impover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty @-@ rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since the last few months there has been a strong increase in self @-@ murder . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August rec@@ alled the du@@ bi@@ ased situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran which is characterised by poverty and unemployment .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Thai in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he ashamed of his own helpl@@ ess@@ ness that can arise for his family , as Ah@@ mad human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; a video shared on YouTube held the moments , after he had dressed himself . &quot;
&quot; some people managed to clear the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the combustion were so strong that doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only su@@ icide that has occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists especially warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : it was all family ef@@ athers who felt like the persecution of the Iranian government , helpl@@ ess and in@@ capable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region where most of the people living in Iran live in the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community has been shaken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it hard to deny the native Arab population to deny their living . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took over power and took great efforts to stop ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest in Iran @-@ coming oil and gas fields as well as some of the most powerful and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the native population is only little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and hard@@ ships . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime has denied systematically jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of roofs , built water from the Arab areas into the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
these dem@@ me have only led to exac@@ erb@@ ate the devast@@ ation in the region and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palms industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi young has now risen to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Direc@@ torate General for Ko@@ operative , Work and Social Wel@@ fare , announces that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who have completed a job , completed 55 % a further school , and 45 % a university degree . &quot;
a systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance ;
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ azi Human Rights activ@@ ist with resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices , that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ murder among young Ah@@ w@@ azi men . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ him@@ i said , &quot; &quot; Do@@ him@@ i said that especially unemployment has become worse . reason for this is a combination of a high number of Ah@@ wa@@ z new to ethnic and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process : &quot;
&quot; as functional and institutions pre@@ fers not to set the Arab force , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi will have access to labour opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs , and force them to earn their living outside of their homeland . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their superi@@ ors and surname to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ azi , and thus to become in@@ toler@@ ated , as even Arabic names in the workplace are not toler@@ ated , ref@@ uses the speaking of the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi need to endure , human rights defen@@ ders open , before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avoidable .

why I do not identify with femin@@ ism but also with inter@@ sec@@ tional struggle
detail of a photo . taken by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons license .
&quot; the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was subject to several discussions , in which many different positions were expressed . &quot;
they can be read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; if I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with frustration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; they even place well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments against me , why I should be femin@@ ist , and why in general , all femin@@ ist * should be inside . &quot;
&quot; for example , that women still earn less money despite the same education than men . &quot;
that women are still under strict observation when it comes about what they should do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later come into a smooth ceiling , and that discrimination based on gender is still through the many different countries and cre@@ ws . &quot;
all of this is aware and well known .
I am convinced of it and I am double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , when I speak on skin colour , on racism , on black CIS women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Diaspora , when I mention how we always have physically , psychological and verbal abuse , both in and outside the feminist movement , decide to mention many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; raise their voices and &quot; &quot; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my Lord &quot; to sing &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about it , that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institu@@ tion@@ alized form of rac@@ ist violence that we have black women exposed to two times . &quot;
&quot; or about that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities , as well as places of origin , make less money than white men and women . &quot;
that black girls and girls are often referred to school more often than white girls because of obvious integration problems .
or that women in black sphere and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership as white women .
&quot; on the one hand I want to have all women , all the men and all the people of any skin color ; on the other hand , I can not join a movement in whose centre the white woman , which refuse to consider in@@ justi@@ ces in their mind that relate to both the gender and the skin colour of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented spheres that always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; dear 1851 in her speech : &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also wei@@ ghed myself to maintain an ideology in which the black woman in a historic sense is a de@@ human@@ ly and margin@@ alised nature . &quot;
&quot; I wei@@ ghed myself to close group@@ ings , which also absor@@ bs our customs and customs to advance their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to draw white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping of skin colour and gender . for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to instruc@@ t them for the better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different home income and to borders themselves from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot;
&quot; I draw it before , release me full of femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which is called stub@@ born for my dark skin and my status as a woman , that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tional is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; it is now more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres , which are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ em , the writer in the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ an@@ ism : rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ismus : as we can defend ourselves ) that we can defend ourselves in this way also , in which they are completely secure and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered that make the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after they read these lines , please ask you to inform themselves about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement of which the black woman is concerned . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can up@@ lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this paradigm I exist . &quot;
I will be recognized as a woman because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman part of this paradigm .
&quot; I , a black woman , can b@@ lossom in an environment where my life is neither over , nor ignored . &quot;
pad@@ del@@ ich against the pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Re@@ ub@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
&quot; repeatedly , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with surf board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Iraqi Kurdistan region . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
in this documentary by EM@@ IL@@ Y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to its community .
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river which we had lost as I was still a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells us . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dust arm@@ rests , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a immediate water crisis in Iraq . &quot;

Paraguay &apos;s women and their difficult fight against violence
a group women represents &quot; The crying women &quot; to express their pain about the women &apos;s murder in the country and in the region and to show their rejection .

&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and processed version of the article &quot; &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; this article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # consecr@@ ate women ) , which reported on violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
most names have been changed to protect the individuals concerned .
&quot; a police comm@@ iss@@ ary said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex@@ partner who had been campa@@ igning to violence against violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship some time had passed and the police said , their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena made because of failure , the acute display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was nothing . &quot;
a few days later the second woman moved their ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women do not even refund at all , they generally receive no support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also dependent on the men who are miserable . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence , in general , in law @-@ law enforcement authorities . &quot;
content 1 beats and Statisti@@ cs 2 Un@@ visible Mis@@ sions and a judicial system that is not sub@@ mer@@ ing 3 of Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , def@@ ective implementation of stro@@ kes and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women really miserable , My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for Gen@@ der@@ ask at Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a soci@@ ological research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various statements and reports , but not even ans@@ at@@ ed the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
the available figures however are alar@@ ming .
&quot; in 2015 , during the District @-@ state Office 9@@ 600 ads went on for domestic violence against domestic violence . at 70 % of this it went to violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the police officers came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace of peace . here , 86 % of the ads came here . &quot;
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women spoke that they were physically mis@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse . &quot;
but these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen women &apos;s Minister of Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; on any woman who re@@ funded in Paraguay for psych@@ ic abuse ad , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; every woman , which is re@@ funded because of physical abuse ad , come two women who do not do this , &quot; stated at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; because women &apos;s su@@ icide in Paraguay is not an own criminal off@@ ence , law enforcement authorities cannot be appropriately documented how many women can be murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; until August 2016 , journalists at least 12 cases of women &apos;s su@@ icide in the country . &quot;
the Co@@ ordinator of Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible Mis@@ sions and a legal system that is not taking anything
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he ins@@ isted that she called him the name of all of her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning it didn &apos;t really want it , but then she said . this should be rep@@ ented for ever . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos . but for two years , they carried the mental force on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious recognizable : &quot;
I had never thought that I would be victims of failure .
&quot; when I read earlier about it , I always thought that the only women would happen to be sub@@ servi@@ ent because they dec@@ eive themselves of violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , they wrote posts on Facebook , in which they described its insul@@ ts and various attacks throughout their two @-@ year relationship and told how he ins@@ ulated them . &quot;
&quot; many people answered their posts , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically , whether he ever raised the hand against them , and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of failure . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had fallen by Carlos so long and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse have at least had a certain complic@@ ity .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , which was not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , in order to prove that her former partner has ming@@ led her . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Network Y@@ o CRE@@ O ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of failure .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic failure .
her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as ads in the authorities remained without a result and also of their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; it introduced a process against its former partners who developed into an un@@ man@@ age@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country , in which it was primarily about money , power and influence of their former partner . &quot;
Paraguay laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws , which are very good but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the ad of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organization for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems when applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was deb@@ ated on 10 August 2016 , which was announced under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # Prin@@ ter ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter being supported by Am@@ nesty International .
&quot; the original design of the law faces , Fem@@ izi@@ d to explain to a stand@@ alone criminal off@@ ences and harder to pun@@ ish as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; in some points , the legislative text was changed in some points so that the MEPs have been p@@ aving the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions that are currently prohibited in Paraguay up to five years . &quot;
&quot; the original bill was envisaged , the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs that have to bear the victims of force at present , if they just want to report and receive a safe accommodation to the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri argued that the law is not effective unless the legisl@@ ator will not provide sufficient financial resources for this purpose :
in Paraguay it is seen as part of human relationships .
&quot; here a change must take place , so that violence is no longer considered to be a bit of Nor@@ mal . &quot;
&quot; those who are silent in view of these facts makes themselves guilty , and contributes to the perpetrators of the perpetrators . &quot;
we need to refund such a long ad until distr@@ action is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted at the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . previously , parts of the law had been modified . among other things , one passage was painted , which called the partners in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions about the changes are going to be apart .
&quot; the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor , to attack his victim again . &quot;
&quot; however , the devi@@ ation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in O@@ man continued to be attacked a year after prohibition of a newspaper
&quot; this website was blocked because of a compl@@ ain@@ ant of the information minister , is listed on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
more than one year ago the om@@ anic authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their coverage about corruption in the Sultan .
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he / she is a prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and put before judgment , but later returned . &quot;
&quot; O@@ man has been governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn s@@ aid since 1970 , when he came to power after he had put his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a state . &quot;
&quot; since then he ar@@ ra@@ yed , in addition to his role as the only sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Minister of Defence , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the domination of the Sultan is characterized by the persistent efforts of security forces , especially domestic freedom , including press freedom , limiting and human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists , to intimi@@ date and in@@ vert . &quot;
&quot; the authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights systematically and prevent citizens , also activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , closing and detention of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported on corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) , until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , fixed , after in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 was an article entitled &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties &quot; hands of the judiciary &quot; . in this it was about corruption in the judiciary and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report government officials acc@@ ents , judges of the Supreme Court of O@@ man to have put under pressure , to raise a judgment in a inheritance dispute . &quot;
&quot; edition of the Az@@ am@@ n Zeitung on 26 July 2016 , with a report on the front page with the title : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of the judiciary . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , was transferred from the ISS before the Special Department and was arrested on his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
on 9 August 2016 the ISS chief of the Vice @-@ chief of the Al @-@ Ha@@ j had accepted as the chief editor to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
&quot; the newspaper was closed at un@@ certain time after the Information Minister had given the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 banned . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the court condemned the three journalists to prison terms and also set the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were condemned both among other things because of the dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; under@@ mining of the Pres@@ ent of the State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a public ban and the s@@ lan@@ der . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year imprisonment and monetary policy in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
&quot; al @-@ Abr@@ i was condemned to a year prison and fin@@ ed in the amount of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2@@ 600 US dollars ) , after making use of a information network for the distribution of material that could pose a threat to public order &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a b@@ ail was established in the amount of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and he was released on 22 August 2016 prior to the pronoun@@ cement of the Jud@@ gment . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court addressed Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , however , condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months of prison . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 , after the completion of his six months imprisonment . al @-@ Ha@@ j continues to be in prison , where he had al@@ lied his one @-@ year prison sentence . &quot;
the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper continues to be exposed to attack by the Israeli government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information Administration made an assignment with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information Administration was personally signed by a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with what the ministers asked another time against the decision of the Appe@@ al Court , the publication of the newspaper again . &quot;
the constant closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in O@@ man in recent times the press freedom was injured .
&quot; for other violations , the closing of the website of the independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country , are its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the constant closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the extensive injury of the press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities on : &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally available ;
&quot; 2 . to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their jobs ; &quot;
3 . protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances , to ensure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in O@@ man prevented their legitimate rights work , and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judicial ra@@ ils . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ state organization , the human rights defen@@ ders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf Region and the right to gather peace@@ fully , supports and provide protection to them . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or 2016 in Zambia . illustration takes place with its consent
medical research in Africa is rarely or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; there are two reasons for the need for medical research , there are two reasons : for a lack in the offer of global healthcare , many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria have far more serious implications than elsewhere , and lack investment for research on these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; second , research , which is conducted by African scientists , in building own research capacity in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors is director of the centr@@ al@@ or at the center for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic showed first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he for@@ so@@ ok Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania he explored himself on HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ b health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ ors discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of the media about this research . &quot;
( Dis@@ claimer : Dr. Warri@@ ors speaks as a private ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ pled national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with lab tests .
&quot; in addition , I have just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens . &quot;
G@@ V : what do you think are the important current issues in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
r@@ w : there are no basic research here . we only set solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always remain recei@@ vers , instead of being creators . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get , are often not well used in our environment and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
G@@ V : where does the finance and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
r@@ w : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are being developed differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , as financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : what is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
&quot; r@@ w : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory materials is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; r@@ w : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa and what should it concentrate and how can we support development ?
r@@ w : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
G@@ V : can you describe the advantages and cons of life as a scientist in Africa across Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; r@@ w : often it is the limited speed , things to do and the created access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system , that magazines are only accessible to payment ( the so called &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; ) , also limit the amount of available information and speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this entry by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky originally appeared on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding in the United States since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ im@@ memorial , the first plant grown by NASA astronom@@ au@@ ts in space and consumed . &quot;
&quot; for nearly 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work became only through its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question how many sal@@ ads can get , borders . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noted that more and more sal@@ ads have been patented and that he could not use them further . &quot;
&quot; the patents devi@@ ded not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resili@@ ency to diseases , a special red or green or bent leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more such patents have been registered in more and more plants like grain or cart@@ els . due to these trends , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts have been committed to food safety in order to ensure the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of ancient tradition , Mor@@ ton is still salad , it takes no longer time because his work is getting more and more difficult due to getting more restrictions . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if in a river there is a rocky bro@@ ws to which I have to p@@ add@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; so we have to do this now , but it is a break with the breeding @-@ tradition , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; I think these patents go far at sal@@ ads . &quot;
&quot; and when they with@@ stand judgment , no one can breed any more a new salad , because all the features are already patented . so doing so good as possible and try to breed the characteristics that he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and strives to use no material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
&quot; he has also connected with a movement that is getting bigger in the US and anywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Sp@@ ines ISS have bred red tubes in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of greenhouse . the station is bred and eaten . there , there will be tested whether plants in space can be cultivated . &quot;

&quot; it is not a coincidence that this name is rather like that , when the movement came from the IT area , and not from the area of plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copyri@@ ghted software . &quot;
&quot; it was brought into life to ensure that some plant types and gens are not protected as intellectual property , and thus usable for plant breeders . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , just called O@@ ss@@ i , U.S. bre@@ eder can also ple@@ dge that others may use the seed of seeds from them . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed , and sell it . &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; breeders only allow others to breed their seeds , to breed such as own varieties , and it does not immediately send - two aspects that are banned by many plant pat@@ ents or prescribed . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seeds have joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; Professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i @-@ Board members , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to him , seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by increasing seeds with natural resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasises that the &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; movement did not work with genetically modified plants . &quot;
&quot; all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , Korean , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; &quot; to buy our goal of ecological sustainability , the most recent examples could be bought in the global agricultural industry , such as the recent examples the mer@@ ging of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Monsanto , and Bayer , should also know that the way it is cultivated in markets , such as these vegetables is bred . &quot;
&quot; nutrition sovereign without seed @-@ sovereign is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative are committed to providing others to their seeds , and to patent their course in contrast , seeds and plant @-@ characteristics . &quot;
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered because the available Gen@@ pool is due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always restricted , inc@@ ess@@ ant p@@ umping . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , employed in their doctoral work with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . it found out that about a third of all cart@@ els as intellectual property is protected , thus making it usable for plant breeders either at all or only . &quot;
&quot; there are such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants as wheat in an even larger style are patented as salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants become so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from those , through which their taste or colour improves up to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments , and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties show that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to increasingly more patents . however , genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changing conditions are much worse due to climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Monsanto inter@@ acting in C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to that genetic variety is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four pleasures and the cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the United States , the company is set up for the preservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts that intellectual property is restric@@ ts to other bre@@ eder because &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ etal innovations promote &quot; . &quot; a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow once the patent is exp@@ ired . &quot;
often these instructions can help others to come with another method of the same result .
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovations not , but supports them by giving the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton looks different : 20 years of waiting for a patent , it certainly does not make innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you need to wait for such a long time to breed plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , the struggle would have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ular incentives are not appealing to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
this is what motiv@@ ates us and it will be impossible if we continue to use the best and newest genetic resources .
&quot; in all , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept in itself , plant @-@ characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the features ourselves . &quot;
the plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol land@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i @-@ board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who grow a variety also grow its own values into it . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with big farms and mon@@ ok@@ ul@@ tures , which are needed for their cultivation mass @-@ wise her@@ bi@@ cides , will be breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is accurate . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are moving on international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto are patents ) , they create the most smaller seed companies , even without patents , either reject the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant breeders Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for in his breeding garden sal@@ ads .
photo by Karen Mor@@ ton .
&quot; Mor@@ ton is also the view that breeders from the A@@ void of plant pat@@ enting innovative would : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies , the patent . &quot;
&quot; I need to constantly have new material for my catalogue , since I know my competitors being sold my varieties in a couple of years ago , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected for 20 years ahead of competition with which you think it &apos;s quite nice to do . &quot;
&quot; while the US seem to be leaders in the &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; breeding , but the concept is spreading rapidly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India the Center for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , describes a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . &quot; to preserve the seeds of traditional farm crops , the center with farmers is working together and helps them meet new varieties that meet specific requirements . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed and sell their own .
&quot; the German Organization in col works on an &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; license that is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i @-@ Commit@@ ment for breeders in the European Union . &quot;
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country where the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply become one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive powers of the European Union , the European Commission , explains that conven@@ tionally re @-@ bred plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European patent office which patents on conventional crops . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is at the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , to farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives from all East Africa to learn something about the &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; movement and the worldwide trend to pat@@ enting seed . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems that the organisation currently creates a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , for the planned next year the official start @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; a consortium of environmental and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity worldwide in order to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a group of aid organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report published . in this , it represents the possibility that farmers have the opportunity to improve seeds , to exchange and improve seed policy so that it can ensure stable supply of food . &quot;
&quot; the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection from the Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hopes that soon more people will be recognized . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has especially respected where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role in doing so , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their foods . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest objectives of the cens@@ orship in Egypt
still un@@ locking the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
&quot; this time , it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ nis@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the weekend of the 05.@@ 10 , the Egyptian government writes the website of the Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on sel@@ enium . &quot;
&quot; August , the network published an opinion on Facebook in which it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; in spite of this attack and the adoption of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , whom the law should be defending , to overcome speech and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I have never been so difficult as now . AN@@ HR@@ I have never been so difficult to overcome these goals in order to overcome the block@@ age and not to prove it . we ins@@ ists to fulfil our task further . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered to be the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities block the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ speaking issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the funded network of Al Jazeera because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I also , there is no access to the blog of the colum@@ nis@@ ts and human rights research scientist Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for spreading colum@@ nis@@ ts and articles , which he writes not accessible websites and media in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , which he set up to deal with the cens@@ ored apparatus of the Egyptian government , even aim of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ g@@ gers , who is home to the name of Zi@@ adas blog , on the other hand is more accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , has spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video like police violence against two students . &quot;
his article mainly revol@@ ve around politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed himself to the block through the government and reflec@@ tive what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the blogs to lock is very old , however , has been priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ ally al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the block of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is however for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been able to convey to me the feeling of a si@@ ege condition ; one arrest , a attempted murder , over@@ loading at the national Security Council , the block@@ age blogs as well as any other web site for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience . &quot;
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post articles in order to avoid the cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; but now , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mu@@ ff@@ ing go the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Thou@@ ght and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites , including Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE also documented the block of vendors , through the conversion of uni@@ formity and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the block of websites , the V@@ P@@ N@@ s , began . &quot;
&quot; such practice points to the intention of the government to block and filter content , to access the Egyptian users . &quot;
&quot; the situation will additionally be worse that the cens@@ ored decisions have been made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which it can proceed against these actions . &quot;
&quot; now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ orship , and who will attack them next ? &quot;
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

&quot; day after day , newspapers report in all Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous post@@ cards . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school is shot , &quot; &quot; every second day there will be a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; th@@ iev@@ ing pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sent 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air @-@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the highest standards in Rio achieved the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian government of Global Justice even called the United Nations to intervene .
reports such as these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least find the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; published for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16th August the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; , &quot; in which they announced , a new column called &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now being published .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city in the world like murder , rob@@ bery , sexual ab@@ ort , etc . everything , which however happened by the civili@@ zed standard and what happened only in Rio , is not normal in the heading &quot; war in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we as a journalist do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ ards , the chief editor of the newspaper , that this decision is not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure . &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not realize war at all .
&quot; in the same video a journalist &apos;s newspaper explains that according to data from the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , 8@@ 43 areas , there is crimin@@ ality controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
in the editorial the newspaper writes on :
&quot; we realize that a war rate , if it is distorted , too , atro@@ cities of the police that only sho@@ ots and then ask questions to conce@@ al . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and their partners . &quot;
does the name &quot; war &quot; more than they use@@ t ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasi@@ l , the journalist of Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , to call violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsibility in the police . &quot;
this is not war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military deployment in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ suffici@@ ency of public service . &quot;
to memory : the federal state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital .

&quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia is wrong : &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 non @-@ violent cities in Brazil , according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most current data . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per federal state , Rio is up to No. 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the biggest media company South America , which stresses as Cec@@ í@@ lia , has repeatedly stressed the security policy of the state . &quot;
&quot; the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a Fav@@ ela by employing a massive police officers and to create a unit permanently there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually resulted in a decrease of violent deaths . for some years now , the U@@ PP was supposed to protect over Shi@@ kan@@ en and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor municipalities which actually should protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his fac@@ ebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux made out of one of his articles from the year 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio does not set the - through the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war is also serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; for this demands the state to use the means and paths that are typical for a war . therefore the penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil is an un@@ sharp point in the countryside and becomes the object for &quot; col@@ lateral damages &quot; and &quot; ver@@ ted balls . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war in or her , fact is that the inhabitants of Fav@@ elas continue to suffer in Rio . &quot;
&quot; a week now , it is now that the police officers joined the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , to betra@@ y the death of a poli@@ cem@@ an . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all these violence , this incident took head@@ lines : a fruit res@@ eller died as a result of shots that had fired the police from a helicopter . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victory Watch , a joint initiative by the Peace Organization Pa@@ x and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently about a million Syrians in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; the region of Eastern G@@ hou@@ ta is particularly affected by the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta , where the attack was called by hundreds of civilians on August 21 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of studies by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was practiced by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebels have been controlled by rebels outside Damascus under si@@ ege , which led to inhabitants on the local or through tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; through years of long block@@ ages , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tainable for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and academics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ ta , how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ ou@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to the traditional ones in Syria , they are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , they are very rare , however , makes them an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besi@@ eged east G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the Right of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said opposite the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultivate the cultivation of fungi because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that has been fought for three years to make this project well @-@ known and expressed its relief that there is now more and more &quot; awareness . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , take advantage by the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ ou@@ as the humanitarian Cro@@ w@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge to planting mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12.@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect from Monday , 04 . September 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is dependent on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity in 80 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the fuel market , locally installed fuel imports will be used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with &quot; production &quot; from the regions of the region , before they check their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom in a tub . when this was , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
&quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have been distributed to mushrooms all over the East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for different reasons &quot; : break in the si@@ ege . &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
&quot; distribution of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , by eating remains ( such as paper , tea , coffee maker , cardboard , etc ) to create new foods . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their homes .
he said : &quot; we hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the si@@ ege is visible .
we want our experience to be inspired by people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese calls for justice for victims of fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts of cities in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires that are r@@ amp@@ ant in the north of Portugal .
&quot; forty @-@ two people died , and approximately 70 were injured due to the forest fires of 15 and 16 . this led to the government last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days . &quot;
fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region where there were 4 dead .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ breaks , spread out in the northern and centrally located regions of the country and reached around 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June occurred in Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European fores@@ try system , which monitors the forest @-@ surfaces per satellite recordings , alone in Portugal alone about 500,000 hectares of forest burned - an area of the size of the district Lisbon . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation : there is only no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; Portugal burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) 15th October , 2017 &quot;

the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the goal of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better defence and fire fighting actions by the state .
people asked why civil protection was not able to include the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
João Sover@@ al from the Confederation of farmers of Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; according to Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
&quot; this Sunday they did so anywhere , there are Danish reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen as in June as the streets were blocked very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , building permits are questioned with high fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a wide @-@ sufficient proposal for the re@@ for@@ ging form , which the government had earned after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ection@@ able by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law that allowed the B@@ aut@@ ology of case permitted , if the applicant was permitted by means of self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door so that everything was built , &quot; João Sor@@ val leads to the same article in the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us made aware that large areas with Eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees made from slightly inflamm@@ able wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this species . &quot;
&quot; to these problems arise that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as resident &apos;s information sought or tried to contact relatives , offline was . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used the own civilian protection data with the application fo@@ g@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João P@@ ina , in order to simplify the work of fire bri@@ ga@@ des and was followed at this f@@ ateful weekend in October so that the servers followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users , who kept the fires there more than half a million access . &quot;

&quot; Ab@@ du@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara dom@@ ed party of E@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt un@@ spo@@ ilt . &quot;
the Taliban known for their hatred on the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban came closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; some days after his escape , A@@ carto@@ af found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
he worked in a coal @-@ pit for a few years . work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left of his minor wages , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and s@@ lugg@@ ish bags with mor@@ tar , which were he@@ avier than he himself , in order to make his living . &quot;
&quot; then , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees were shaped by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , A@@ carto@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( af@@ gh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the job@@ site where we also worked . &quot;
there was no services and no heating . we attached n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we were not dro@@ wned at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ carto@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made themselves ready for travel to Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ gely on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected its asylum application , A@@ carto@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time was homeless , homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church who distributed twice the day eating in aid . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy due to relatively high proportion quot@@ as is a sort of second chance for exp@@ ired asylum seekers . it is true , however , that the conditions that are asylum seekers in the country can be disastrous . &quot;
the human rights organisation civil liberties Union for Europe writes the system &quot; suffer from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of the asylum seekers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; it is impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law asylum seekers can only be assigned to an admission center , if they officially have submitted an application for asylum - which can go after the registration of asylum for asylum . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was also called A@@ carto@@ af .
&quot; but his unpleasant o@@ ath helped A@@ carto@@ af , to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions soon . &quot;
&quot; after spending several years in the building sector , A@@ carto@@ af tasted his entire savings on the creation of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that after a while he still opened a second hostel and a schn@@ el@@ lim@@ p .
&quot; A@@ carto@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject of the documentary &quot; &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di . &quot;
&quot; the film won the Venice City Award , which has been awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italians - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to in@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some of the Afgh@@ ans established companies , including cutting plants , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Experience Experience , where the waiter and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the restaurant &apos;s menu is told by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the history of their journey to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; however , A@@ carto@@ af@@ s &apos;s goals reach far beyond the Italian Ga@@ stronom@@ ical market and the retail trade and aim back to the country , which he had to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ carto@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forget my country and I cannot live happily if I know that my people suffer .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces in the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and need to get the same possibilities as everyone else .
&quot; A@@ carto@@ af also cuts plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and counter techniques . &quot; this way , they can sell their seriousness on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development for successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but at the end are stability and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; A@@ carto@@ af has made this journey itself , and now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path . &quot;
&quot; Ne@@ wark Report : legal accus@@ ations from Egypt permit de@@ preci@@ ation of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , since more than 900 days in custody . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clear@@ ance of the camp of Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ olith@@ ic report is an international snapshot , the challenges , victories and upcoming trends in worldwide inter@@ ne@@ ties shows &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian Parliament checks a legal draft , which indicates that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after a registration at a governmental authority . &quot;
&quot; users would have to be able to use social networks within six months after the successful rule of law , on the website of the authority under specification of their full name , as well as their reference number . &quot;
who dreams of this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the final payment of a criminal payment .
&quot; the law , which was applied by sixty parliamentary members , is currently legislative and constitutional Committee of the Parliament , and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of the European Parliament adopted a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tougher sanctions for the ins@@ ult of the president or the high officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the insul@@ ting of the President as well as state institutions is already stra@@ in@@ able . however , under the law proposition , such a matter would act with prisons and monetary policy , so right @-@ wing of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be adopted , this can mean up to three years in prison for the crimes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would be a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) which was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated violence against prot@@ esters who demonstrated against military coup , who led to minister of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; sha@@ w@@ kan waited , just as more than 700 Protest@@ ants who were arrested in the same incident , four years in jail for a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postponed due to the 20th May because the prison guidance according to human rights groups fell to the accused of bringing the accused of prison in the court hall . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threatens the death penalty due to a so many human rights groups , head@@ load from among others arms , illegal gathering , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
in another case a criminal tribunal in G@@ iza spoke to two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo .
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , which were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunisian activists to per@@ v@@ aded documents
&quot; may , Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ pol@@ r of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was primarily breaking down by the President of the Republic , which was explicitly supported by the President of the Republic , according to the Plan , by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption accused officers of Am@@ nesty , provided that these were all un@@ lawful preser@@ v@@ ative funds . &quot;
&quot; published on April 21st , on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , casts a light on how the presidential plans to support the law situation look like . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia authorized the disclosure of its sources under indication of Article 11 of the Tunisian press freedom , which secur@@ es journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 May as a witness in the case . &quot;
will China force the user of social media to present their account ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the Office of the People &apos;s Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media need permission before they write or share news in social media . &quot;
&quot; in the regulation , it is also stated that registration will be necessary with full real name . &quot;
analy@@ st suspect that this is to be achieved by the elimination of anonymous comments in discussions within the social networks . it is up to now unclear how the authorities apply these regulations .
&quot; Chinese network citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these provisions only , in order to protect citizens &apos; journ@@ alism and independence . &quot;
then we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state cens@@ orship of Russia the state cens@@ orship of Russia &apos;s access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or reconc@@ iled We@@ chat , to register in the national government as an &quot; organizer of the information broad@@ casts . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this name is part of a law issued by 2014 , thanks to which the Russian Government will conduct a list of online services that allows the &quot; publication of the information &quot; . &quot; the law also allows the government to be responsible for removing content and to force them on request for suspension of user data . &quot;
&quot; these web pages are currently on websites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ is@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service Mail@@ .ru , and de@@ contamination of other services . &quot;
Turkish dish has Sper@@ isen Wikipedi@@ as
&quot; a tur@@ quoise court ordered the block Wikipedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ speaking articles , the information , Turkey support the jihadists in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and Communication existed , the site was blocked because it works to &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups in order to provide a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is therefore , next to China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain can not stop making her@@ al@@ ble
&quot; following this week , the Great Britain is located in the midst of targeted consultation regarding increased surveillance of surveillance , the internet service provider would force to monitor communications in real time and to install back@@ door programs , en@@ code data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has been consul@@ ted in telecommunications companies and intelligence services , but has left other technological companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until the 19th of May . responses and proposals from the members of the public can be forwarded to the Interior Ministry . &quot;
