<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is exceptionally large.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I grew up with American films, I danced to American music, American authors read and run his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had a very profound impact on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"when I was 14 years old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter, who with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Stued covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnating with judges who were interested to occupy their interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," I was, as if the absolute truth is, forget everything else, this is what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year that I lived in Arizona, I had only strengthened my admiration for the USA."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting you can always be the one you are and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very blackish love letter written about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his narrow-minded.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops his opinion behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and openly explains his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and Women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in favor of him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes which he won in the Republican elections, was the highest number, which ever reached by the Party nomination candidate."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigote person I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I was able to get Trump and his voters with the people I had to know during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the journalist programme, the people from all over the world, a deeply smooth person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the trumps of world views not coincided with the author of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer "." "</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I had met our common love for basketball, and we spent many hours to watch the" Phoenix Suns "in the game."</seg>
<seg id="25">"tracumps intolerant is also in contrast to the generosity that I had during Sandy Bahr which fights her life for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me as their son."</seg>
<seg id="26">She is still adapting to the involvement of Kristi Kappes who always with a lot of patience and grace helped me and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">"then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice has helped me a lot during my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values of them embodied my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"as Trump of his way to nominees for Republican candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contempt for non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the discussion with the idea that people voted for trump because they either shared its racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, I broke down almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it is unfair to call the trump voter than racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to classify people, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficial and respectful, and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of which are white, voted for trump because they would like to rewin control of a country that has disappointed it?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who look down with contempt for those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" "whitelash" "(Anm d. WC.: as much as" drawing the White against all other ethnicities ";" word game from white in touch on the White and whiplash, which means so much as chiddertrauma), as it was called the great Van Jones, has just killed what America has done so great. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people all over the world appreciate American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - what faith or background you like, America is always welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyaners whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"however, with the election of Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the white America this promise to and says: to hell with multiple freedom, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is again on the ruin, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word-change with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the quantity replied with a silently" "No!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" "brood the amount."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do you have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" "answering them."</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" "they called and their voices were louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"could anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">"he received a consistent and silently" "NO" "!"</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan closed with words," "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the country, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Country," "said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="70">"the music that is played at both places, not only the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the brink of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular among the tourists -but worlds away from the nearby magnificent ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for several years now, La Banda de MÃºsica (music bande) has been playing in the municipality: one of children and adults-existing symphony orchestras, which has found a way to overcome them."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community that is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico is known for its drugs abuse and gangs force.</seg>
<seg id="77">"but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project and offered the youth so a rare hope of hope."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young bandmembers take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press notcias Oaxaca NVI."</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to go to their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">"they come and play with sparkling eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, Oboe, flute, forest horn, Pauke, Bongo and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay's capital - on instruments that are made of recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with recurrent instruments, which consist of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for music instruments in Cateura where the recycled under the direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez began to transform parts of the breakdown into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"the instruments imitate violas, violas, celli, double bass, guitars, saxes, trumpets, trumpet, trombones, trombones, trombones and percussion, which were all made out of the trash."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classic music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez is a local ecologist and musician instructor of the children of Cateura, at the beginning of time:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first, it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where parents never knew music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them don't live with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something that he had never seen before: one out of waste from the violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is an orchestra which plays on instruments from re-prepared material and called The recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation called "Landfill harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) draws the musical performance to:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And this is where they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspirational spectacle from trash to music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work can fight illegal fishing successfully</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fought the wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practical solutions to environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">Re-release occurs in the context of an agreement with Global Voices to share content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, this ship was known then that this ship had already operated illegal fishing, before it was sought out the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"the East African countries have therefore been raised, accordingly, and little inclined to welcome a legislative brecher of this kind on their shores."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized themselves quickly against the ship. they refused him, one of their harbours and refused to give him a fishing place."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" Ursuddenly, the prime minister was surrounded by countries that just refused it, "Benedict Kiilu, is a leader of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship's time and followed."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of pillage of fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO stop illegally stop (Illegal fisheries)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"the members of this network are of Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that were driven at that time the prime minister from their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" we have eight countries, which are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and are mutually exclusive when it comes to illegal fishing, "" says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable trusts project Ending illegally Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: which is caught, is hidden, absent because it is extremely difficult to record. thus, illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the intentional disrespect of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are supposed to be protected, illegal fishing ecosystems can harm, which have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing once were disabled by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snow-empo, with the information between individual countries are curated, so the actions occur in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, the individual countries can share with other lists of existing licenses, updates on suspicion activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, if these are moving at the open sea, using satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this makes it possible to identify the authorities, ships that fish in the botanical areas. also, you can discover that a ship invites its prisoners of fish on the road to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations may show whether the participating ships have a fish royalty where they were on the road and perhaps, whether they have a penal ister."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries who are opposed to illegal fishing are on basis of this information to refuse the adoption of such ships in their harbours. what means that the ships could not sell their charge. and that they could even be forced to numbers of penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "there is a serious financial loss for the owner, meaning that illegal fishing is financially no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," says Per Erik Bergh, Chief Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i. "</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to gain estimated 20 million USD in lost sales, representing the eight members of the network HISH-i each year due to illegal fishermen who penetrate into East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing villages, which attracts the region's commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also seven illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include actions such as the sailing under false flag, fake license papers, indicating of fantasies, the fish-protected species and the fish in nature conservation areas."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they deliberately utilize the missing international cooperation and make up the weaknesses of a non-organized control system, "says Long." "earlier, a ship was illegal and a country could then say" You darkened my harbour. "</seg>
<seg id="124">"yet another country could say 'Come to me'." "and exactly this allegation hole trying to close FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its foundation FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspects.</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has uncovered criminal networks, which had been distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities, and it has found volatile ships and found."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our studies lead us quite far into the networks organized crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">"he builds a system, which is to help FISH-i, suspects ships more precise."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with kind permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"Fish-i's satellite system, which is always further developed, also helps to split the illegal ships that are happy to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and position, "" says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships also turn off their automatic identification systems, which they can no longer figure out of satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland helps to build a system that connects various information levels with each other. it aims to help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">One model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team African nations actually influence influence on the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened together with Google and the protection organization Oceana, the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite channels and can be displayed via the position of each traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" join together with neighbours to get a better picture of who what to do - this simply makes sense, "" he says. "" here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global level." "Pew Charitable trusts have allowed a similar project in which a global system permits the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only felt in criminals, but also deterred."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships used to confiscated previously without a license and hardly expected to reckon with consequences, now they know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating to FISH-i have now captured a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fishing boats can buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped, Greko 1 found, the inspectors found there on board Schleppnets, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with kind permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strongly that we now also copy other countries", "says Kiilu." "we are a study subject." "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries joined together, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are now fighting illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "With certainty, the goal is to make even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia opened its first big triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship which was under false flag on the road. and not only was the ship used without a license and were used towing grids which meanwhile were prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated in botanical waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong signal that they go against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is a further success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special, collaborative way of work on the protection of the oceans actually works throughout the world. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London. there she writes about environment, technique and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">There the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">"I spying in, and saw a couch that were tortured on men."</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field-bed and metal-springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached to the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was just captivated there.</seg>

<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible only that a person can do so much suffering from another?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew that these people were killed '</seg>

<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know that because my father told me at home.</seg>

<seg id="264">"here, their names were changed and they got a number assigned as part of the process of dehumanization."</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived torture, the prisoners were cast into the cuadra until the order of the top came, that they should be moved."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for passage, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the text text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is the case with native language. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - maternity language."</seg>
<seg id="379">"this is how a French motherlanguage translate into French, for example from English to French - not from French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies employ no employees with English as a mother tongue, translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding for survival, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers, to learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies that even do not have foreign employees, have translations yet to be completed. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best to be done - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"worralled and puzzling phrases that arise through machine translation, show that this technique can hardly be replaced by human translators for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strange English wordings in Japan, including the puzzling prints, often used as t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>

<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless. however, by large companies or the government that have the resources to ensure higher standards can be carefully checked."</seg>

<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money passes their underage son or her inferior daughter to another, richer family. in exchange the child will receive food, training and roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"what does not mention, however, is that the children must do countless days of house work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse may be - and all that within the framework of a treaty which you can not lift up."</seg>
<seg id="425">This is widely used as Criadazgo practice in Paraguay on the basis of participation and acceptance by large sections of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">"after completing their studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization dedicated to the rights of the boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she spoke with Criadita, especially young girls affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - gathered testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to call things on behalf of name, because the sense of gratitude that is vaccinated to the Criadita in general, is guaranteed to be silent in general."</seg>

<seg id="430">"on the one hand, the family, who is her daughter in faith, that she is able to complete their education, improve their position in society, and" "can do something out of itself", "to another family."</seg>

<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian Parliaments have recently agreed a bill for "regulations regarding the use and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"when he is accepted by the Parliament, commercial and user can register social media in Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, then a place would be set up, which is in charge of using citizens and to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months with the adoption of the law, beneficiaries and users must register on the site of the site with their right names and staff members to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it is failed to do so, this could be a penalty of up to six months in prison or a wager with them."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill's draft which consists of six Paragrafen and curated in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" "jedwede application, which runs and used over the Internet to communicate with others through voice, video, and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law will be enforced when the draft is not assumed, as the draft authorities are not suggesting how Egyptian authorities are not able to register the registration, which does not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, Parliament's parliamentarians and sponsors of the legislative situation, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered user names and users received a username and a password to come through the firewall to block the Facebook."</seg>

<seg id="511">But it is not known so far that such plans do exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on the spot are sceptical regarding the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>

<seg id="516">"take it seriously, this means that they will establish a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not. and that means a mad system to monitor the activities of the people and also to lead them into a judicial process."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed in the legislative Parliament and the constitutional committees, before it goes into the plenary session."</seg>

<seg id="544">"at the beginning of March 2017, documenting the progress made for the Northeast of Japan, the progress made for the North-east of Japan. a tremendous earthquake, a Tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the disaster."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a etaker's prefecture in Japan northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring villages of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate because the tsunami had fallen whole coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"even in addition, the Fukushima Prefecture had an atomic accident, already alone because of that, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows the progress six years after that progress has been reached in order to re-rebuild the local communities.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the paper includes both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of those concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reported that by December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare houses (Centuries),, saigai kouei juutchu) were completed in the preftures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"the biggest success among the three preftures was Miyagi, here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima is laid down by 70 percent of the final light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"however, one always makes every effort to re-evacuate six years after the catastrophe, evacuated from Behelfsacshelters (IV), casetsu itutaku) in final replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in homes."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such accommodation units."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 per cent of the evacuated from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 per cent of evacuated, who were home after disaster in homes, were settled in final houses."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the number is here by 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of works and everyday life in the three affected preftures.</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by the disaster, opened their doors to December 2016, which constitutes nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, industrial reconstruction in the three prefecture is far more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while nearly 100 percent of the fishery in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation again, at Fukushima only 30 percent of the fishery have resumed their operations."</seg>
<seg id="563">"the tsunami and the atomic accident, have attracted large-scale in the three prefecture of agricultural land."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi managed to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent of agricultural arable land in Fukushima again."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a result of the nuclear failure, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of agricultural arable land of Fukushima, are located in the" nuclear wave zone. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three preftures, tourism has recovered, but again Fukushima still remains beaten."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwates are again at 90 percent at the same level as before disaster. Fukushima however, here, can only have 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it's harder to earn their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"to determine an overall picture, the newspaper led numerous surveys under the native population and among the evacuated. she asked her about the status of rebuilding and also how their rebellion has changed to the tsunami risk."</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey in order to get more about the tsunami consciousness under the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of the respondents find that still not enough in catastrophes prevention has not been done."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to evacuated the Fukushima Prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="576">"in their edition to the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also strengthened its attention on the position of evacuated from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima not only had to experience the enormous earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness of the worst, disastrous, atomic accident, the Japan had ever had to experience."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 there were some more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after 2017, we still live 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima off their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the catastrophenols areas, most of the evacuated areas are fewer than 50 years old. they have failed to bring efforts to rebuild the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. here it is construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games to be held in Tokyo."</seg>

<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, since 2014 workshop managers bring mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centers, to teach young people songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were guided by the pedagogues David Hodges who lives in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree Hip Hop group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop is increasing that the young participants in interviews like" cultural identity, speech, engagement, love, self-acceptance "or whatever has always been found in the sense."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youth are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia tells the story of the Highway 16, also called" highway of tears ", at which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>

<seg id="702">"in the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung in Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip Hop group who gave them a strophe in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">"at the Facebookside of N'we Jinan, the strophe is available in writing, as well a translation into English that is translated here into German:"</seg>

<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, are exhibited in the proximity of the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (in the column)," "Plastic models of dishes" ") of each food that is served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers watch these plastic meals and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic meals.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the tokier district of Kappabashi there are a variety of these small businesses that produce even those plastic dishes, which was documented by the German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese people, these plastic meals are so common that they do not even find out more of them. however, a new trend is turning into conspicuous phone accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">"at Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published series of Social Media Links and Photos, which show this unusual twist with the shove sanpuru."</seg>

<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing dock.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some cell phones and mobile phone designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork. in this case ikura or salmon-oestrogen is used, a popular plate, which is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"is there someone who would say:" wow, cool, now I can put my cell phone with salmon-oestrogen? "</seg>
<seg id="738">I believe I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic stores can also take a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our newest cell-handed has the shape of melon ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also travel balls (onigiri), earrings and handybands from dried salmon."</seg>

<seg id="752">"there are behind any corpse, behind each bone fund in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories paid by their parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds might never heal."</seg>
<seg id="753">"therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico introduced the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" with the drug trade life), which aims to give these victims a voice and told the stories of people who were involved in the struggle between law enforcement authorities and cartels.

<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who disgusted or sad. it seems like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent with it or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10-year old Cousin thinks he is Narco (German: drug dealers) if it is great. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the" heroism "of offenders if they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me it is that, as if they rotate those who have lost anyone and those who fear that they have happened so something too."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories are bloating numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the insomnia of men is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students can be justified in a neighbourhood so that they were" "shopping cart". ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they are trying to engage themselves, that they remain spared by such tragedies if they are not stirring and quiet."</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "four months of blackmail in the main city district: how a family with threats has been looted out for month to money from their business until they were destroyed not only the business but also their family had to be torn apart.</seg>

<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a guard and he tells that he himself had to teach himself how to cook a egg, potatoes, tortillas warm and" Chichi "for the babies with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">"but they are insignificant compared to pain in his eyes - inspeakable for a boy for all the life of violence, and had to learn to live with it."</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he said that his mother disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">"but this was not the day, in which his childhood ended."</seg>

<seg id="945">Such words are available in each language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unsurpassed words are already well known (like the famous Portuguese sudade) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly to each attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">"one word or expression does not suffice, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context is needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word."</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a long time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">"most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and Linguist of" Untranslatable "Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages."</seg>
<seg id="951">"for example, in the blog you can find words from the Mwot- language of Vanuatu, as:"</seg>
<seg id="952">Vakasteglok - salute you to your parents in recognition of how to have tried you in your recent years.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to connect here and now despite a language barrier with someone?</seg>
<seg id="1137">"for Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) the experience of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"global Voices reported recently, above another initiative of Steven Bird, the unbridgeable blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"however, the focus of TLS is not on the written words, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of big cities."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already conducted events, the risk that small and not quite as small languages will not be passed on to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project apply:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that do not accept diversity, safe spaces, where residents do not have to forget who they are."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while listening to it is often related to understanding," this events instead "means" to listen to, to feel, establish. "</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, stories of storyteller will first translate their story in their own language and translate them into English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, they perform their devotion and their representation that the audiences can turn on it."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They give laughter and emotions as the language no longer be a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video shows for example a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narration for their country."</seg>

<seg id="1207">"perhaps none of Bassels cultural prototypes predicted the work that he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites of the world, was the crossroads from numerous civilizations and here the Greek-Roman architectural types with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS had everything about it, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip-train into the digital archaeology and conservation has created a time of time which will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>

<seg id="1218">Bassel opened my door to technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other incarnations as they use computers, at least theoretically, without having actually held one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (waiting), a prosabotage, which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody."</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mozambians reacted with wrath on a corruption case in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence on which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">"the Diodino Cambaza, which was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 along with four other defendants (about 800 000 Euros)."</seg>

<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called his re-setting into the company, which happened on 19 April then."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with an opinion of the general state-state Office of the Republic, which expires the request, there would be no obstacles to Cambaza to return to its old post, as the company did not complete a disciplinarity after his detention."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants do not say good."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, shortly CIP), a local institution, committed to public transparency, condemned in an interview with the Deutsche Welle the decision of the company, the director again:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"establishes a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step forward with regard to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that even the company should have been guided by a discipline against the conflicting.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the firm apparently appears and prompted no adequate legal steps to use the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mosambian social media, rejects this behavior as well and considers the case as" conflicting. ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to prison sentence and half of them were picked up."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could hold lectures and motivating speeches, he might advise and his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he has agreed to be integrated into the company that he helped to cause damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, young Mosambians and student of political sciences in Brazil says, the director had no morality."</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he inquired him I cannot believe someone in such a way that the state has already been so massive.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks morality and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead it only served itself by the state itself."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as handmade, it's an inexhaustible money source and the state itself has become tired of this man who has been charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence."</seg>

<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to information from Facebook users in Myanmar the well-known Social Network took their Posts out of the net because they had the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people ostindian origin or generally used as an adjective."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar", "or the" "Kalar" "(in Burmical script) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radical nationalistic movements gave the word an extremely downcast connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar's may usually be associated with racism, but the word itself is not automatically called hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also Posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed for its use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"moreover, there are several burmesous words with all the different meanings, which have the same letter as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written in Burmisch also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar Pae' (Spage), 'Kalar oat' (camel) or 'calarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooker Aung Kaung Myat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends has been deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in a spiritual way whether she knew how to alleviate his back pain by doing a word game."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the phrase ku la -" "healing" "(ku) + the fraword (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"in Win Htet is the opinion that it will diminish hate speech radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook should be analytic before it all posts to spread racism that are suspicion of racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automation is not understood what you write to factook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, is the post to carefully analyze and control him by checking the words right next."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example" "Kalar Htine" "(chair) and" "Kalar Pae". ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these dirty nationalists are spread, the hate speech, a pretty good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">"now, it is time to circumcised its nationalism."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to everyone, disseminating the hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and Wechat have proven that the censorship of perceivers is often a tatz- and mouse game, whereby users use social networks to simply use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author of Aung's Kaath described how Facebook began to delete his posts, when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banished from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was attentive to this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook and I banned the Liken, post and sharing of content for 24 hours because of the post" "Facebook community standards". ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posts of people that have no negative intentions or which simply try to show off their opinions against hate speech radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post office without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author shared his mind about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more than the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a benevolent intention to decrease racism in Burma through their platform but so it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">To censoring such words just more hate within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and so words as" "chair" "or" "inheritance curry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found that they made mistakes, they didn't try to correct the falsified Posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they would only have a little more respect for the 15 million benefits, which would give them a great turnover, it would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has provided a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users are now taking over Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their Posts are taken from the net."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots from Facebook's posts, which had no hate speech, but still removed:"</seg>

<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks is to attack the violence in Burma in addition to heat, especially in Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to escape."</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his failure to bring the expressiveness of hate on his Burmese sides under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of simply thinking the word 'Kalar', it would have been better running in context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and is committed to the exploitation of the Patriarchate."</seg>

<seg id="1480">They reported how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini was shown in its discussion, was of women who do not name their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem that women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"speaking the name of her husbands is not to be utterance, it is a bread, which they kept all guilty and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman respects her husband and wish him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not hold this, is considered a histig, as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought so far to this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning of Rohini, who had never named her husband before name, trying at home as it works."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband smiled for a long time after the video was finished.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"internash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini launched its first discussion."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate "never before. some believed it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to put the discussion with an exercise in motion."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini bat each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can name us how they want, meaning that they do not respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her husbands via the lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the breaks of a centuries-old tradition, in the married women could never pronounce the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she kicked her during the whole exercise only before himself; another decided to let the whole blazing frustration against him and his family by removing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"in the adrenalin rush about it, having broken with an ancient bread, the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their husbands at home."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they counted their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days Rohini received a multitude of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband called a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women in his head: his wife couldn't stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she was stubborn, she got afraid and told that there was an error."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," Rohini said I should do it. "</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband a participant in was less understanding and the situation arted into violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reported how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred spot on the forehead, which indicates the spouses:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would carry the zinnoberred dot when he was doing it too."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughs and I listened to him to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely ceased, but they think they are now in a better position, even to choose him not to carry it in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the debate is a safe place where they can replace their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we do a trip on each panel."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want the women to worry about who could hear what could hear," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months she celebrated her own birthdays with cakes; she danced and sang about things that they had never had thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have spoken about some things, such as our identities to our spouses, never as honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say certain things loud, no matter how small they do."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have taken only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most is the okay, but some wanted a saline spa, a vast shirt over a pants, they did not dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of arguments and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes of clothes, morality linked to the Saris and much more, ornament Rohini her own couple of Curtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion, so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they have now decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can carry jeans and Rohini is certain that they will be able to create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question of whether in the five months since her first discussion, Rohini confirmed that things slowly get into rolls:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then listened to the name of their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do it yet, but only if they are alone and have no other family members."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women bear now at any time Zinnoberrot on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"the women in the debate should know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggle for more freedom of movement or their own clothes, at the end of a difficult to navigating river."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"giving each other self-confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when each woman goes home and told other people what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"however, according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam should be considered Singapore as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark also triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of international branches of the law firm of the Association of New York, the Minister reiterated that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they are compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He support Singapore as a city should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1689">Nobody questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," "rotate logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore. "</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, according to all our efforts and invitations to create this valuable land, we hear that we are ultimately no country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the impression of an escape from the responsibilities, a mandatory breach."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, the country is it?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons mentioned by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended one idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries, given the fact he appeared invariably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore is to be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the core point of the issue, the good old gulf emerges from the authoritarian rulers, who preclues Democrats, leave the twisted logic, since they fit better into their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end of the last week of Shanmugam were given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judictative, our political system really non-replies."</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions tared with non-Answer kind.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng demands Shanmugam to clear his opinion since they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"Singapore is not a country, but a city is, therefore, to which country belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"short, I understand nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clear that point unless it was paid high, in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"publishing on the blog its comment, he points out the critiques to read the whole co-scription of the conference, so that you could understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam better, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the journal.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said Singapore was more a" city "as a country," he explained why the elections in Singapore were so unequally important even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He seperated Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"as he said, Singapore" was not a land, "he obviously doesn't mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who makes a leader of a growing generation, such a polemical statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am talking about what is said to be the Minister of Justice of Singapore,..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that is another matter."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure whether he really believes it is correctly associated and aware of what he defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review presents the weaknesses of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Has Mr. Shanmugam "wellbeliever an error" or was it a Freudian speakers?</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only viewed as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, what land go back to the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as he plays an important role within the government, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of grave importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do they afford their military service, defend it only their city but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who has to pay back to our prime minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink staff?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the magazine Journey of a Decade to Beyahung, Singapore is and has always been a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I have not told what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This set seems to have annoyed many of the soul...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a town.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements such as" the defense of the country above all "" etc., but that is not quite true. "</seg>

<seg id="1898">"across the way of migrants, across Europe or Latin America, some places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, he is located on the border with Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is headed by a 59- year-old Mexikanerin with a small woman with a coral-pink brich and goldcolored earrings in teddy bears.</seg>
<seg id="1902">"she is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez, and grew up in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a goal for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2.50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with stole, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the room there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - but there are hundreds of African and haitician migrants here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs RamÃ­rez, the people are coming to full buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on cartons."</seg>
<seg id="1912">It does not want anyone to decline.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy them medications that they can't pay, they mashed them with a balsam the exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived in a short time."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable nickname for Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">"Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a stache beard), with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez."</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Brack.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," "he answers with a smile." I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women. "</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"you have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make use of normal a first stop in South America and then go north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other guardians from Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a famous name on the track, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"he tells that the Haitians and the Africans are often travelling together, and that Africans speak already at Whatsapp of Mrs. RamÃ­rez."</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companion, Michelet has lived in Brazil in advance and worked as building workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Football Championship."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his trip to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Titian.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our Mother and we never leave them again," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells that their guests are often sending messages messages when they have continued to grate her or to report her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explained that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she does not know much about Africa, but their guests have brought her to cook the chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. RamÃ­rez may be very well known, but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants travelling through Tapesula."</seg>

<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are too expensive too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he started to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar per night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"Valenzuela, that he knows what the guests are doing."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," says he. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border to the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived three years, he was transferred to the United States after a raid on his work place."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their houses for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he fled in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to squeeze money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and a unknown, an allotted, has offered him its roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"some months later, the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses the travellers consult quiet their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy that their house is full, but it is also nostalgically, because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother demares her in her album with many photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair stained, who made her a Kundalini, some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more, boy and old."</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check-Point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users?</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the residents of Xinjiang, a ethnic minority region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on 10 July, the mobile user in the Tianshan district of the city Urumqi received a cell notification in which it points the District government to install a surveillance app named Jingwang (or" "Web cleaning"). "</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the communication, it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But kÃ²ries the authorities use the app for more than fighting terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report on Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested by Kazakh in the autonomous prefecture, because they had installed the app, exchanged messages with a private Wechat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in the communication of the police state that the app would determine the sources and distribution paths of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, images, books and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is the blockage of pornographic web pages, from online fraud, Trojaners and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and to control their own home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" "remote" "state actors or even hackers could be able to manipulate the home network of a person or steal it."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to take control of digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while the messages about digital censorship in China tend to focus on the experience of users in major cities in the east and south, reality is very often dark for those who live in distant, ethnic ethnic minorities such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit disturbances and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme Censored and surveillance measures as well as routinous Internet depreciation."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the media-based media outlet" Images from Mainland China "(Optic converter), published news from a Checkpoint, presented photos from a checkpoint, at the police officers tapping the people indiscriminate if they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">"they have forced people to use tools, which are intended for older people."</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest of the rest technology.</seg>

<seg id="1984">"images from Mainland China" (Opinized column), also published a Jingwang-product description, from which the software can uplift the password requirement of a Windows operating system and therefore get full access to the computer's hard disk. "</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computer and mobile phones in Xinjiang to electronic handles."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang are possibly a response to the instructions of the City of Party Council to minimize the distribution of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and institutions related institutions including universities and research institutions are obligated to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office on the operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>

<seg id="2065">Its command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"he calls the loving" "confession". ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the cloaks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner shiver to your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot hold your cry out."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my cry did not fell enough, why she recompacted the pipe through a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"at my first time I asked myself whether the investigators had worked as a trash collection, or if it belonged to normal work equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had four cable intertwined to present us the, from their point of view, great invention of an enormous cable."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"within a single hour, three of them are changing, while I was still on the line."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice, which I heard."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the executioner noted the cooling, and found no favour at all, which is why he attacked an electric upstream."</seg>
<seg id="2076">Flow through my whole body enough to store my entire neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"my semi-nude body, which was spread on the ground, was the perfect electric ladder."</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was back.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been so around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">"I decided to sleep again, saying, let's say that was my only option."</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours left that came to me as minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the dawn fills the room" "Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answered with the voice of a exhausted young people:" "my Lord, my father needs to be fearful."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and beweg you, you will be moved."</seg>

<seg id="2090">"the Russian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time in the inside; sometimes he mutilted to his canvas, to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine inhaled lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives on the top floor of his family house, which had been part of them since 1967; the year, in which Israel had fulfilled his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family had to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as rocky (e.g.: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years, Hdaib has been an impassioned activist who represents the conservative majority and questioned their altproven opinions about gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression by art and rapmusic."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, but he also calls for the core of the whole Arab world. all these issues are not only rich in its hometown Amman Relevanz, but also in cities that reach Damascus to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted to his mind, and he can feel loud with people who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not openly give it openly, he triumphs against US American foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib regards his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war-areas, to do something with his identity as" Palestinian people "to do so, even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I am not thinking about my own life circumstances," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a man, "while he shaking a cafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; at this time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The law of law also states that public consumption is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a sensing hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the sms warm coffee and the Schwaders of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when one casts a look into the neighboring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore it's easy to do basic things - as to drink in the public during Ramadan Water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled an appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some of the parliamentarians who support the Islamic Action Plan - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexuals of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontspeers Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional norms of the country contradicts and the main reason for the concert."</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press conference in the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was "straight" due to the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also affirms that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is to be more dangerous activism that questioned the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila the people of human rights as a" progressive supporter of human rights "committed themselves to an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement may not be simply not easy to reach rhetoric, but in fact reflect a clear crystalline reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaibs work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib traditional gender standards to be Leibe by having made his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of a clearly low-known woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">In Jordan the number of 'Honmortar' has increased in Jordan - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of Honmorants reached its peak in 2016; however, the institutional infrastructure is still lacking in order to aid the women who tried victims of domestic or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the threat of domestic violence," and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee by the family that the woman has nothing to happen. "</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs Music enjoys great popularity and is known for it, even though not to shy back on topics, in his country long as tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib will dispute that his work is politically, however, however, that he is his music, the full explicit attack on sexuality, freedom and expression is not from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"for me was a question of politics," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lavla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated many times:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, on which one can get in his words," which one wants "- be it faith or failure, heterogeneity, or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + -individuals were highly censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular part of the popular program Roya to realize that his comments were torn down from the context and had been censored by his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a revised version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib buys the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals do not speak to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, which has remained in memory today thanks to its homoerotic poetry."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks for himself: if Abu Nuwhat, who was later to work on behalf of the potassium, could be open in the eighth century openly about homosexuality, why can Jordanier this not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Hashemite Kingdom, there is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the jordanic news service took several former members of government members and members of the teacher, with the reason they had expressed opposition to the problems that deeply rooted in the country deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the concert Hdaibs believes that only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanier."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is a constant Give and Take. Jordan, Mashrou'Leila now has a show for the second time, but the way of progress - it is Hdaib - consists of slow, printed and internal changes. it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the jordanic society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"finally, dreaming Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreams not only dreams of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is going through music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not through bombs, Streetunitions and on artificial way of guided democracies. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until that time, Hdaib will continue and therefore can afford resistance."</seg>

<seg id="2152">"it is thought that there is a variant of the Tanabata festival that is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohocus. another theory means that the strongholds, the drum and dancing over more than one thousand years were handed down to the Northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees."</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love-letters on guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Usage with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the revised version of the contribution" "love message on guerrilla fighters" "which has released the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here in the framework of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people that we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not much more important, people who feel alienated, affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question was precisely the two young Colombian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga by the Foundation Bogota and Cristian Palacios of the Young-Youth Foundation not more out of the head and inspired her to the campaign Cartas por la RepublicliaciÃ³n (letters for Reconciliation) which would encourage young people to write guerrilla letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"recently, her country was at the heart of a historic event, and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiation, the Colombian government had closed a peace treaty with the guerrilla war FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces columbiens), which forms the Schluspoint of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"international was the signating of the peace treaty, as significant that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos for his merits for the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, in front of the Colombian, there is still a long way to get to speak of real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrical fighters who have lived for many years in illegal bearings, have been exposed to a war rhetoric and carried out their arms around the clock, now have to integrate themselves into the living as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society again, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases profound hatred against guerrilla fighters, must record them into their ranks and support them in setting up a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">"Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columbians have to join together, and to help the integration process."</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and that is exactly what they did, until now, thousands of young people wrote letters - love message on former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">The target of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla warfare that can then be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters to reconciliation was created at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize winner who took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"that explained that we love the people we love to write on Valentine's Day thousands of love letters, but those forgot that they need much more necessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plane, he told, he continued to share his love with people this year that were most urgent."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"so the plan came to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of FARC, who now need to find their place in society and to build up a new life." the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to say discourse from a war history to a common history of peace. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now more than 2000 letters have been collected in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major towns of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquitilla and BogotÃ¡."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I have never thought that someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogota traveled to the camp to convey the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC presented themselves as they did before to counter the precepts of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no orders, but letters full of shelter from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very mobile moment for all involved." it is incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between "," told the policy-student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a representative of the Governors of the Province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience so: "</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had passed the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" "Cambook" "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla army had seen), I saw a guerrilla fighters who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down because alongside him on the bed was a MGL-pomeject, a deadly weapon in the bush."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and I said to him nevertheless," "hello, what do they do?" "he answered," "I answered a letter that someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life has someone written something so nice, so I responded to it." then suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks. "</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely and put me next to the pomegrower.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was the war, sorry, all the years of the faithful companion of this fighters were to be, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life than war. to join the FARC, the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the Hungertod." I have never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes. "</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"to the start, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC already conquered.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC explained the history of the organization, its ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" many years we have experienced how the social injustice of the state on the whole Colombian people worked out. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to shaping the society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"to achieve this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"these people have never been heard and had no right choice, and to realize that people that I often have seen as monsters and even hate, even people with beautiful feelings, who were reversed by their living circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the country lives, does me hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all people - even those who have killed and so much damage, we can teach us and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the Archbishop of the City of Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The columbianists was prophesy that after disarmament peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as it exist inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to rise up to the weapons and to protest for their rights. and that is completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we from FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call upon all defenders of peace - regardless of which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence, will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">In the last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some remote relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that all that was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they made absurd demands: some said to me, I had to prove it, I wanted to enter the official TV in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex, that everything was only bad, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have a body size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older men spoke even my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," They have brought a monster to the world not only your family, but the whole Republic has damaged. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she placed a strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors got and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"at the time, I had to switch to the apartment several times a day."</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later was placed under the window a car with blacked window discs and a numerical sign with a 95 dron.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after the third time had happened, I realized that something was lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human-riler friends check out the number of people - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you flying?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons I would not want to award their names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help I left the country, but then something terrible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without having to register without having to know, without everything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card in my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you don't think about, you warmer in security, just because you have left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">"our people know already, in which hotel you steckel. you even know your room number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still contact your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we do not talk about the gender equality, which is a table theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional kautics elements I still wear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, this psychological barrier can not be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I actually give me trouble the person who looks out of her past - that is, to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who are dorsal?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I have submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the first time I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked with someone who has sent a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he closed a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"for this I mean, they probably invite the relatives to take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end ask a proof that the so called" honour "has experienced by blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are also now gay men in these infiltrations?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says it would not be very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then above all those who have no rich relatives or have been dropped by their relatives by Kadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they will be held there so that they can present them later than terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "should they be brought in, they will show their bodies on television and claim they would have attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply gone, but specifically settled in order to radicalise itself."</seg>
<seg id="2336">"OC Media: is this now just a mutation, or do you have a source for this information?"</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was incarcerated one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people disappeared in this prison after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new of them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They have just taken them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so called Lord, that person was with me, when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"so far, however, they were not presented as a bandits, but there were still no reports before. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if this persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, already in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always played my hair for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I believe, already before 2003 I was familiar to the whole of Grosny, when I lived there - and I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was considered, I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to bring us back to the" "Civil Liberation" ", but eventually back to the stone-time."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were spotted; I had colored eyelashes, bore tube jeans and short tops. "</seg>
<seg id="2354">The safety Ministry of Sharia has never even scratched me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny, there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew it; they knew why men, young people there met."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a phrase: Kharda ma Kharda. that is said: "Spotte is not over the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say it to children if they make themselves funny over the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so simply put her eyes closed before you, because they believed you are sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they have never been offended, never hunted and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace time stopped?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began speaking on television about morals."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not speak about us, but above the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who had smiled and laughed up, saw you at one time with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the Republic constantly disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the U.S. are not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicates with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organise teacup, coexistence, I begining it to the hospital and help them get Essenskate."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no cents for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered these people myself as I dive in refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is Algerian.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so is nature, that has nothing to do with religion at all."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Tschetschenen, who want to make you prophesy in front of the mouth, that there is no gays by them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have what the cabs have, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet there are they - but" not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear."</seg>
<seg id="2387">So many men come from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fasten during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think about transitions of men that love men, and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a Trugator."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation, to be exact, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Don't know if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I will be so personally here but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know that I am myself.</seg>

<seg id="2411">"the region where most of the people living in Iran live in the Arab Ahwazi community has been shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it hard to deny the native Arab population to deny their living."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took over power and took great efforts to stop ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region there are some of the largest in Iran-coming oil and gas fields as well as some of the most powerful and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>

<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. taken by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the AfrofÃ©minas website. the article was subject to several discussions, in which many different positions were expressed."</seg>
<seg id="2436">They can be read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"if I say that I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">"they even place well-thought scientific and social arguments against me, why I should be feminist, and why in general, all feminist * should be inside."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, that women still earn less money despite the same education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes about what they should do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later come into a smooth ceiling, and that discrimination based on gender is still through the many different countries and crews."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of it and I am double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet, when I speak on skin colour, on racism, on black CIS women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora, when I mention how we always have physically, psychological and verbal abuse, both in and outside the feminist movement, decide to mention many white feminists and white intersectional feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, all agree that women - all women - should come together to" "raise their voices and" "Kumbaya, my Lord" to sing "to achieve equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk about it, that in addition to sexualised violence there is an institutionalized form of racist violence that we have black women exposed to two times."</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or about that black women and women of other ethnicities, as well as places of origin, make less money than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls are often referred to school more often than white girls because of obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black sphere and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand I want to have all women, all the men and all the people of any skin color; on the other hand, I can not join a movement in whose centre the white woman, which refuse to consider injustices in their mind that relate to both the gender and the skin colour of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented spheres that always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"dear 1851 in her speech:" "I am not a woman?" "and I also weighed myself to maintain an ideology in which the black woman in a historic sense is a dehumanly and marginalised nature."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I weighed myself to close groupings, which also absorbs our customs and customs to advance their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to draw white women the importance of overlapping of skin colour and gender. for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to instruct them for the better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women of different home income and to borders themselves from white feminism, there is still the word" feminism "in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I draw it before, release me full of feminism and to join the movement of Womanism, which is called stubborn for my dark skin and my status as a woman, that is so persistent that intersectional is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"it is now more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres, which are created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weem, the writer in the book Africana womanism: reclaiming (about: Africa-Womanismus: as we can defend ourselves) that we can defend ourselves in this way also, in which they are completely secure and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered that make the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion after they read these lines, please ask you to inform themselves about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement of which the black woman is concerned."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can uplift black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as a woman because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman part of this paradigm.</seg>

<seg id="2487">"if women do not even refund at all, they generally receive no support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also dependent on the men who are miserable. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence, in general, in law-law enforcement authorities."</seg>

<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women spoke that they were physically misused, 55% of women spoke of psychic abuse."</seg>

<seg id="2498">"every woman, which is refunded because of physical abuse ad, come two women who do not do this," stated at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"because women's suicide in Paraguay is not an own criminal offence, law enforcement authorities cannot be appropriately documented how many women can be murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>

<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, they wrote posts on Facebook, in which they described its insults and various attacks throughout their two-year relationship and told how he insulated them."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people answered their posts, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically, whether he ever raised the hand against them, and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of failure."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen by Carlos so long and did not leave him earlier.</seg>

<seg id="2628">"this entry by Rachel Cernansky originally appeared on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the United States since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outimmemorial, the first plant grown by NASA astronomauts in space and consumed."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for nearly 20 years, Morton's work became only through its own ingenuity and the question how many salads can get, borders."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noted that more and more salads have been patented and that he could not use them further."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents devided not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resiliency to diseases, a special red or green or bent leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more such patents have been registered in more and more plants like grain or cartels. due to these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts have been committed to food safety in order to ensure the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia of ancient tradition, Morton is still salad, it takes no longer time because his work is getting more and more difficult due to getting more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, as if in a river there is a rocky brows to which I have to paddling."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do this now, but it is a break with the breeding-tradition," "he says." "I think these patents go far at salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and when they withstand judgment, no one can breed any more a new salad, because all the features are already patented. so doing so good as possible and try to breed the characteristics that he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and strives to use no material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"he has also connected with a movement that is getting bigger in the US and anywhere in the world: open source Breeding (" "Open Source" ")."</seg>
<seg id="2641">"astronauts of the International Spines ISS have bred red tubes in the" greenhouse "of greenhouse. the station is bred and eaten. there, there will be tested whether plants in space can be cultivated."</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">"it is not a coincidence that this name is rather like that, when the movement came from the IT area, and not from the area of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for" Open Source "-seed) can be inspired by the movement for free" Open Source "software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was brought into life to ensure that some plant types and gens are not protected as intellectual property, and thus usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, just called Ossi, U.S. breeder can also pledge that others may use the seed of seeds from them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed, and sell it." "open source" "breeders only allow others to breed their seeds, to breed such as own varieties, and it does not immediately send - two aspects that are banned by many plant patents or prescribed."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seeds have joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-Board members, Jack Kloppenburg are control of seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to him, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by increasing seeds with natural resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2652">"Kloppenburg emphasises that the" "Open Source" "movement did not work with genetically modified plants."</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, Korean, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." "to buy our goal of ecological sustainability, the most recent examples could be bought in the global agricultural industry, such as the recent examples the merging of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto, and Bayer, should also know that the way it is cultivated in markets, such as these vegetables is bred."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"nutrition sovereign without seed-sovereign is not possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed initiative are committed to providing others to their seeds, and to patent their course in contrast, seeds and plant-characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered because the available Genpool is due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always restricted, incessant pumping."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, Executive director of Ossi, employed in their doctoral work with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it found out that about a third of all cartels as intellectual property is protected, thus making it usable for plant breeders either at all or only."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"there are such estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby suggest that mass-grown plants as wheat in an even larger style are patented as salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants become so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from those, through which their taste or colour improves up to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments, and threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties show that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to increasingly more patents. however, genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changing conditions are much worse due to climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto interacting in Carly Scaduto that genetic variety is generally important and also decisive for Monsantos activities. with a total of four pleasures and the cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the United States, the company is set up for the preservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that intellectual property is restricts to other breeder because" patents and the protection of plant varietal innovations promote "." a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow once the patent is expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions can help others to come with another method of the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovations not, but supports them by giving the public more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton looks different: 20 years of waiting for a patent, it certainly does not make innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you need to wait for such a long time to breed plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, the struggle would have already been lost."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetular incentives are not appealing to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what motivates us and it will be impossible if we continue to use the best and newest genetic resources.</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in all, Morton interferes with the concept in itself, plant-characteristics:" we do not really create the features ourselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol landpe, plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and Ossi-board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" those who grow a variety also grow its own values into it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with big farms and monokultures, which are needed for their cultivation mass-wise herbicides, will be breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is accurate. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that are moving on international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto are patents), they create the most smaller seed companies, even without patents, either reject the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton is looking for in his breeding garden salads.</seg>

<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeders from the Avoid of plant patenting innovative would:" it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies, the patent. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need to constantly have new material for my catalogue, since I know my competitors being sold my varieties in a couple of years ago," "he says." with a patent you are protected for 20 years ahead of competition with which you think it's quite nice to do. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"while the US seem to be leaders in the" "Open Source" "breeding, but the concept is spreading rapidly around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India the Center for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources, describes a" open source "seed program." to preserve the seeds of traditional farm crops, the center with farmers is working together and helps them meet new varieties that meet specific requirements. "</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seed and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German Organization in col works on an" "Open Source" "license that is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Ossi-Commitment for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding differ from country to country where the Ossi obligation cannot simply become one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive powers of the European Union, the European Commission, explains that conventionally re-bred plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European patent office which patents on conventional crops."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is at the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on open source" seed systems in Ethiopia, to farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives from all East Africa to learn something about the "" Open Source "" movement and the worldwide trend to patenting seed.

<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a group of aid organizations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - a report published. in this, it represents the possibility that farmers have the opportunity to improve seeds, to exchange and improve seed policy so that it can ensure stable supply of food."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection from the Luby of Ossi hopes that soon more people will be recognized."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has especially respected where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role in doing so, so Luby." we are trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their foods. "</seg>

<seg id="2725">"in spite of this attack and the adoption of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities, whom the law should be defending, to overcome speech and human rights in the Arab world, so it has never been so important as now. ANHRI have never been so difficult as now. ANHRI have never been so difficult to overcome these goals in order to overcome the blockage and not to prove it. we insists to fulfil our task further."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered to be the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities block the independent news page MADA Masr, Arabic-speaking issue of the Huffington Post and the funded network of Al Jazeera because of alleged" support of terrorism "."

<seg id="2729">"Ziada used his blog for spreading columnists and articles, which he writes not accessible websites and media in Egypt."</seg>

<seg id="2731">"bloggers, who is home to the name of Ziadas blog, on the other hand is more accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photo journalist, has spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video like police violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article mainly revolve around politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed himself to the block through the government and reflective what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"the blogs to lock is very old, however, has been priority in the era of Abdelfatally al-Sisi; and even if the block of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is however for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has been able to convey to me the feeling of a siege condition; one arrest, a attempted murder, overloading at the national Security Council, the blockage blogs as well as any other web site for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only on a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to post articles in order to avoid the censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"but now, after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>

<seg id="2746">"such practice points to the intention of the government to block and filter content, to access the Egyptian users."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation will additionally be worse that the censored decisions have been made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis, with which it can proceed against these actions."</seg>

<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and their partners."</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many districts of cities in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires that are rampant in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">"forty-two people died, and approximately 70 were injured due to the forest fires of 15 and 16. this led to the government last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days."</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region where there were 4 dead.</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 firebreaks, spread out in the northern and centrally located regions of the country and reached around 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June occurred in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande a similar tragedy, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forestry system, which monitors the forest-surfaces per satellite recordings, alone in Portugal alone about 500,000 hectares of forest burned - an area of the size of the district Lisbon."</seg>

<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: they used the own civilian protection data with the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires.</seg>
