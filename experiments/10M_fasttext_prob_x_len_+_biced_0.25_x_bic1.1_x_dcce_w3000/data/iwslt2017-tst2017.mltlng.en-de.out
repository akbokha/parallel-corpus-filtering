this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New @-@ York Times .
&quot; long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he spectac@@ ularly released , that the NSA heard illegal teleph@@ ones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence surgery , where the CIA placed on Iran literally for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if it sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
&quot; but do you know , if the chapter did not fall at all ? &quot;
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government against R@@ isen has established and prompted him to call for its alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became the symbol of the pattern of the government , wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers to condemn and journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to First Constitutional Court , the media has the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to use this law if media does not get this information , and if the identity of the mu@@ te can not protect it . &quot;
&quot; so when the government headed down at R@@ isen , he did something that many courageous porters already did before him , he refused , and said that he would rather go into prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk of going to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , something exceptional . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , even though they were for years of information that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in time of electronic monitoring the re@@ porters can always hide themselves less .
&quot; rather than to fail and bring r@@ isen statements , that could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , his telephone calls are secret , &quot;
&quot; just as his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit card , and even travel @-@ wise with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA w@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and ris@@ ens source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government has too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
since September 11 almost every article on national security has been the result of a wh@@ istle to a journalist .
&quot; so we put the press work , which should be protected by the first constitu@@ tionally , because the government has more options to choose all of them . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they are able to contact them from the moment in which they contact , rather than in retrosp@@ ect , in the witness . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software , which has not yet been written as r@@ isen , and it is much safer than regular e @-@ mails or telephone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source transfer system for W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , which was originally developed by the internet @-@ famous , which we have been developed by us and today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post office . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send documents , just like every ordinary contact form . &quot;
&quot; these will be encrypted and stored on a server , for which only the relevant news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government can no longer provide information to secretly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
&quot; Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is however only a small part of the whole , to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are constantly developing new mir@@ r@@ age@@ technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se us all . &quot;
&quot; it is to make sure that not only technology , such as Edward Snow@@ den have a way to express mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; who wants to report about abuse in the supply of soldiers modest and crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm to contaminated water from F@@ lin@@ t suggests . or a Wall@@ street In@@ sider , who warned us ahead of the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only committed to those who want to cover crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&quot; &#91; on 3 April 2016 the biggest data le@@ ak of history has been published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; &quot; reveal that Rei@@ che and mo@@ ist &#93; have hidden in tax hav@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we called Robert Pal@@ mer from Global W@@ ad@@ um to have an explanation . &#93; this week we were resident of news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the Mos@@ r Fon@@ se@@ ca in Panama . &quot;
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers at companies such as Mos@@ r Fon@@ se@@ ca go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , exchange of messages , how the whole system works , how it works . &quot;
this has already led to very first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
&quot; also , there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad has been in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin , over a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cello . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous to wait for the next publication , and the next uncovered documents . &quot;
&quot; now , this sounds like the P@@ lot of a record label or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham , novel . &quot;
&quot; it seems crying out of you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we address this ?
&quot; but the truth is : when the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not all its taxes pay , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this affects us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global W@@ hen@@ ish , these revelations are phenomenal . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world , media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax hav@@ ens are used by a few of them to hide and conce@@ al their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing it for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people this whole world appears very confusing , and it is hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine like a mat@@ jo@@ sch@@ ger scene .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters . &quot;
I find it interesting that in the US there are fewer reports of this matter .
&quot; probably , because there were no prominent Americans that occurred in these revelations , this scandal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but by principle , after which these tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ r Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data le@@ ak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some US States you need less information to provide less information to found a company , as to get a libr@@ arian proof . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparent in the US has allowed employees from school @-@ quarters to rip school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip especially acute investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global W@@ ER we wanted to find out how all this is in practice .
how does that work ?
&quot; so , we sent an covered investigation into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan . &quot;
&quot; our investig@@ ator gave himself as African ministers , who wanted to bring the suspi@@ cion money into the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really shocked that all of us have made suggestions on an attorney of our investig@@ ators , how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all accus@@ ations . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course nobody was given to the money . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as individual incidents .
&quot; it is not about a single lawyer , which spreads to our covered investig@@ ator proposals . &quot;
&quot; it is not about a single leader , involved in a scandal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior complic@@ ate .
&quot; this might sound very dull , as if we could do nothing about it ; as if nothing ever had changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful ones . &quot;
&quot; but when borrowed optim@@ ist , I certainly see that some has started to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , we have looked at more transparency for what the owners of companies . &quot;
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU is in central reg@@ isters at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliament@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how this Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , being used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global W@@ hen@@ ish this is a moment for change .
&quot; we need ordinary people , who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ firms . &quot;
&quot; we need executives in the economy , who get up and say , &quot; In@@ cre@@ ence is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it , through laws that end this kind of transparency . &quot;
&quot; together we can end the in@@ transpar@@ ence , which now enables this kind of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I were almost kidn@@ apped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das would be landed . &quot;
&quot; one day after I completed my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale . &quot;
&quot; one type in the red ma@@ ma@@ da remained , and looked at my stuff . &quot;
he bought one of my works of art .
&quot; he was alone in the city , and just made a road trip through the whole country . after that , he would go to the peace cor@@ ps . &quot;
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where are you asleep at night ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; I do not know . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just met him only ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans this . I don &apos;t want to land up in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard about : &quot; I have a air conditioner . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; Are , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was then in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh dear ! what did I get there ? &quot;
a game of living in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I rose out of bed , shut down on toe @-@ pointed , and my sleeping room door closed . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
the artwork that he had bought from me is today in his classroom . he is now teachers .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my view .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as a stranger , actually friends , who only waited to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; people on my air conditioner to sleep , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost bank@@ note , my room@@ mate moves out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I believe , creativity can make it easy to transform fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have over@@ laid out how we could make something about it . our apartment will stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air@@ bed and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars at the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it great and we too .
&quot; I am sure our cheese @-@ ham O@@ mel@@ et@@ ts tasted completely different , because we did them for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we took our last guest , and the door fell into the castle , flo@@ ated Brian and I think . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came into roles .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out whether one could make a business concept .
&quot; we presented our Invest@@ ors : &quot; &quot; we want to create a website , on which people post public pictures from their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind room , whose doors you are closing when visiting . &quot;
over the internet they can then invite wild@@ ly people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
but they do not act .
&quot; no one who is still at sol@@ ace , would invest in a shop that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we as children all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you bes@@ ought to see things that one can eat well . we could be designed . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to design@@ ate objects , but now we wanted to create trust through design immense confidence between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design be able to do something ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
&quot; I would like to give you a ta@@ d , what degree trust we asp@@ ed . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your Com@@ for@@ tz@@ one .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your phone in hand .
now I like to unlock your mobile phone .
type your ent@@ ang@@ ed mobile phone your left seat .
&quot; this silent place of panic , which you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door the first time . &quot;
&quot; because the only thing is more personal than your mobile phone , is your home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can read not only your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the t@@ apping cell of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
&quot; so , most guests feel when they are staying elsewhere . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
only once so , who has actually Al Gor@@ es cell phone ? &quot;
could you announce on Twitter so that he would be the president of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
you now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we have changed a little detail on this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour would have imagined once with his name ; if he &apos;d told , where he comes , how his dog or his children will be called ? &quot;
&quot; imagine you would have 150 covers , all of them say , &quot; He can really very well deto@@ x cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you would have to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ designed feedback system strengthens the confidence decisive .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to aver@@ t negative assessments .
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both host and guest had delivered their jud@@ gements before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are about age and home . &quot;
&quot; a little surprising , we trust the people most , who are most similar . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social pre@@ disposition .
exciting is it when you add the call of a person -- in our case by app@@ rais@@ als .
&quot; if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation sti@@ cking com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can thus help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; moreover , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get there . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you are too little told , as for example &quot; &quot; hi ! &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; say too much , as for example : &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request will not be accepted rather . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; T@@ olle art@@ works in your apartment ! I do with my family holiday . &quot;
how can I create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give advice on what topics you should write .
&quot; our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help , to overcome our prejudices towards strangers . &quot;
&quot; with what we had not reck@@ oned , the large amount of people who were more than willing to aver@@ t these prejudices . &quot;
here you see how many people use our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
&quot; second , the tirel@@ ess work of our team . &quot;
&quot; third , a need that had not been covered before . &quot;
for us the business runs very well .
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have allowed un@@ allowed parties or apartments devast@@ ated .
hosts have left guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken .
there is nothing wrong as these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think of it .
&quot; the disappointment that one hear in the voice of the call@@ ers , was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the 123 million paid nights had only a fraction ever a problem . &quot;
for people trusted each other too right .
&quot; when confidence works , it is possible to create magnificent . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host went to hospital .
he even don@@ ate blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers , which tend to be due to sitting activities to heart attack . &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals .
&quot; Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real prot@@ ections to save life , even though they don &apos;t know anything really . &quot;
&quot; they drive one in their own car to hospital , if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they do not want you feel lonely , they bring books over . &quot;
they can even stay longer without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay will run . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure monetary policy are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled about this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions together ?
it is here about an economic trade .
&quot; but it is simply to call &quot; &quot; lease &quot; , &quot; the thing does not do justice . &quot;
&quot; Share Economy describes trade , human relationships promises . &quot;
&quot; people lay a part of himself open , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; when one travels nowadays , this is fast compared with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but for this less authentic . &quot;
&quot; what would be , however , when travelling a rich buffet of local impressions would be ? &quot;
&quot; what if at any place you have visited , there would be a group where Ans@@ wer would wait to fill a thoroughly and to show one at a pub that one has never heard ; &quot;
or if you could get cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays homes are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to share apartments from scratch ?
what would this look like ?
what if cities would take the thoughts of the common part ?
&quot; I imagine towns that allow ourselves to society and relationships , instead of lon@@ eliness and shut@@ off . &quot;
&quot; in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces included in the government , &quot;
residents are now offered . students who were looking for a lead .
&quot; were conve@@ yed to people whose children were educated . it was started , In@@ cub@@ ator programs were started , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . on our platform alone , night 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guests at a stranger or even host . &quot;
the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality has existed before .
there were similar websites to us .
so why has exactly ours work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ce .
I find it stun@@ n@@ ingly ;
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to pon@@ der every@@ time when a red ma@@ da is over to me .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think if you watch me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or sup@@ pressed , subjected to bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay at the safety check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I will not give you the fault for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
one study found that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not speak to their ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met a Muslims , It is great to meet you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee eli@@ ke -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ;
a Mö@@ ch@@ te@@ at @-@ Fitness @-@ fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ age
and I am a practicing . spiritual Mus@@ lim@@ in .
&quot; but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not so born . &quot;
I decided to make a decision .
when I was 17 years old I met the decision to ou@@ ten myself .
&quot; no , not as homo@@ sexual person as some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I chose the hi@@ j@@ ab to carry my head covering . &quot;
&quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied , &quot; Why oppressed you yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the L@@ ame was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , namely towards the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty . &quot;
I have not just accepted the faith of my parents .
I have taken up with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought , was in question , dou@@ bt@@ ful and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow surrender which deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to crying .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
this is how it feels like that .
&quot; later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as engineering . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian American dream . &quot; &quot;
then that horrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; E@@ il@@ message . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people sp@@ ying out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned fast into rebellion .
why should you do something like that ?
&quot; I switched to the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; not only my country had been attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds were related to others of a civil war in a suspi@@ cious circle . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start building up studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I cycl@@ ed -- when we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved this night to our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then heard that I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said , &quot; &quot; watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Ho@@ d war@@ y , &quot; &quot; lead in well illuminated areas , &quot; &quot; sam@@ pl@@ ating you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to prayer .
&quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people , who held for Muslims , war@@ ped and struck . &quot;
there was really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt not right .
&quot; because people who have attacked this country , have attacked our country . &quot;
I swe@@ pt the anger of people onto the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly declare itself constantly .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in that country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish and make mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it only raises the question : are we mali@@ cious or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor you can see as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor one only stops watching .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Er@@ sth@@ and and Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make sure ?
&quot; maybe there will be a couple of parking spaces free , but not stop the terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to people other faith tolerant , and to show greater citizen participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; the radic@@ alization process has been noted that it starts online . as the first one can cut off the person from their church , even by their family , that the person believes that the person is true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ rupt their behaviour and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or of faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we need to stop people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some will still claim Islam be a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS is founded their brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a person , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add to their imagination , if one recognizes them as representatives of 1,6 billion believers . &quot;
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u frac@@ ture with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology reasons on their &quot; sacred book . &quot;
&quot; but when one thro@@ ws a look at it , it doesn &apos;t drive them what they read in their &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m told me recently an amazing story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because she had imagined to join the IS . &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every spiritual , with whom she had spoken , she brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; nothing inspired and something that had given its anger sense , it was a main aim for the instrument@@ alisation through extremis@@ ts that gave her a solution . &quot;
this ima@@ m set the connection to God and her church again .
&quot; instead of accused her of her anger , he showed her constructive ways for real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , she kept to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight as the Islam@@ ophobia is concerned with me and my family .
but how does it affect regular Americans ?
how does it affect anyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affects our democracy every day on our freedom of thought ?
&quot; one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show , if we fear , pass at least three things . &quot;
&quot; we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , conformity and prejudices . &quot;
&quot; a study reveals : when you report testing messages , negative about Muslims , they voted rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the Rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not only a academic problem .
&quot; if you look when the mood against Muslims up upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two constitu@@ ents .
&quot; so , Islam@@ ophobia is not just the natural reaction of Muslim terror as I expected . &quot;
it can actually be a tool to manipulation the public in order to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
the handling of Muslims is an early warning .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear fills us all . &quot;
&quot; in the assignment of collective , it is not just about being able to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both of them went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ men .
&quot; he was at the dental faculty , talented , lots of promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me , that he was the sweet , generous man , whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when is out of my breasts , such a sealed young man ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne in her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an that was in the afternoon when he posted statements against Muslims on his fac@@ ebook @-@ site . &quot;
he was eighth eight times in De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we going to the mosque or were we safe at home ?
&quot; we bes@@ et it and for us it was not an easy decision , as it was about which America would leave us to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one where we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we chose the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove exhau@@ sting , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , drew my shoes out , went into prayer all , and what I saw , let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , printed and was welcomed our guests , because half of the gathered Christians were Christians , Jews , Buddh@@ ists , believers and non @-@ believers that were come to attack us , but to join us . &quot;
in that moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they have courage and compassion panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go to number sure ?
or will you connect to those that mean : we are better than that .
thank you .
thanks beautiful !
&quot; Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I ask myself what do you say that you might say that you are holding an TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker &apos;s dr@@ au@@ ght working in a noble thought factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say if you do not . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; looking at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
&quot; so , in no respect I am an exception . &quot;
&quot; if people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what started as a platform for cra@@ fting , is about to be a billi@@ on@@ aire . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . made possible in research facilities worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air package representation into our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of aircraft machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . a few years ago , they began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; through inter@@ locking , air devices reach high speed and acceleration in narro@@ west space . &quot;
you can also build up self @-@ constant structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry loads , to deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of possible space in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order to work a system autonom@@ ously , it needs to know collectively , where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
in our laboratory at ET@@ H Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on rapidly developing dynamic tasks .
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a offsprings of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board that should do the machine . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available at the highest level . for example , &quot; &quot; launch &quot; &quot; and &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter .
&quot; one airplane , which tries to beat two flies with a cap . &quot;
&quot; like other Star@@ r@@ ators , it is efficient in advance @-@ trip efficient , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float , and thus has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a downside . &quot;
a limitation of mer@@ cury is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ences such as wind turbines .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air device doesn &apos;t matter in which location the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often introduce fundamental abstract questions concerning the core of the matter . &quot;
one such question would be for example : what is the smallest number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons why we want to know the answer to such a question .
helicopter are known about as machines with a thousand moving parts that gather together to hurt you .
decades ago I could fly remote @-@ controlled air devices that only had two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ ru@@ der .
unfortunately we discovered that flies with only one works .
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically custom@@ ary tel@@ escope . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no cl@@ ap , hing@@ es and cross @-@ rests , no further posi@@ tional or controllers , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it &apos;s mechan@@ ically simple , happens in the inside life very much , that it can fly stable and can move over in space . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the loft . to get it to flying , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the probability , it &apos;s right to throw when all of me watch is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night . &quot;
&quot; when the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in enjoyment , this machine is here , the om@@ kop@@ ter with its eight pro@@ pane , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symm@@ etrical .
therefore it is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
&quot; by doing so , he receives the proper capacity , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter which direction he is rot@@ ated or even as it is rotating . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight pro@@ pane . &quot;
&quot; some is conceivable in models , the rest will get directly at flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see this on .
&quot; if flying machines must be part of our daily life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is made of two separate two @-@ prop@@ ellers .
these revol@@ ves in the clo@@ ck@@ wise direction
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when one builds them together they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
&quot; however , something wrong , a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly , albeit limited . &quot;
we will now demonstrate that we are making a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration was examined synthetic s@@ warming .
&quot; large number of autonomous , co @-@ ordin@@ ated units makes a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took the standard Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alizing technology and algorithms .
&quot; each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit . &quot;
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think of new revolutionary ideas .
the especially safe machine there I want to be a flying lamp at Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types of us the wage is in development and creation .
&quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures allowing them to form so spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
&quot; in a very far away Galaxy two black holes revol@@ ve each other ever faster , they turned so much the mass of three son@@ es in a tenth of energy in pure energy . &quot;
this short moment they sounded more bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy did not put it into form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was given into space period itself and the universe has explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
&quot; first , we arrange the events in the first time . &quot;
1.3 billion years ago there was a majority of life on earth .
&quot; since then , the earth has brought many things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , people and -- God stand with us -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- R@@ ai Weiss of MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech - a giant laser det@@ ector to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves that arise about colon@@ ised black holes . &quot;
most held them for crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
&quot; after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely much hard work they built the Det@@ ector LIG@@ O : the laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ om@@ dom@@ eter Observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following time , the precision of the LIG@@ O could be substantially increased , which improved the recognition performance . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is called Advanced LIG@@ O . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , LIG@@ O was started for a last test run to clear some minor , persistent issues . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ant black holes caused by the earth . &quot;
you went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the goodbye to my To@@ d@@ sick father .
basically they were the fruits of my life .
&quot; all this , for what I had worked , is no longer Science F@@ ic@@ tion ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theore@@ tic physic@@ ists on MIT . he has been studied gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes and their by observ@@ atories such as LIG@@ O measurable signals . &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a c@@ abling in the fabric of space and time .
&quot; when passing the wave , the space and its total content is stretched in one direction and into the other . &quot;
&quot; to illustrate , lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses for rel@@ ativity is often a really al@@ ber@@ ing dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and dust , stretching and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridiculous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each of us was stretched by us during the meeting of the waves and stretched out the stretch of an average human being was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is called 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by an 1 Dar@@ in , to explain the LIG@@ O staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometres long laser det@@ ector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be exactly measured to less than a thou@@ sand@@ al of the radius of a nuclear program . this is grot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about gravity
&quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder Lig@@ os that are hunting for the waves in the following manner : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physic@@ ists are resour@@ ce@@ ful , and with the support of the public , certainly all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to LIG@@ O . Scott maintains that LIG@@ O is more of a ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial excerpts , the size of your cell phone . &quot;
this is quite convenient . because in this way you can make an image or a map of things by perc@@ eiving the light of several points of light around you .
at tones it is different .
audi@@ ble notes have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean to you particularly much : &quot;
the face of your child approximately .
&quot; instead we listen to certain properties such as sound base and height , rhythm and volume , to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , just speak Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob under@@ breaks them . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot produce simple pictures from objects in space with them .
&quot; but by watching changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least lie for LIG@@ O the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
&quot; so when we convert shaft patterns in loop , we can hear the All literally . &quot;
&quot; the grav@@ itation to listen , can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes , thus my colleague Scott has been very busy for quite a long time . &quot;
&quot; S@@ H : two black , non @-@ speed holes , cir@@ pen simple : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turning the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same circle with an additional sound @-@ change . that sounds like Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ shape . &quot;
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- listened to LIG@@ O following : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des sound &#93; Yemen and , who knows what he must hear , recognize this as sound of -- S@@ H : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which turn around as fast as the rods of your mix@@ ers . &quot;
AA : think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , orbit each other one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we heard it .
therein lies the permanent importance of LIG@@ O .
LIG@@ O opens an entirely new way to exploring the universe as it was never before possible .
on this way we can listen to the All @-@ listen and the invisible .
much in space we can -- practically or basically -- not to see .
&quot; a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why to explo@@ ded stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . of them we have learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; the exciting physical processes occur however at the core , which lies behind thousands of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see through because these op@@ ak are .
&quot; the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron , as if it were transparent glass . the Big Bang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , because the ur@@ ch@@ ew is covered by its own after@@ glow . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible until the beginning back . &quot;
&quot; most importantly : I am optimistic that there exist in All things that we have never seen before , which we have never seen before , and of which we have no idea of what we just discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , LIG@@ O found right in the first attempt things that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague am MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the LIG@@ O project , says to this topic : Me : the kind of stars that bring black holes , like LIG@@ O they are observed , are the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of the universe . &quot;
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are of the sau@@ er@@ bones for our arche@@ ological work . &quot;
&quot; LIG@@ O enables us to look at all the events in all , to the emergence of the stars and finally on how we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now exists to be as courageous as possible .
&quot; thanks to LIG@@ O , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cus of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a brand new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than to listen to the urine ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; a year long I would say to all &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; , before which I feared . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it makes me nervous , me in unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
wanted to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
wanted to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
wanted to start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , but yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : just what to do , before I feared , there was my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , to keep speeches , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , gone . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life has changed . &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; I changed . &quot;
but there was a certain yes that changed my life on an unexpected . it started with a question of my youngest .
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for un@@ explained reasons all &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; valu@@ ing , I need milk for my beak @-@ up . &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; of a new way of life in my family . from there I swe@@ ar to play with them , as soon as you ask me to do it . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say Yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am trying very much . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , upon my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has a striking side effect : first of short , I actually understood that the &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; have saved my career with my children . &quot;
I have a real dre@@ am@@ job .
&quot; I am author@@ ess . I think things out , we@@ ther you to life . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I Cre@@ ire TV . I produce TV .
&quot; I make TV , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each program offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can lie between three and six million dollars .
say we say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days of four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , four episodes , 3 episodes : show To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series are running on Thurs@@ days .
&quot; all over the world , my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are shows that I have created myself , and not only produced , so still above . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to get my fans around the camp@@ fire and to tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire that burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who does that ?
&quot; nobody , that &apos;s why I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think , when the word &quot; &quot; author &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I tell you so that all of you who want to work so hard on whether you &apos;re talking about work , a country or a classroom , to take me seriously if I say about work , so you understand that I am not just around the computer , and imagin@@ ative , and it is true when I say , I understand that it is not just a dre@@ aming dream . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m working much , hard and I love it . &quot;
when I go into the work there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a land from nothing .
&quot; it is , when I put troops on , as I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as usual , you have a high tone , lying down a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and maternal , cruel and rational . and the best thing about it is the buzz . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working well .
&quot; a buzz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the buzz sounds like a busy road , I could always go on it forever . &quot;
&quot; many people take , when I declare to them the buzz that I am writing , writing my joy . &quot;
don &apos;t understand me wrong it does .
&quot; but the buzz - when I began working with television production , when I began to work and work , build up and working together , I discovered this thing , this buzz , this energy . the buzz ! &quot;
the sums are more than writing .
the sums of action is promotion and activity . the sums of money is a drug .
the buzz is music . the buzz is light and air .
the buzz is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a buzz , then you cannot take differently from the size . &quot;
&quot; feeling that can not be different than strive to size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the buzz .
or maybe it will also be a work@@ a@@ holic .
maybe it is called genius .
maybe it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I do not know .
&quot; I know only that I am not for failure , and I know only that I love the buzz . &quot;
&quot; I will only tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I will not ask it into question . &quot;
&quot; to make sure : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more surplus @-@ found boundaries , the more work , the more I watch history , the more I write history , all the more expectations there . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I need to work . &quot;
and what do I say about work ?
&quot; I love working , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the country , which I created , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz . &quot;
I like this buzz . I love the buzz .
I need the buzz . I am the buzz .
am I just this buzz ?
and then the buzz stops .
&quot; revised , over@@ taken , exagger@@ ated , burned down . &quot;
the sums stops .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom@@ my is a single worker .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my mom@@ my will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; ass@@ essors , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are baby @-@ tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the buzz hearing . &quot;
the buzz of the engine was mu@@ ddy .
I don &apos;t loved my work anymore . the engine was off .
the sums came not back .
my buzz was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours days , sculp@@ ted weekends , no repentance , nothing del@@ e@@ zing , a Titan sleeps , does not exist , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no tot@@ ality .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was an preview Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the buzz and the buzz I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; ha@@ y you out , flo@@ wer@@ der author Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do , you are doing , you love what you &apos;re doing is a banker , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love one another and that gives one the buzz , if you knew the buzz , when the sums stops , who is one then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; gave me a question .
&quot; I am on the way outside , late for it and she says , &quot; Mama , do you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I will say no , I will be aware of two things : &quot;
&quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she called me not . &quot;
it does not call anyone more &quot; valu@@ ing . &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; I hate when I am Titan I and my buzz , and here everything changes my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; Mama , Do you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; yes . &quot;
this is nothing special .
&quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read more dramatic from the book &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing exceptional .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ eliness and in the absence of summ@@ ing , I can do nothing but to match . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quietly .
&quot; the country , which I created , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , watch@@ dog and the song in which it is going to leave , or whatever the girl in &quot; &quot; The king@@ gin &quot; . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
play is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door passes on and an energy output comes in .
&quot; and not immediately , but it happens , it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums come back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , barely audi@@ ble but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a buzz . &quot;
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the buzz , the working environment , the titanium @-@ sum@@ ms , this is just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself through broad@@ casts and television lessons and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real buzz . &quot;
the sums of money is not a force and it is not specific .
it is dependent on the joy .
the real buzz depends on the love .
&quot; the buzz is the river , which comes from the pleasure of life . &quot;
real sums is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real tot@@ als are ignor@@ ing the pressure of the story , the tasks , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real sums is simple and original .
&quot; the real sums of God is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps I whis@@ pered God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan I ? &quot;
it is simply love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , a lot more love . &quot;
&quot; once my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ a@@ holic from any guilt . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice unless I want to hear the buzz . &quot;
&quot; I wish it was so easy . I am not good in games , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; do not play ans@@ at@@ ly , as we work . &quot;
the truth hur@@ ts ;
but I don &apos;t like it to play .
&quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I prefer working at the workplace as at home .
&quot; this entrance is painful , because what a man works rather than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I am . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan , &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we ras@@ hes around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play Ball .
we Zer@@ burst Sei@@ fen@@ bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel mainly sti@@ ff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always cut off after my mobile phone .
yet it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the buzz of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever stopped using the game ?
you can also tell it ! tell them always Yes when your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you hold me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day @-@ dre@@ amer . &quot;
you probably have right but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you also know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et @-@ Show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes for a maximum of 15 minutes , until they die that they want to do something different . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ et@@ le or kis@@ ses replaces me .
&quot; and speak my teenage daughter all 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more needs it not . &quot;
everyone can bring 15 minutes a piece even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes a piece !
&quot; no mobile , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
the day is short : dinner , the children un@@ ready . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my wellbeing , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is true to feel the buzz , a place for his soul peace . &quot;
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it is about joy ;
&quot; to play &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
allow yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and keep it out .
&quot; I am not perfect at it . I sh@@ eit@@ ers and I si@@ ege . friends meet , books read , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; if you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I got up , when I got my first TV show when I was playing a Titan in education than I wanted to exceed myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the piece why not every 15 minutes get enough ?
what can it be wrong ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the buzz seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
working does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens up and I find myself in my office . I hear a familiar melody , she meets me and my soul . she leads me to new ideas . I use it into full trains and love my work again . &quot;
&quot; I like the buzz , but I do not love it . &quot;
I do not need it .
I am not the buzz , the sums of money is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is now my buzz .
the buzz of life .
the sums of love .
&quot; the sums of work is part of me , but just a part . and for this I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; it is me schn@@ au@@ d@@ oll , that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and to more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my bon@@ fires still burn .
&quot; the more I play , the more happier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clear my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the buzz . the country , which I created , the marathon , whom I run , the can@@ v@@ ases , the s@@ can@@ v@@ ases , the buzz , the buzz , the other , the right sums , the buzz of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this buzz , the more this unusual , steady , naked and new feeling of life in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this buzz , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am author . I think things out , I we@@ ave it to life . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and to more games .
tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am neuro@@ surgical in .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very frustrating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe violation of the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , heavy disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I have functional neuro@@ surgical treatment .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions .
&quot; for sure , they have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; low @-@ stag @-@ stimulation . &quot; this im@@ planted a power of power in the brain to influence the neur@@ ons of neur@@ ons so that the neurological function improves . &quot;
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease that suffered under heavy tre@@ mor and severe pain .
&quot; however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the recovery of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
&quot; at the time , I was the leader of the doctor and worked in the emergency one day and night . &quot;
often I found patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they must imagine that in skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ mas the brain clim@@ bs and the skull @-@ inn@@ ru@@ ck clim@@ ates .
&quot; to save life , you have to dimin@@ ish the skull @-@ end@@ ru@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; to do this , one must sometimes remove a part of wollen bra@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; rather than throwing brain mass , we decided to analyse it with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; cells from a tissues to grow grow , is comparable with very small children that will be taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to thri@@ ve them . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it worked for Jean @-@ François .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you still know from the bi@@ ologi@@ an lessons that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into any cell type of organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain these kinds of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery .
we did a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they split up very quickly .
they never die ; they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells stopped different .
they slowly got off slowly and after a couple of weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but was different . &quot;
&quot; we needed long to understand , where they came . &quot;
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our grand@@ hir@@ n@@ rin@@ se cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; at the stage of the fet@@ us , they ensure the speed of the brain . &quot;
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injury . &quot;
but this is not so secure .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells .
we stand before a potential source of cell that enables brain @-@ healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to see a piece of brain from the non @-@ speaking area and then cultivate the cells to cultivate them as it did Jean @-@ François
and they afterwards mark color to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we rec@@ alled them at the recording of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ splan@@ tation - Aut@@ otran@@ smit@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we reproduce these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what is going to happen if we reproduce the same cells in temper@@ ate brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario , we rec@@ alled the cells in a healthy brain , and we watched that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared , they go back home . the room has already been occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we had an injury to and re@@ im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells are preserved -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been im@@ planted .
&quot; the evidence that they show are these small points . these are the cells we have in vit@@ ro , in the culture . &quot;
&quot; here , of course , we could not stop . &quot;
will these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain lesi@@ on ?
&quot; so , we trained monkeys with a manual &apos;s skill . &quot;
they had to take feed pel@@ lets from a tra@@ y .
they did very well .
&quot; when they had achieved a stable fate level , we injured the mot@@ echnology area in the motor@@ ised cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; ther@@ eu@@ pon , the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hands . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen with people , it recovered spontaneously to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to rec@@ u@@ perate with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they are a certain degree , just as with the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recreation , im@@ pl@@ anti@@ ed we had its own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left side they see the monkey , which recovered spontaneously . &quot;
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , when we re@@ im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the plantation . &quot;
I can tell you that were very exciting results for us too .
&quot; since that time , we have found very much more about these cells . &quot;
we can free@@ ze it and use later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example Par@@ kinson . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ itate them in people .
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself . &quot;
thank you .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that is wonderful , I &apos;m sure now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at people . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one has to fill about two kilograms papers and forms to go through this kind of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time to have a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and trying to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future as many years it will take until someone can get to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : it is difficult to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study . &quot;
will we allow the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to choose patients to perform the treatments , and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , you have to apply this to a multi @-@ centric study . &quot;
&quot; first , one has to really suggest that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone . &quot;
&quot; BG : and that it is certain , of course . J@@ B : natural . &quot;
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne thank you for your visit at TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality , but as invent@@ ories of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ changeable ge@@ aring .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great after@@ no@@ mer in Beijing have proven beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impres@@ sing growth , while politics remains completely non @-@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy comes up with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year when I re@@ presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- not likely to influence the austerity programmes that have been realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my Ascen@@ ded friends , who repeatedly told me that democracy would change if they would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you to believe in common with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group of an error , we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and defen@@ cel@@ ess democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies are painted , our future glo@@ omy , and our great , new technologies wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of extravag@@ ance , I would like to refer you to an interesting contradiction , which is currently under threat to our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; Twin Summit Par@@ adox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , which thro@@ ws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt mountain , &quot;
but few recognize his tin .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the high level of austerity and corporations , which , however , are too anxious , where it would be productive and income , with which you need to wear the debt recovery and also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months , 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars were invested in the US , in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , quiet , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds after much money , until one compar@@ es it to the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time in the same countries as well as our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock exchange and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit , which is not equal due to the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ old in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , which would not invest in which they do not invest . exactly like O@@ di@@ pus Father who would not invest in which they wouldn &apos;t invest . exactly like O@@ di@@ pus Father who would not invest in which they would kill him if he will grow , &quot;
un@@ rolled the circumstances leads to that Ö@@ di@@ pus is killing him .
this is my ha@@ sty with capitalism --
&quot; its extremely conce@@ al@@ ous capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents , and especially all the technologies to finance &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for saving the Earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue . but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
&quot; Ar@@ ist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the social form , in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian Democracy naturally closed too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be an error to min@@ ate the significance of the ath@@ ic democracy due to these exclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the judgment of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that she gave the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of speech , but more important and more decisive for them to give them the right to political co @-@ determination in questions of the state of state . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not long been held --
&quot; like a candle , which shines very bright , it is also rapidly burned out . &quot;
&quot; however , our current liberal democracies does not have their roots in the ancient Athens . &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for Herr@@ sch@@ ende . &quot;
&quot; for the liberal democracy only came up , as a complete separation of politics and business was possible and the democratic process was introduced to politics , while the economy -- the world of corporations - a democratic zone was established . &quot;
&quot; in our today &apos;s democracies has been taking place since the time of which this separation of politics and business began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two and the economy gradually sub@@ mits its policies to politics . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer as they did before ?
it is not part of a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is because you can still be in the government today and yet do not believe in power , because the power of politics is ab@@ out@@ ated and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my ha@@ sty with capitalism .
&quot; when you think about it , it is in about just like a flock of predat@@ ors , which has so sustain@@ ably the animals , from which they nour@@ ishes , dec@@ eived , that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy , which has become so far can@@ ni@@ zed by the self @-@ causing economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political goods grows , the overall economic demand falls and the general manager of the corporations are frightened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful of capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; &quot; dem@@ os &quot; &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the welfare of humanity . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that we have to bring politics and the economy back together , and it would be better if the &quot; &quot; demos &quot; &quot; hold control as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea by the way .
the Marxist left had this idea a hundred years ago and it wasn &apos;t very good .
the lesson from the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position like in the ancient Athens without creating new types of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is a solution : to save the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing Ni@@ ed@@ ri@@ bb@@ utz through automation and robots .
&quot; the problem with this is how long business and politics are separate , the automation summit will be higher , the extravag@@ ance and social conflicts are deeper , just as it &apos;s been very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we need to re@@ shape the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and thereby respect for the un@@ iting territory , otherwise we end up in a disease surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that will appear the film &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; like a documentation . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements that he brought forth to survive -- &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; &quot; matrix Tre@@ k &quot; , &quot; in which machines serve people and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; A@@ gora , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life . &quot;
&quot; I believe , we must be optimistic . &quot;
so what could it look like could it look to have this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; like utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from a job office to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is property of those who currently work in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all incomes come from capital and from income , and the concept of wage labour is completely outdated . &quot;
&quot; there is no distinction between those who belong to the companies , which are not working in it , and employees working there , but no more exchange between capital and labour , no major gaps between investment and austerity , and ultimately no sc@@ ented twin summit . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please note that our national currencies would have a free exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest threshold countries &#93; , in the interest of all mankind . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trading is acted in this currency -- we call it &quot; &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; - and each government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade union of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investments are scarce . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that it was not the technical means at that time .
&quot; today , in particular , we have in particular the background of a re@@ united politics and business . &quot;
&quot; the world that I describe you is at the same time liber@@ alisation , in which it privileged people prefer , and Marxist , because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ an@@ ese , global key@@ note . &quot;
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide to deal with politics .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better . &quot;
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and business is ... do not do it , technological development will produce such massive decline in economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mon is known as &quot; &quot; long term stagnation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we experience it currently , it will not only destabili@@ ze our democracies , but also the countries whose interests are low in liber@@ ally democracy . &quot;
&quot; when this analysis is correct , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; like Hay@@ ek , this is why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that is why I am also completely wir@@ h . &quot;
&quot; BG : indeed , and now we are at ease too . &quot;
Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ h you don &apos;t think enough .
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you have said very clearly what you think from the West &apos;s view to China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracies we have the semb@@ lance of Democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy on policy , while the area where most of the economy takes place -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain way , when I can say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; because -- remember -- we tend to re@@ connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , historically considered . &quot;
liber@@ alism and Liber@@ al as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly skep@@ tical of what the democratic development concerns .
&quot; what can be observed in China is similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many list@@ eners were curious about your experience as the finance minister of Greece in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I ah@@ ned that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal standpoint , and very disappointing , because we had the opportunity to start with the Eurozone a new beginning , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely to adopt ourselves from self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the continuous denial which ran into a massive reduction line through the euro zone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way , the first suggestion was that this denial was revealed -- &quot;
&quot; it is correct to do . unfortunately , the powers inside the Eurozone , within the European group , continues to deny the denial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one is trying to get an economic system that is not viable , by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , it may be hesit@@ ant for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes are you looking ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- seriousness ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister or a minister who claims after 6 months in office , especially in such a tense situation , he claimed no mistakes , then that is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
&quot; I believed that there was an honest interest on the pages of the don@@ or , to find a common solution . &quot;
but that was not .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government to fall , just because they did not want to deal with the con@@ vul@@ sions caused by the eurozone . &quot;
they did not want to confess that they have been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nom@@ inate GDP .
&quot; there is worse than during the &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of the Troika &apos;s tro@@ ika who has imposed us this policy : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal error . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of talks , you seem to be still quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from someone who lives and love Europe . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; my greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive . &quot;
&quot; for if they did not survive , the shared fli@@ ers will be demon@@ ised and the European Union will destroy . &quot;
&quot; this will not be disastrous for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to strike the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what appears to me , it will be as well toler@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong in this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for you were at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; by Roy Price , most of which have never heard before , although he probably is responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago .
Roy Price is a representative of Amazon Studios
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ ger and describes it on Twitter as &quot; Films , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for making the shows and the contents to reproduce the Amazon . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very tough industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any one .
&quot; he must find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are at the right side of this turn . &quot;
this curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ D@@ b website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review get .
&quot; if your show is evaluated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad &quot; , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ one , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , the addic@@ tive ones , where , after you looked a season , your brain asks , &quot; Where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ ler and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- that should tell you what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price doesn &apos;t care about to get onto the left side of the curve , because I think it needs special intelligence to sub@@ ordinate &quot; To@@ dd@@ ler and Ti@@ aras &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the mean explo@@ iters , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they are simply not thrilled . &quot;
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes it something , so Roy Price wants nothing to risk . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he has guaranteed success , so he will hold a competition . &quot;
&quot; it takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where everyone can view them free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon exist out in vain things , one does not attack properly ? &quot;
millions of viewers have a look at these episodes .
&quot; however , they don &apos;t know that they will be observed when watching this shows . &quot;
they are observed by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
&quot; you can capture when you start the Show , when you pause , which parts you can skip and again . &quot;
collect millions of data to determine which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , collect the data , process these and it results in response , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
you made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; Alpha House , &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of these curve 7.@@ 4 is and Alpha House lands at 7,5 -- that is something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time at another company , another manager has placed a top show by Data Analysis . its name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of organizing a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data on Net@@ fli@@ x spectators , i.e. the reviews they give the shows , their course , what shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but to make a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has a hit to it , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 review on this corner . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot;
&quot; of course , is the question : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; it has two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data sealed . &quot;
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because logic means somehow that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision that one meets , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; what you can expect is good television , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis is not working , this is something terri@@ fying because we live in a period in which we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
knows anyone here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , this is even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever get in touch with this software . get in touch , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if any one here in the U.S. is in prison and ask about dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dis@@ mis@@ sal is done or not . &quot;
&quot; just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided if a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company such as multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most rep@@ uted companies are wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it can be predicted by data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , of a bad way - by analy@@ zing the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully well and was a great news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked properly , year round , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data of rep@@ uted companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all this mistakes , data flows into decisions of life - in the workplace , in the legal framework , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted genetics -- an area where some very smart people uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able to use many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I realized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; as the first step , you put this problem into its parts , so you can analyse the parts ; as a wide , you put the parts back together to take a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : to take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to cr@@ ush a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts and then get into a decision .
there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain .
&quot; when there is something when the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to get together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to write a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think I was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they used data and mind , where they also belong to the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , what else they would otherwise have been able to do . but the decision how to take all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; , &quot; it does not stand in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they were looking at TV ideas , then as they selected &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a secure decision because they could always say : &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool and not to forget that , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions with a Ja@@ ques or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most probably &quot; - right here at this moment . &quot;
I will be able to do it later with a Techni@@ que .
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions in my life so far as I should listen to the ball in retrosp@@ ect . &quot;
&quot; but , as you do of course know if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by something much more out , such as data analysis , to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; perhaps the ball will be smar@@ ter and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve . &quot;
&quot; and I think this is very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still pays off , making decisions to be an expert in what you do , and risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks beautiful .
