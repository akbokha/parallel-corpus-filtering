<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New-York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he spectacularly released, that the NSA heard illegal telephones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence surgery, where the CIA placed on Iran literally for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if it sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">"but do you know, if the chapter did not fall at all?"</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government against Risen has established and prompted him to call for its alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became the symbol of the pattern of the government, whistle-blowers to condemn and journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to First Constitutional Court, the media has the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to use this law if media does not get this information, and if the identity of the mute can not protect it."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government headed down at Risen, he did something that many courageous porters already did before him, he refused, and said that he would rather go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the process, something exceptional."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, even though they were for years of information that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time of electronic monitoring the reporters can always hide themselves less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rather than to fail and bring risen statements, that could also do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, his telephone calls are secret,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just as his e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit card, and even travel-wise with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA wistleblower and risens source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower, but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government has too much of its work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11 almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistle to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work, which should be protected by the first constitutionally, because the government has more options to choose all of them."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed, they are able to contact them from the moment in which they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software, which has not yet been written as risen, and it is much safer than regular e-mails or telephone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transfer system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the internet-famous, which we have been developed by us and today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post office."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send documents, just like every ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these will be encrypted and stored on a server, for which only the relevant news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer provide information to secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">"SecureDrop is however only a small part of the whole, to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are constantly developing new mirragetechnologies that jeopardise us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to make sure that not only technology, such as Edward Snowden have a way to express misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"who wants to report about abuse in the supply of soldiers modest and crowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm to contaminated water from Flint suggests. or a Wallstreet Insider, who warned us ahead of the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only committed to those who want to cover crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on 3 April 2016 the biggest data leak of history has been published.] [the" "Panama Papers" "reveal that Reiche and moist] have hidden in tax havens.] [what does that mean?] [we called Robert Palmer from Global Wadum to have an explanation.] this week we were resident of news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Mosr Fonseca in Panama."</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers at companies such as Mosr Fonseca go and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, exchange of messages, how the whole system works, how it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"also, there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has been in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin, over a close friend of children's days, a famous cello."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous to wait for the next publication, and the next uncovered documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">"now, this sounds like the Plot of a record label or a John-Grisham, novel."</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems crying out of you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we address this?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: when the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all its taxes pay, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Whenish, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"throughout the world, media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax havens are used by a few of them to hide and conceal their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing it for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people this whole world appears very confusing, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine like a matjoschger scene.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that in the US there are fewer reports of this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">"probably, because there were no prominent Americans that occurred in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by principle, after which these tax havens work, Mosr Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some US States you need less information to provide less information to found a company, as to get a librarian proof."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparent in the US has allowed employees from school-quarters to rip school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip especially acute investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global WER we wanted to find out how all this is in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that work?</seg>
<seg id="73">"so, we sent an covered investigation into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan."</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator gave himself as African ministers, who wanted to bring the suspicion money into the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we really shocked that all of us have made suggestions on an attorney of our investigators, how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all accusations. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course nobody was given to the money. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual incidents.</seg>
<seg id="78">"it is not about a single lawyer, which spreads to our covered investigator proposals."</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single leader, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior complicate.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this might sound very dull, as if we could do nothing about it; as if nothing ever had changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful ones."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but when borrowed optimist, I certainly see that some has started to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have looked at more transparency for what the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU is in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how this Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, being used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Whenish this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people, who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headfirms."</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need executives in the economy, who get up and say," Increence is not good for business. "</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it, through laws that end this kind of transparency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can end the intransparence, which now enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I were almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazdas would be landed."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I completed my design studies, I made a backyard sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">"one type in the red mamada remained, and looked at my stuff."</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">"he was alone in the city, and just made a road trip through the whole country. after that, he would go to the peace corps."</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where are you asleep at night?"</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing worse:" "I do not know."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just met him only! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really plans this. I don't want to land up in the trunk of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard about: "I have a air conditioner. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "Are, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was then in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," Oh dear! what did I get there? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A game of living in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I rose out of bed, shut down on toe-pointed, and my sleeping room door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork that he had bought from me is today in his classroom. he is now teachers.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as a stranger, actually friends, who only waited to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"people on my air conditioner to sleep, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's take a leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost banknote, my roommate moves out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I believe, creativity can make it easy to transform fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky:" Brian, I have overlaid out how we could make something about it. our apartment will stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "airbed and breakfast" [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars at the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I am sure our cheese-ham Omeletts tasted completely different, because we did them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them through the whole city. when we took our last guest, and the door fell into the castle, floated Brian and I think."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether one could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented our Investors:" "we want to create a website, on which people post public pictures from their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind room, whose doors you are closing when visiting."</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the internet they can then invite wildly people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not act.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still at solace, would invest in a shop that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you besought to see things that one can eat well. we could be designed."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to designate objects, but now we wanted to create trust through design immense confidence between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be able to do something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a tad, what degree trust we asped."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your Comfortzone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your phone in hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your entanged mobile phone your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this silent place of panic, which you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door the first time."</seg>
<seg id="158">"because the only thing is more personal than your mobile phone, is your home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can read not only your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the tapping cell of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"so, most guests feel when they are staying elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only once so, who has actually Al Gores cell phone? "</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you announce on Twitter so that he would be the president of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbour would have imagined once with his name; if he'd told, where he comes, how his dog or his children will be called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine you would have 150 covers, all of them say," He can really very well detox cell phones! "</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you would have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-designed feedback system strengthens the confidence decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to avert negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"ultimately, we decided to wait until both host and guest had delivered their judgements before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we have conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are about age and home."</seg>
<seg id="178">"a little surprising, we trust the people most, who are most similar."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social predisposition.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting is it when you add the call of a person -- in our case by appraisals.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three assessments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation sticking commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can thus help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"moreover, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get there."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you are too little told, as for example" "hi!", "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"say too much, as for example:" "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request will not be accepted rather. "</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "Tolle artworks in your apartment! I do with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give advice on what topics you should write.</seg>
<seg id="193">"our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help, to overcome our prejudices towards strangers."</seg>
<seg id="194">"with what we had not reckoned, the large amount of people who were more than willing to avert these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people use our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">"second, the tireless work of our team."</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a need that had not been covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business runs very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have allowed unallowed parties or apartments devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have left guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing wrong as these calls. it hurts when I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that one hear in the voice of the callers, was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, the 123 million paid nights had only a fraction ever a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted each other too right.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when confidence works, it is possible to create magnificent."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host went to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donate blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers, which tend to be due to sitting activities to heart attack."</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real protections to save life, even though they don't know anything really."</seg>
<seg id="218">"they drive one in their own car to hospital, if you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they do not want you feel lonely, they bring books over."</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay will run."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure monetary policy are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled about this term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is simply to call" "lease", "the thing does not do justice."</seg>
<seg id="228">"Share Economy describes trade, human relationships promises."</seg>
<seg id="229">"people lay a part of himself open, and that changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="230">"when one travels nowadays, this is fast compared with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but for this less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">"what would be, however, when travelling a rich buffet of local impressions would be?"</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place you have visited, there would be a group where Answer would wait to fill a thoroughly and to show one at a pub that one has never heard;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could get cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays homes are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to share apartments from scratch?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would take the thoughts of the common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine towns that allow ourselves to society and relationships, instead of loneliness and shutoff."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces included in the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">Residents are now offered. students who were looking for a lead.</seg>
<seg id="241">"were conveyed to people whose children were educated. it was started, Incubator programs were started,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share economy. on our platform alone, night 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guests at a stranger or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality has existed before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites to us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has exactly ours work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it stunningly;</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to ponder everytime when a red mada is over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, subjected to brainwashing, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at the safety check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I will not give you the fault for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak to their ber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met a Muslims, It is great to meet you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee elike -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted;</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchteat-Fitness-fanatikerage</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing. spiritual Muslimin.</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not as Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not so born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I met the decision to outen myself.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as homosexual person as some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I chose the hijab to carry my head covering."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friends were horrified," Why oppressed you yourself? "</seg>
<seg id="278">"the Lame was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, namely towards the pressure I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt myself to a perfect and unreachable beauty."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not just accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have taken up with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, was in question, doubtful and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow surrender which deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to crying.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"did you ever feel that someone perceives you, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as engineering."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, a child, and lived basically the" Egyptian American dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that horrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" Eilmessage. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, people spying out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned fast into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I switched to the television channel and heard:" "Muslim terrorists"... "..." in the name of Islam... ""... "</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"not only my country had been attacked, but in the Nu the deeds were related to others of a civil war in a suspicious circle."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start building up studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I cycled -- when we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved this night to our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then heard that I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said," "watchful," "Hod wary," "lead in well illuminated areas," "samplating you not."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people, who held for Muslims, warped and struck."</seg>
<seg id="311">There was really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not right.</seg>
<seg id="314">"because people who have attacked this country, have attacked our country."</seg>
<seg id="315">I swept the anger of people onto the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly declare itself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in that country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish and make mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only raises the question: are we malicious or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor you can see as a whole and a benign tumor one only stops watching.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, Ersthand and Olympiad."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make sure?</seg>
<seg id="331">"maybe there will be a couple of parking spaces free, but not stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to people other faith tolerant, and to show greater citizen participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the area of Washington, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"the radicalization process has been noted that it starts online. as the first one can cut off the person from their church, even by their family, that the person believes that the person is true Muslims, and anyone who abrupt their behaviour and their ideology is a traitor or of faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we need to stop people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim Islam be a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS is founded their brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a person, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would add to their imagination, if one recognizes them as representatives of 1,6 billion believers."</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku fracture with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons on their "sacred book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when one throws a look at it, it doesn't drive them what they read in their" "Holy Scripture." ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they can read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">"a girl came to him, because she had imagined to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. every spiritual, with whom she had spoken, she brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"nothing inspired and something that had given its anger sense, it was a main aim for the instrumentalisation through extremists that gave her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam set the connection to God and her church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accused her of her anger, he showed her constructive ways for real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she kept to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight as the Islamophobia is concerned with me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect regular Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affects our democracy every day on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">"one study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show, if we fear, pass at least three things."</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study reveals: when you report testing messages, negative about Muslims, they voted rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the Rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only a academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look when the mood against Muslims up upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two constituents.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so, Islamophobia is not just the natural reaction of Muslim terror as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulation the public in order to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is an early warning.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear fills us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"in the assignment of collective, it is not just about being able to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both of them went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsmen.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was at the dental faculty, talented, lots of promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would say to me, that he was the sweet, generous man, whom she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is out of my breasts, such a sealed young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne in her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan that was in the afternoon when he posted statements against Muslims on his facebook-site."</seg>

<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we going to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we beset it and for us it was not an easy decision, as it was about which America would leave us to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one where we can freely exercise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat, we drove exhausting, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, drew my shoes out, went into prayer all, and what I saw, let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, printed and was welcomed our guests, because half of the gathered Christians were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, believers and non-believers that were come to attack us, but to join us."</seg>
<seg id="387">In that moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they have courage and compassion panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go to number sure?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you connect to those that mean: we are better than that.</seg>

<seg id="409">"before air package representation into our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of aircraft machines in the Frac Centre in France has built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. a few years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"through interlocking, air devices reach high speed and acceleration in narrowest space."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build up self-constant structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to carry loads, to deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of possible space in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order to work a system autonomously, it needs to know collectively, where the mobile objects are located in the room."</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on rapidly developing dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a offsprings of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board that should do the machine."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest level. for example," "launch" "and". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter.</seg>
<seg id="422">"one airplane, which tries to beat two flies with a cap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other Starrators, it is efficient in advance-trip efficient, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most starters, it can float, and thus has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of mercury is that they are sensitive to turbulences such as wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the air device doesn't matter in which location the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often introduce fundamental abstract questions concerning the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the smallest number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons why we want to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known about as machines with a thousand moving parts that gather together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago I could fly remote-controlled air devices that only had two moving parts: a propeller and a tailruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Unfortunately we discovered that flies with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically customary telescope. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no clap, hinges and cross-rests, no further positional or controllers, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it's mechanically simple, happens in the inside life very much, that it can fly stable and can move over in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the loft. to get it to flying, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability, it's right to throw when all of me watch is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when the monospinner is an exercise in enjoyment, this machine is here, the omkopter with its eight propane, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore it is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"by doing so, he receives the proper capacity,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, no matter which direction he is rotated or even as it is rotating."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propane."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some is conceivable in models, the rest will get directly at flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see this on.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if flying machines must be part of our daily life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made of two separate two-propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">These revolves in the clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When one builds them together they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something wrong, a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly, albeit limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that we are making a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration was examined synthetic swarming.</seg>
<seg id="459">"large number of autonomous, co-ordinated units makes a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took the standard Micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localizing technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">"each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit."</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think of new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially safe machine there I want to be a flying lamp at Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types of us the wage is in development and creation.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures allowing them to form so spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>

<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss of MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech - a giant laser detector to look for gravitational-waves that arise about colonised black holes."</seg>

<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>

<seg id="482">"in the following time, the precision of the LIGO could be substantially increased, which improved the recognition performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">"therefore, it is called Advanced LIGO."</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, LIGO was started for a last test run to clear some minor, persistent issues."</seg>

<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>

<seg id="491">Basically they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">"all this, for what I had worked, is no longer Science Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretic physicists on MIT. he has been studied gravitational-waves from black holes and their by observatories such as LIGO measurable signals."</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a cabling in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when passing the wave, the space and its total content is stretched in one direction and into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"to illustrate, lecturers in courses for relativity is often a really albering dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, each of us was stretched by us during the meeting of the waves and stretched out the stretch of an average human being was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is called 20 zeros after the comma, followed by an 1 Darin, to explain the LIGO staff for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometres long laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length would have to be exactly measured to less than a thousandal of the radius of a nuclear program. this is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"described Kip Thorne, a co-founder Ligos that are hunting for the waves in the following manner:" the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are resourceful, and with the support of the public, certainly all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott maintains that LIGO is more of a ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial excerpts, the size of your cell phone."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite convenient. because in this way you can make an image or a map of things by perceiving the light of several points of light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">At tones it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible notes have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean to you particularly much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we listen to certain properties such as sound base and height, rhythm and volume, to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, just speak Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob underbreaks them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot produce simple pictures from objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by watching changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least lie for LIGO the measured frequencies in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert shaft patterns in loop, we can hear the All literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravitation to listen, can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes, thus my colleague Scott has been very busy for quite a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-speed holes, cirpen simple: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turning the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same circle with an additional sound-change. that sounds like Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement, shaped into the waveshape."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- listened to LIGO following: [Surrendes sound] Yemen and, who knows what he must hear, recognize this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold solar mass, which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixers."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the dense body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, orbit each other one hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO opens an entirely new way to exploring the universe as it was never before possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the All-listen and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- practically or basically -- not to see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a super-nova, for example. I would like to know why to exploded stars in Supernovae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes occur however at the core, which lies behind thousands of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"the gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, because the urchew is covered by its own afterglow."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitational-waves, it should be possible until the beginning back."</seg>
<seg id="542">"most importantly: I am optimistic that there exist in All things that we have never seen before, which we have never seen before, and of which we have no idea of what we just discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, LIGO found right in the first attempt things that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague am MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: Me: the kind of stars that bring black holes, like LIGO they are observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are of the sauerbones for our archeological work. "</seg>
<seg id="546">"LIGO enables us to look at all the events in all, to the emergence of the stars and finally on how we went out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now exists to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circus of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories - a brand new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>

<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Wanted to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, but yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: just what to do, before I feared, there was my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear, to keep speeches, my social fear -- Puff, gone."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes, my life has changed."</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," I changed. "</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life on an unexpected. it started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for unexplained reasons all"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if they were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"valuing, I need milk for my beak-up."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"of a new way of life in my family. from there I swear to play with them, as soon as you ask me to do it. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I always say Yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I am not perfect, but I am trying very much."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, upon my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has a striking side effect: first of short, I actually understood that the" "Yes" "have saved my career with my children."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am authoress. I think things out, wether you to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I Creire TV. I produce TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make TV, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each program offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Say we say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode all nine days of four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, four episodes, 3 episodes: show To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series are running on Thursdays.</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are shows that I have created myself, and not only produced, so still above. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to get my fans around the campfire and to tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire that burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who does that?</seg>
<seg id="598">"nobody, that's why I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think, when the word" "author". ""</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you so that all of you who want to work so hard on whether you're talking about work, a country or a classroom, to take me seriously if I say about work, so you understand that I am not just around the computer, and imaginative, and it is true when I say, I understand that it is not just a dreaming dream."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I'm working much, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">When I go into the work there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when I put troops on, as I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as usual, you have a high tone, lying down a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and rational. and the best thing about it is the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy road, I could always go on it forever."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people take, when I declare to them the buzz that I am writing, writing my joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the buzz - when I began working with television production, when I began to work and work, build up and working together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy. the buzz!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums of action is promotion and activity. the sums of money is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzz is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a buzz, then you cannot take differently from the size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling that can not be different than strive to size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it will also be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I am not for failure, and I know only that I love the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I will only tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I will not ask it into question."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make sure: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more surplus-found boundaries, the more work, the more I watch history, the more I write history, all the more expectations there."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I need to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love working, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country, which I created, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stops.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, overtaken, exaggerated, burned down."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mommy is a single worker.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mommy will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" assessors, I want to go to Shonda country. "</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are baby-titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the buzz hearing."</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine was muddy.</seg>
<seg id="650">I don't loved my work anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums came not back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as usual: the same Titans work, 15 hours days, sculpted weekends, no repentance, nothing delezing, a Titan sleeps, does not exist, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no totality.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was an preview Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" "hay you out, flowerder author Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do, you are doing, you love what you're doing is a banker, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love one another and that gives one the buzz, if you knew the buzz, when the sums stops, who is one then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern waitress" gave me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way outside, late for it and she says," Mama, do you play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I will say no, I will be aware of two things:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she called me not."</seg>
<seg id="675">It does not call anyone more "valuing."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I hate when I am Titan I and my buzz, and here everything changes my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mama, Do you play? "</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," yes. "</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read more dramatic from the book" "Everybody Poops". ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and in the absence of summing, I can do nothing but to match."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quietly.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country, which I created, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, watchdog and the song in which it is going to leave, or whatever the girl in" "The kinggin". ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door passes on and an energy output comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and not immediately, but it happens, it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, barely audible but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a buzz."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the buzz, the working environment, the titanium-summs, this is just the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself through broadcasts and television lessons and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums of money is not a force and it is not specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz depends on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">"the buzz is the river, which comes from the pleasure of life."</seg>
<seg id="711">Real sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real totals are ignoring the pressure of the story, the tasks, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sums of God is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps I whispered God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan I?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, a lot more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"once my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic from any guilt."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice unless I want to hear the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it was so easy. I am not good in games, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"do not play ansatly, as we work."</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts;</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like it to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I always work, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at the workplace as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this entrance is painful, because what a man works rather than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I am."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan, "</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rashes around in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play Ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We Zerburst Seifenbubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always cut off after my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">Yet it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the buzz of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we ever stopped using the game?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also tell it! tell them always Yes when your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you hold me naïve, for a day-dreamer."</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably have right but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you also know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet-Show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes for a maximum of 15 minutes, until they die that they want to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienketle or kisses replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and speak my teenage daughter all 15 minutes long with me, I am mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more needs it not."</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can bring 15 minutes a piece even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children unready. "</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my wellbeing, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is true to feel the buzz, a place for his soul peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it is about joy;</seg>
<seg id="759">"to play" "in general."</seg>
<seg id="760">Allow yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I am not perfect at it. I sheiters and I siege. friends meet, books read, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"if you want to play?" is short for everything I got up, when I got my first TV show when I was playing a Titan in education than I wanted to exceed myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece why not every 15 minutes get enough?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can it be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens up and I find myself in my office. I hear a familiar melody, she meets me and my soul. she leads me to new ideas. I use it into full trains and love my work again."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the buzz, but I do not love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzz, the sums of money is not me... no more. "</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my buzz.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sums of work is part of me, but just a part. and for this I am so grateful."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it is me schnaudoll, that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my bonfires still burn.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the more happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the more clear my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the buzz. the country, which I created, the marathon, whom I run, the canvases, the scanvases, the buzz, the buzz, the other, the right sums, the buzz of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, steady, naked and new feeling of life in me wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this buzz, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am author. I think things out, I weave it to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this belongs to the job, which means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and to more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgical in.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a serious stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe violation of the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, heavy disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I have functional neurosurgical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"for sure, they have heard of one of the most well-known, the" low-stag-stimulation. "this implanted a power of power in the brain to influence the neurons of neurons so that the neurological function improves."</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease that suffered under heavy tremor and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"however, neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">"at the time, I was the leader of the doctor and worked in the emergency one day and night."</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I found patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that in skull-Hirn-traumas the brain climbs and the skull-innruck climates.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, you have to diminish the skull-endruck."</seg>
<seg id="816">"to do this, one must sometimes remove a part of wollen brains."</seg>
<seg id="817">"rather than throwing brain mass, we decided to analyse it with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"cells from a tissues to grow grow, is comparable with very small children that will be taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to thrive them."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it worked for Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the biologian lessons that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into any cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain these kinds of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We did a further fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they split up very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells stopped different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly got off slowly and after a couple of weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but was different."</seg>
<seg id="837">"we needed long to understand, where they came."</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our grandhirnrinse cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"at the stage of the fetus, they ensure the speed of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injury."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand before a potential source of cell that enables brain-healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to see a piece of brain from the non-speaking area and then cultivate the cells to cultivate them as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And they afterwards mark color to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we recalled them at the recording of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation - Autotransmittation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we reproduce these cells in normal brain tissue? and what is going to happen if we reproduce the same cells in temperate brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario, we recalled the cells in a healthy brain, and we watched that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared, they go back home. the room has already been occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we had an injury to and reimplanted exactly the same cells and now the cells are preserved -- they grew up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence that they show are these small points. these are the cells we have in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"here, of course, we could not stop."</seg>
<seg id="864">Will these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain lesion?</seg>
<seg id="865">"so, we trained monkeys with a manual's skill."</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had achieved a stable fate level, we injured the motechnology area in the motorised cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"thereupon, the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hands."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen with people, it recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then they try to recuperate with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they are a certain degree, just as with the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recreation, implantied we had its own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left side they see the monkey, which recovered spontaneously."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the plantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were very exciting results for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found very much more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example Parkinson."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to imitate them in people.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that is wonderful, I'm sure now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can need that. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at people."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one has to fill about two kilograms papers and forms to go through this kind of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time to have a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and trying to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future as many years it will take until someone can get to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical study."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will we allow the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to choose patients to perform the treatments, and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply this to a multi-centric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">"first, one has to really suggest that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone."</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is certain, of course. JB: natural."</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne thank you for your visit at TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality, but as inventories of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchangeable gearing.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great afternomer in Beijing have proven beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressing growth, while politics remains completely non-democratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy comes up with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- not likely to influence the austerity programmes that have been realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my Ascended friends, who repeatedly told me that democracy would change if they would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to introduce an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you to believe in common with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup of an error, we could save the democracy, but that we need a true and defenceless democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies are painted, our future gloomy, and our great, new technologies wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of extravagance, I would like to refer you to an interesting contradiction, which is currently under threat to our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "Twin Summit Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain, which throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his tin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the high level of austerity and corporations, which, however, are too anxious, where it would be productive and income, with which you need to wear the debt recovery and also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion dollars were invested in the US, in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, quiet, equipment and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion US dollars sounds after much money, until one compares it to the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time in the same countries as well as our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock exchange and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and unproductive capital form the twin summit, which is not equal due to the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year-old in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, which would not invest in which they do not invest. exactly like Odipus Father who would not invest in which they wouldn't invest. exactly like Odipus Father who would not invest in which they would kill him if he will grow,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Unrolled the circumstances leads to that Ödipus is killing him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hasty with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"its extremely concealous capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents, and especially all the technologies to finance" green "technologies that are crucial for saving the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue. but before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">"Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form, in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority."</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian Democracy naturally closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be an error to minate the significance of the athic democracy due to these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the judgment of the Athenian democracy was and is that she gave the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of speech, but more important and more decisive for them to give them the right to political co-determination in questions of the state of state."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not long been held --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which shines very bright, it is also rapidly burned out."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our current liberal democracies does not have their roots in the ancient Athens."</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for Herrschende."</seg>
<seg id="940">"for the liberal democracy only came up, as a complete separation of politics and business was possible and the democratic process was introduced to politics, while the economy -- the world of corporations - a democratic zone was established."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our today's democracies has been taking place since the time of which this separation of politics and business began, a relentless struggle between the two and the economy gradually submits its policies to politics."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer as they did before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not part of a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because you can still be in the government today and yet do not believe in power, because the power of politics is aboutated and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hasty with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"when you think about it, it is in about just like a flock of predators, which has so sustainably the animals, from which they nourishes, deceived, that they are starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy, which has become so far cannized by the self-causing economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, political goods grows, the overall economic demand falls and the general manager of the corporations are frightened to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful of capitalism distributes the" "demos" "[the people] out of democracy the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the welfare of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"it is obvious that we have to bring politics and the economy back together, and it would be better if the" "demos" "hold control as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea by the way.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea a hundred years ago and it wasn't very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position like in the ancient Athens without creating new types of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to save the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing Niedribbutz through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem with this is how long business and politics are separate, the automation summit will be higher, the extravagance and social conflicts are deeper, just as it's been very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we need to reshape the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and thereby respect for the uniting territory, otherwise we end up in a disease surveillance hyperautocracy that will appear the film" "Matrix" "like a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"therefore, the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements that he brought forth to survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in" "matrix Trek", "in which machines serve people and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athener" Agora, "in long talks the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">"I believe, we must be optimistic."</seg>
<seg id="960">So what could it look like could it look to have this "star Trek" like utopia rather than the "matrix" -similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from a job office to the next, and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is property of those who currently work in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then all incomes come from capital and from income, and the concept of wage labour is completely outdated."</seg>
<seg id="964">"there is no distinction between those who belong to the companies, which are not working in it, and employees working there, but no more exchange between capital and labour, no major gaps between investment and austerity, and ultimately no scented twin summit."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please note that our national currencies would have a free exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 largest threshold countries], in the interest of all mankind."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trading is acted in this currency -- we call it" "Cosmos", "in units of" Cosmos "- and each government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade union of the respective country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is invested in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investments are scarce."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that it was not the technical means at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, in particular, we have in particular the background of a reunited politics and business."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world that I describe you is at the same time liberalisation, in which it privileged people prefer, and Marxist, because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and keynesianese, global keynote."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to deal with politics.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and business is... do not do it, technological development will produce such massive decline in economic demand, which Larry Summon is known as" "long term stagnation." ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we experience it currently, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interests are low in liberally democracy."</seg>
<seg id="985">"when this analysis is correct, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"like Hayek, this is why I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that is why I am also completely wirh."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: indeed, and now we are at ease too."</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not wirh you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers, you have said very clearly what you think from the West's view to China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the semblance of Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy on policy, while the area where most of the economy takes place -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a certain way, when I can say that provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"because -- remember -- we tend to reconnect liberalism with democracy -- this is an error, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism and Liberal as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical of what the democratic development concerns.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can be observed in China is similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners were curious about your experience as the finance minister of Greece in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I ahned that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal standpoint, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to start with the Eurozone a new beginning,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely to adopt ourselves from self-sufficiency, and the continuous denial which ran into a massive reduction line through the euro zone, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way, the first suggestion was that this denial was revealed --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"it is correct to do. unfortunately, the powers inside the Eurozone, within the European group, continues to deny the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one is trying to get an economic system that is not viable, by political will and authoritarianism in life, it may be hesitant for a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes are you looking ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister or a minister who claims after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, he claimed no mistakes, then that is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">"I believed that there was an honest interest on the pages of the donor, to find a common solution."</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they merely wanted to bring our government to fall, just because they did not want to deal with the convulsions caused by the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to confess that they have been a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominate GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"there is worse than during the" "Great Depression." ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the Troika's troika who has imposed us this policy: "this was a colossal error."</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive Tons of talks, you seem to be still quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from someone who lives and love Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1030">"" "my greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive."</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if they did not survive, the shared fliers will be demonised and the European Union will destroy."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not be disastrous for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we allow ourselves to strike the way of a post-modern 1930, what appears to me, it will be as well tolerable for the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you're wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">"Yanis, thank you for you were at TED."</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"by Roy Price, most of which have never heard before, although he probably is responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a representative of Amazon Studios</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a hedger and describes it on Twitter as" Films, TV, Technology, Tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for making the shows and the contents to reproduce the Amazon."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very tough industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are at the right side of this turn."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDb website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review get.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is evaluated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" "Breaking Bad", "" Game of Throne, "" The Wire "-- all the shows, the addictive ones, where, after you looked a season, your brain asks," Where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows like" Toddler and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price doesn't care about to get onto the left side of the curve, because I think it needs special intelligence to subordinate" Toddler and Tiaras "." "</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the mean exploiters, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they are simply not thrilled."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes it something, so Roy Price wants nothing to risk."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he has guaranteed success, so he will hold a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"it takes many ideas for TV shows and selects an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where everyone can view them free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon exist out in vain things, one does not attack properly?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers have a look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they don't know that they will be observed when watching this shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who are recording everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you can capture when you start the Show, when you pause, which parts you can skip and again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">Collect millions of data to determine which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, collect the data, process these and it results in response, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom over four Republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">You made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"Alpha House," "Alpha House", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of these curve 7.4 is and Alpha House lands at 7,5 -- that is something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time at another company, another manager has placed a top show by Data Analysis. its name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of organizing a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data on Netflix spectators, i.e. the reviews they give the shows, their course, what shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators, but to make a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards ". Netflix has a hit to it, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 review on this corner. so exactly where they wanted to go. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, is the question: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"it has two very competitive, data sealed."</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic means somehow that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision that one meets, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"what you can expect is good television, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis is not working, this is something terrifying because we live in a period in which we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Knows anyone here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, this is even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever get in touch with this software. get in touch, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if any one here in the U.S. is in prison and ask about dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dismissal is done or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided if a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company such as multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most reputed companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it can be predicted by data analysis outbreaks of flu, of a bad way - by analyzing the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully well and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked properly, year round, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of reputed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all this mistakes, data flows into decisions of life - in the workplace, in the legal framework, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very smart people unimaginable to use many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I realized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as the first step, you put this problem into its parts, so you can analyse the parts; as a wide, you put the parts back together to take a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: to take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to crush a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts and then get into a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"when there is something when the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to get together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to write a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think I was Netflix so successful because they used data and mind, where they also belong to the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, what else they would otherwise have been able to do. but the decision how to take all these parts, and make it a show like" House of Cards "," it does not stand in the data. "</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first as they were looking at TV ideas, then as they selected" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a secure decision because they could always say: "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool and not to forget that, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 Ball ". it is amazing. for decisions with a Jaques or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." most probably "- right here at this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will be able to do it later with a Technique.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have made some decisions in my life so far as I should listen to the ball in retrospect."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you do of course know if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by something much more out, such as data analysis, to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"perhaps the ball will be smarter and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I think this is very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still pays off, making decisions to be an expert in what you do, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
