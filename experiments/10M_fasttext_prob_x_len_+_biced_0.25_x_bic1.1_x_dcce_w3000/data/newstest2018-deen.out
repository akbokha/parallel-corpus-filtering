Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards to change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt where youth should meet today .
a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle which is now buried for the S @-@ Bahn Tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers provide the one @-@ term basis for farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it &apos;s annoying when landing cards are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; everybody knows each one who had to ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ate itself , because the car Nav@@ i took place in a green meadow instead of an envel@@ op . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but just therefore very enligh@@ tening . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread @-@ area of Munich Mercury has changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ cal work that one does not recognize as such .
&quot; in the great over@@ sight map , for cities and municipalities are more detailed maps , so @-@ called Ur@@ posi@@ tional datas@@ he@@ ets . &quot;
these emerged according to the Bay@@ er@@ is@@ cation administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and ski@@ pping of the first measurement of Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French military guide held Bavaria from the spring of 1800 during the Second Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ war with Austria .
Napoleon wanted to get an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographical inclusion of Bavaria &apos;s order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops mar@@ ched with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 , there were today &apos;s neighbors that created the idea of a nationwide Bayern @-@ map . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ mess@@ ing Management . &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ tional sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all the others to be found on the Bay@@ erische National Library .
the comparison of E@@ arly / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ ver@@ d@@ ling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
&quot; Send@@ ling was cancelled 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 1877 , as Munich district . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling lies in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses in Lower Saxony focus around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the revolt of Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : in Hin@@ di zo@@ oming , a smaller red card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written number@@ ing from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Ur@@ up@@ take &quot; , &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
small plots do not occupy there today no farmers - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 Schau@@ ch of the October Revolution , was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert . &quot;
on the other side of Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the Ur@@ posi@@ tional sheet , one reads in the area of today &apos;s district of A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only the street names &quot; at the guest &quot; &quot; or from the hill &quot; &quot; On the ventilation &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse , there were once people with madness . &quot;
there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich district of Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt on the Au@@ er air .
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard headed by Gu@@ dden the institution - the psychiat@@ rist , who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was advanced for his time and ended up , for example , the chains of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he is forbidden to apply the personnel to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen who has engaged in an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; initially , for 280 patients , it was first place , later on 500 places was expanded . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the county seat in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; there since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ east , one of the largest psychiat@@ ry in Germany . &quot;
on the A@@ real of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt we meet young people in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order expected the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with training .
&quot; west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich east , east residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; was built in architec@@ turally based on the origins of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt that had been destroyed during the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed in 18@@ 56 as &quot; main square , &quot; the department store was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies in December 1944 take many holes in the city center .
a big stayed until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business buildings and a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages was once the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where those days were working on the ground and on 5 April 2017 the sp@@ ade for the second S @-@ Bahn members . &quot;
with the sli@@ der the old Munich map can be compared with the air picture of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
civil rights group published travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the promotion of colored has issued a warning for colorful people based on discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks of the state to Mis@@ sour@@ i .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel advisory for the federal state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , who will come into force by 28 August 2017 , call special attention to visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ an@@ ists , since a number of questionable , predat@@ ory @-@ based incidents in the whole state will occur and here , &quot; &quot; says it in the statement of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it people harder to gain dis@@ crimin@@ ation , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state , the dis@@ proportion@@ ately proportionate to minorities , prompted the group to set out the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of civil rights that humans happen .
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are assembled or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency , which we have not heard yet . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group quoted as a rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year , after having had no more gasoline anymore during the journey through the state , and taken by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i in custody without a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the General Office of Mis@@ sour@@ i , in which black drivers in the state will be 75 per cent more common than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be ready to bring any Cau@@ tion and let the relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i described in 2015 100 , hate @-@ hate speech , after the latest figures from the hate @-@ breaking reporting of the F@@ BI , which constituted the state with regard to the number of such injuries on the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
&quot; the time of travel is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it more difficult to complain a company because of housing or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties ( AC@@ L@@ U ) Trav@@ elling for Texas and Arizona , following the states of immigration laws , committed local law enforcement agencies to conce@@ al people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial legislation . &quot;
&quot; travelling war@@ es are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in recent times , stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
past@@ ure project is elementary
the Fis@@ bacher Wei@@ ght fence project is a success project and will be continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Parliam@@ ents Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have created a picture on site .
at the right @-@ grab@@ en@@ hof of the Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann family representatives of the Fis@@ bach CD@@ U local network met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members .
&quot; Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann granted initial insight into his operations , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk cells and also many young animals , and in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este hosts . &quot;
&quot; black milk @-@ milk &quot; is for him the alternative mark@@ eter path for the milk of his cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este occurs exclusively region@@ ally .
&quot; as he is also BL@@ H@@ V chairman of the fisher@@ man , he described the past@@ ure project as &quot; elementary &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I can act on such steep areas not profitable .
&quot; the green area care for a lot of work , much must be processed with the engine sense . &quot;
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; stressed Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 he took over the el@@ eventh operation and generated this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zers , even if he did not conduct bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognized the meaning of the past@@ ure of wheat , and is pleased with the leader promotion . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
one hope that the re@@ for@@ estation of surfaces could be brought up for quite a while .
&quot; the biggest treasure we have , are the people working in agriculture and make thoughts of how they continue their operations , &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot;
farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion of funding
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 . &quot;
the disclosure area is 40 hectares that can not be stopped until at least 20@@ 23 .
&quot; the total cost of 71 500 euros was funded half by leaders , a quarter contributed to the town of Fis@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers left 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of past@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the longevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; declared Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and women , it does not go . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter white stood firm : &quot; &quot; here best food is produced . &quot;
the landsc@@ ap@@ ery ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state promotion of wheat @-@ coated .
the goal is the disclosure of the Schwar@@ zw@@ alds .
the condition is the presence of one of the L@@ PR @-@ recorded conve@@ y@@ isse .
&quot; moreover , the in@@ vigor@@ ous surface must not be sh@@ ly cont@@ emp@@ tible ( Hang@@ ing over 35 percent ) and therefore must be threatened by the recovery . &quot;
&quot; for the fisher@@ man Wei@@ discreet project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build approximately 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure of 35 hectares , the Calabri@@ an costs are more than 112 000 Euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty in front of
the safest sign of a regime transfer is it when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic A@@ xt in a h@@ it@@ ant dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta on the proposals of the president to the dras@@ tic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators would have denied him if he had done it .
&quot; but he attacked their importance , and in particular the meaning that it was written , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus , was 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base was added . &quot;
&quot; to Miller A@@ co@@ sta : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go down here to a full thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that the world illuminated . &quot;
the poem which you refer to later was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is correct properly , but as he himself formulated it , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about contemporary resonance on the upright words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state will not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; &quot; your exhausted , your poor , / your sup@@ pressed masses that would like to breathe free , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; miserable waste &quot; on our screen was better to see .
Miller did not dev@@ ise himself in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps .
this conflict due to the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural struggle : it is in fact a conflict in the importance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who put themselves in place to place their words after her death at the base - knew very well that they have taken a high political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Re@@ public@@ anism by showing the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a fully exploited .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminine cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and precisely how Lazarus changed the significance of the statue , people wanted to switch from the right wing this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the big scribe , Rus@@ h Lim@@ it@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued that the Statue of Liberty no one dra@@ wer but rather an early neo @-@ conservative was that the American flame is in the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is proceeding . &quot;
it is intended to carry the F@@ ack@@ el of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the F@@ ack@@ el is not supposed to enligh@@ ten the way to the United States .
rather unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something hit .
the significance of the statue is entirely at all a matter of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus consisted of Lazarus to see them as they were seen from the exhausted , but hope@@ ful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships . &quot;
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump will ever recognise .
&quot; their tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred , which is their only source of power , ign@@ ite . &quot;
world Championships 2017 : Neil Black lo@@ ra@@ zed members of the UK &apos;s team
E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle reminds itself of a time when only two sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain .
&quot; the director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Congress of the World Championship has a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes selected for London 2017 that starts on Friday .
black believes that in Scotland something special develops and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue until we find it , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think there is something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think there is something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy on the corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ovo - which will compete against Sir mon Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m stretch , while E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle was elected by the team to the team member . &quot;
&quot; E@@ eli@@ dh is quite modest .
&quot; her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were sho@@ ot@@ tically or wherever they live or train , went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feel that E@@ ili@@ dh was totally natural , were magnificent . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth of silver medal , who will compete in their fifth World Championships in the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the mid @-@ range Mu@@ ir Mu@@ ir leads on this path and has put up five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runners . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1.500 m is running , is another Scot@@ sman which one should look after a great season that included victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle remembers its first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
&quot; the Mann@@ es@@ try captain says that they are &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; to the fact that many of their country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases also join the medals and the Fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special about this team captain came to be in it that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour , but to know that my team @-@ mates voted for me and have chosen , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the vill@@ i who belong to the team . &quot;
it shows only how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to rise on Po@@ dies . &quot;
what my speech concerns as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back in the Olympiastadion .
&quot; I get a second chance to go there and compete , and it will be so a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
blocking critic on Facebook : Be@@ ver@@ b not a public office if you cannot tolerate the he@@ aters of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last long until the newspapers struck him because of all , from domestic politics to its political principles . &quot;
&quot; he sm@@ ashed in criticism , safe . &quot;
but he did not have his critics to silence .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we will lead the sheep to the slaugh@@ tering . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to governor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who must work on it to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinions on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties promised him this week in the beginning of this week .
&quot; the rod of the govern@@ ors sent the law@@ suit as a fri@@ vo@@ l , and the line comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a guy like Ho@@ gan .
&quot; this is a republi@@ can governor in a overwhelming democratic state , which is amazing . &quot;
he has the two @-@ ranking approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary instrument to dis@@ connect with its voters and to debate his ha@@ ar@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the block@@ age of persons who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum that is called officially and paid by employees who are paid by public tax @-@ Dollars - unnecessary , and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan Spe@@ cher@@ in Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the Govern@@ ors and argued that the block@@ ade of comments is nothing more than a moderation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of tro@@ lls or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ water @-@ filled people , which vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p . &quot;
the post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no tro@@ lls . &quot;
&quot; they all said their comments are respectful , thoughtful and not profound . &quot;
the pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic Faith .
&quot; lawyer &apos;s Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ water @-@ filled , but she asked to break hate . &quot;
&quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate hate and other latest news , &quot; wrote them in the commentary area of the news release &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea , if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are mis@@ understood by some rather than so @-@ called collective action and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the employees of the govern@@ ors referred to as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; , &quot; others would probably call &quot; inter@@ ce@@ tic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by removing a critic , or deleted a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is much clean@@ er than in former times when you have done the same thing that employees have been sent to gather newspapers with critical heads and to burn or burning prot@@ esters , and to silence . &quot;
but this is precisely what happens digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter @-@ users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first milestones in this question coinci@@ ded last week in Virginia .
&quot; the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors , Lou@@ dou@@ n County exp@@ elled the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to the U.S. District of James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they proclaimed a vot@@ er from their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Be@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
it should not be so difficult .
&quot; at present , Washington &apos;s time had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ ly between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous brie@@ fs sm@@ ashed on his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had an anonymous tro@@ lls .
&quot; the people , used pseudon@@ y@@ me such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers , which made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , which critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and navigation with Great Britain , overwhel@@ m his office , according to historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not have them sil@@ enced .
&quot; freedom of expression , opinion of opinion and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true guidance means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty is hoping for domestic comfort during the next three days , as the Renaissance Club is hosted in East Lot@@ to the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who resulted in the Ar@@ cher@@ field left until the end of the year before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is linked to the new auction location and acts as tournament message on behalf of the club @-@ founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built and we see how he reaches its glory with this event , &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best , he is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry made a great job than he put this place .
he is a eager supporters of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the English language is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career at the European Tour as well as at the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels special , &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open as they last year after I had won them , from the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to golf .
the memories of the last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
Gary Or@@ r who came to the European Senior tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year .
this event will be his first Scottish show since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I have played a solid golf course .
&quot; I am glad , as far as I did . &quot;
&quot; with the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ faculty . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six flo@@ cks in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ All@@ ister , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; the entrance is free , the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with an in@@ mates and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all profits go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive smoke
in the past two decades less people died because of pas@@ si@@ vity of lung cancer .
&quot; at this result , scientists from the University Hospital of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come in a study . &quot;
&quot; according to our estimates a year 16@@ 7 lung cancer can be attributed to passive smoke , &quot; said Studien@@ companion Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he moved up his own study on this issue of 1994 . &quot;
at that time there are still 400 lung cancer cases given to pas@@ si@@ vity per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
domestic connections prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Street are in full swing and &quot; &quot; reasonably in time &quot; , &quot; as the leader of the building Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the household closures , the situation is more complicated than suspected , because in the underground there is much se@@ amounts , which is not noted in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which always hin@@ ders the construction work , represents a major problem for the construction tr@@ up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of the drivers in front of red lights and se@@ ams is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is locked and only the buses are eligible for transit .

poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian Gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i cooked dinner , she uses no stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ iment in the un@@ quiet in@@ dones@@ ian Province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife is normally called a sweet potato - locally as &quot; &quot; not@@ a &quot; &quot; - directly into the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour the cr@@ ush was taken with di@@ lig@@ ently , un@@ brid@@ led hands and swal@@ lowed . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay , she has no furniture - where she also performs its daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp to wash . &quot;
a bu@@ cket in a roof@@ ed space serves as Lat@@ est .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , you have not been assigned fields . &quot;
Poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , too late can be too dangerous : most village men are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody w@@ akes it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village ro@@ aming , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia than just 1,0@@ 26 elders by public transport in front of the occupation forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch rule , turned out quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which includes control of the region and foreign journalists or legal entities . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea &apos;s eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rental car .
there are no public transportation .
&quot; the town with approximately 19@@ .000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ boo poles , and from cor@@ ru@@ d@@ ops which were converted by r@@ ust in various gel@@ b@@ brown tones . &quot;
&quot; very few In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , ref@@ uses journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans got a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to their lively , handmade tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and their bright rock . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is an impover@@ ished province where 28 % of the people live under the poverty line and some of the worst inf@@ ant and alphabe@@ tis@@ ation rates in Asia have .
but it is also In@@ don@@ esi@@ ens Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and profitable gold mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has built a value of € 3.@@ 1 billion and copper in the value of € 3.@@ 1 billion . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has a wealth of resources valued at estimated 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; these riches are however a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , who make sure that in@@ th@@ esi@@ ens are becoming a sti@@ ck@@ ery presence . &quot;
&quot; a study conducted by 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port local military deployment and units between 1998 and 2004 was nearly 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ lian demands for greater autonomy threaten this Golden G@@ ans and are treated mer@@ ciful .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indones@@ ian military . &quot;
mass@@ acres in Pap@@ u@@ as stem cells in 1970 @-@ 2000 years were referred to as genocide by the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police held more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the past year alone . &quot;
&quot; we value all &quot; &quot; lose all &quot; &quot; means in a report by the Arch@@ diocese Bris@@ bane from the year 2016 , in the reports of atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as legal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electro@@ des are particularly popular according to another report - and brutal rainf@@ all demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since each week &apos;s incidents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
bol@@ ts have intensified since Pap@@ u@@ as resources can produce a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is about 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing , as Muslim economic migrants are transformed by the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung @-@ cant@@ ines sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut . &quot;
local people fight to stay here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell h@@ ens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; says A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ local , who moved to the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
it has the native Pap@@ ua - the m@@ um mom@@ my &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market costs .
&quot; the Indones@@ ian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the Volk@@ mar and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address the inequalities and breaches of breaches in Pap@@ ua during his election , 2014 . &quot;
the former carp@@ enter 27 of the altogether 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel betrayed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with anticip@@ ation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October . &quot;
on 7 December 2014 a group of 11 children out there and sang Christmas lie@@ der in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali as two Indones@@ ian soldiers on a motorcycle through the darkness .
the sc@@ ro@@ cked children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers rose to her tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , j@@ agu@@ ed , and smote the group with their gun , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , became so hard that he fell into the coma . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the building of the nearby government Commission was placed on fire and the things escal@@ ate the next day . &quot;
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves together on a football ground before the local police station and the military commander , to demand justice . &quot;
they bore cerem@@ onial Jag@@ db@@ ö@@ gen and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and a bird @-@ p@@ ang imi@@ ti@@ ingly - of Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago strain .
some demonstr@@ ators began to drag stones to police and military post .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers was sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; &quot; if the masses do more than three times resistance , they shoot them dead , &quot; &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released by the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ emi@@ as Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ pping danger and called after peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was able to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my lin@@ t @-@ wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his multic@@ ol@@ oured wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still does not know who has been fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered together . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his C@@ ousin , the witness of the sho@@ ots was . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and studied his body to make sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who bears only one name like many in@@ don@@ esi@@ ans , the TI@@ ME in dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the editor @-@ spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Re@@ porters , that his officers wanted to secure their station only &quot; &quot; because they will be attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others wounded . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings arrived only on the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Com@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and sw@@ or to tackle historical abnorm@@ alities in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case immediately to be resolved , so that in the future it will no longer happen &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Security Minister of Safety Authority said in October 2016 , that he may set out a court mechanism for the acceptance of historic human rights ab@@ uses . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of 2000 @-@ years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that have to go through , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
then there was a retreat when he spoke to Jak@@ arta on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he didn &apos;t have any plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the Wir@@ anto , which charged the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua had already been attached , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims received such allegations with gri@@ mm@@ m unbeliev@@ ing .
&quot; I was interviewed in the last three years , but there was no progress &quot; , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he is still living in fear for years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , have fear to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was struck by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police on villagers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between village residents and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were wounded , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w who was drunk in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
ambitious villagers prot@@ ested before the sit@@ ing office of the company .
&quot; the police said that the villagers were throwing stones at officers , who reacted to them by pressing warning @-@ sh@@ uts . &quot;
but natives say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot a lot and killed a killing .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witness how the injured here has been delivered quickly , so the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden me two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to account the participating officers to account and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a ru@@ d@@ ge@@ ars for the Indones@@ ian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal , mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the Reb@@ el@@ ist army , which claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by inv@@ ade spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and imprisoned in the last few years under the pretext of &quot; safeguarding the national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some will never dive again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dissatisfaction .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as apart .
people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of the women who are able to edit four or five fields of the sweet potato .
they reserve the most part of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces Not@@ a valuable only 10,000 in@@ dones@@ ian R@@ up@@ ies ( 75 C@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic inequalities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire in larger numbers are arrived . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs that exist in the region , usually go to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants . &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to manage their own companies competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Board of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions of the coverage of international media remain tense . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ das and Basi@@ lls Long@@ cham@@ p became de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they gave them the rare permission of the movies . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is electoral campaign , the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development , are not realised . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report from in@@ th@@ esi@@ ens un@@ troubled provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua to report : visa denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; the lack of press control means that international pressure is largely restricted to the Indones@@ ian government , largely on the immediate neighbors of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in March , six Pacific states - Ton@@ ga , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ine and the Sal@@ om@@ ons Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widespread injury &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian foreign minister Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so that it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights incidents . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right ambassador Ke@@ es Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited her silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source which also participated in the meeting , but remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia , there is a further presidential election to 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua would say they will probably not be back for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is involved by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Chief Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in arms and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai folks , like other Pap@@ ua , her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and intimi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ uss@@ sion resulted in the last symbolic act of the Des@@ p@@ ite : the cor@@ pse of a victim was buried on a site just across the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that perhaps they will never come up with justice , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; one member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a strong head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scr@@ aper of Dubai for the second time
&quot; on Friday , a fire found on Friday in one of the highest dwelling towers of the world in Dubai its transit and sp@@ ang hundreds of inhabitants , from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ story building to flee . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that has triumph@@ ed in just two years through the high house , that one gets stuck to the Tor@@ ch @-@ Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building has been ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries have not been reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we slept well and we got up with fire alarm and scre@@ aming the people . &quot;
&quot; we ran@@ ged the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50@@ th floor down@@ wards , &quot; told a resident of his name as George ang@@ ab , Re@@ uters . &quot;
&quot; Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) , the fire extingu@@ ished and the building ch@@ ained . &quot;
the government said they work in providing accommodation for those affected .
&quot; the incident can be re @-@ revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials , which are used in foreign countries around the world . &quot;
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damage from the dis@@ guise , the outer cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation , came . &quot;
&quot; in the UK , the police , they believe that the system of plates for insulation and dis@@ guise at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a meeting in which approximately 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through its big Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the A@@ GM .
&quot; at the session in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the for this Sport @-@ revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup singles only have to play on two profits , Hau@@ ch@@ thin@@ ly is not supported by the necessary two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; the most often very long , but even so much appreciated five @-@ set classics will remain with the tradition of tradition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 per cent of member countries voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only barely missing . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; Hag@@ ger@@ ty told us . &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the consumption .
&quot; at all , not only for the vote was before the proposal that the proposal came to a neutral place after the vote . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : thus , the fin@@ alists will be at the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in future in the first round the hosts &apos; right . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the cost of the organizer , the requirements in terms of training places etc. are facilitated and the players will need less official media dates before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 of 5 US travelers , bot@@ tom@@ ed items to the plane , will find a survey . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted in flight passengers yiel@@ ded that more than 20 percent are aware or un@@ consciously delayed items to the Control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent that came the airplane while they accidentally received kni@@ ves or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent asser@@ ted that they would have been delayed that they mistak@@ enly have traveled with s@@ war@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey conducted more than 1,000 people - who was conducted by a Jet Charter Service , Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also fixed that younger travellers rather pay the rules . &quot;
&quot; asked by the respon@@ dents that they kno@@ w@@ ingly tried to fly with something that were banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 per cent of Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were . &quot;
&quot; the most common items , which have been performed by T@@ SA agents , were foods and liquids . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 percent were made to know kno@@ w@@ ingly objects with blades through the safety control , whereas 2,@@ 2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 per cent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they have been able to obviously have brought drugs into the plane . &quot;
&quot; the company said , I interviewed travelers across the country to find out how many accidentally smug@@ glers had brought from the airport security and how many could have done it . &quot;
&quot; it is not a surprise that the people , most likely to smug@@ gling smug@@ gling - kno@@ w@@ ingly or un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly - by safety wear , those that were most often flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing . &quot;
people are often unsure which fluids may take them or how much of it .
&quot; therefore , there is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA conf@@ is@@ cated items . &quot;
&quot; a time for the people , the T@@ SA could view books as smug@@ glers . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it worth : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la clients canc@@ elling order
&quot; electro @-@ thou@@ sand@@ s@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k gives a huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; until now , he has so far been able to say that a part of the customer has already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the always triumph@@ ant figures in sales degrees and still gigantic sales targets Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time to reveal another , less glaz@@ ing number : the cancellations made in the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months Mus@@ k has often applied with the more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery straight begins . &quot;
&quot; now , Mus@@ k is a : from the altogether 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3,000 has already been withdrawn . &quot;
critics always had pointed out that it is only a non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pound ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; currently 45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are currently sm@@ ashed within a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , that the cancellation of up to twelve percent of all orders could be made to the problem , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production site . &quot;
last year Tes@@ la delivered Tes@@ la 8@@ 4.000 vehicles .
&quot; by 2018 it will be - all models taken together - 500,000 , by 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is evident .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1800 reservations available per day . &quot;
&quot; those who today order a &quot; Model 3 &quot; must be expected early in the second half of 2018 , when Tes@@ la creates it , its brand new , never in practice tested production streets without major inter@@ rup@@ tions , with maximum utilisation . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , it comes to major delays , then the uni@@ formity of reservations could be the issue for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company does not get satisfied customers to go away in swe@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt draws attention due to the delays of the rules of the Obama Era to reduce emissions , &quot;
&quot; a day after being killed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the Environmental Protection Authority , received his earlier decision to reduce the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions smo@@ g @-@ based air pollutants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as its agency proved to meet the needs of state @-@ governmental authorities compared to the previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint against his previous position in a state of occupation .
&quot; it is a deadline , which ran out on 1 October for states to adhere to the standards of 2015 for down @-@ down o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will delay the compliance with a year to study his authority more time , to study the plan and to avoid taking into local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s pro@@ secutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent to take severe environmental protection rules . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly pointed to blocking or delay the rules of chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden conversion of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ gated regulatory agenda agenda .
&quot; last month , a federal tribunal in Washington decided that the EPA has passed its authority than he tried to make the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas company to monitor and reduction of meth@@ ane le@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; in one on the Wednesday night , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his revers@@ als in o@@ zone standards simply struck the willingness of EPA for cooperation with the countries through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards ampli@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; under former administr@@ ations , EPA has often tried the deadlines for the implementation and then waited to set the appointment for the implementation of activists and others , and in an agreement to set the appointment for the implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who said the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also accept the law and authority we take , seriously . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the statement of EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt sometimes use his &quot; authority to the delay and all the other legally available &quot; &quot; to make sure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Re@@ public@@ ans in Congress are pushing for more comprehensive re@@ vis@@ ing of the o@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a bill &apos;s draft law was to delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years . &quot;
the measure was not yet placed in the Senate .
&quot; the New York &apos;s general pro@@ secutor Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the states who had compl@@ ained the EPA in this week , said the Group intended to maintain the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the revers@@ al of EPA - according to our chambers - is an important asset for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New York , and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g , said in their con@@ gregations . &quot;
&quot; new York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Maine , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; soil o@@ zone is created when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil raff@@ les , chemical properties and other sources are responding to sunlight . &quot;
&quot; the standing smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year will contribute to thousands of premature deaths . &quot;
representative of the public health system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists also che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ gated course change .
&quot; it is dist@@ res@@ sing how much pressure it needs to get this reasonable step from those responsible for the protection of air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot;
&quot; we need to continue fighting against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government , to get poll@@ uted to environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot;
tum@@ our celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius
&quot; 750 years St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche is invited to the old cemetery @-@ realistic in turmoil on Sunday , 16 July to 16.@@ 30 clock for a Seren@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; whether it is an idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius is a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth benefit seren@@ ade can be enchanted by this powerful place .
saving and preserving the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors for their concerns .
Walter Martin@@ i stresses : &quot; it is a unique village of village . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle has been mentioned for the first time in the Wur@@ ttem@@ berg of judgment : count Hermann from Sul@@ z &quot; &quot; the mountain with the church at the church of Tum@@ lingen and Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard of Hor@@ b and his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the wording of the certificate in accordance with the tum@@ our mountain , apart from the suff@@ oc@@ ation of the church there was a great court , to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age was quite belonged and not the other way round . &quot;
so there are also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , it was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today in the village of Tum@@ lingen are still to be recognized , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the splendid settlement of the village . &quot;
old cards from the time around the year 1600 under@@ pin these historical conditions .
the Pat@@ ron@@ age was born in the Middle Ages of the Middle Ages .
&quot; one Lord , who built a church and occupied himself , and occupied with a priest , continued fitness for this church and could inher@@ it this property as well . &quot;
associated with it was the right to take a pastor or to propose a new parish priest .
three alt@@ ars were there in the church and two bells in the tower .
the greatest of the two crum@@ ble at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created glob@@ es then moved in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later during World War II in 1942 . &quot;
in the 30 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the shut@@ ters were stolen and the clock parts were stolen .
the roof was un@@ dense .
in 17@@ 96 French troops in the vicinity of the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church dro@@ wn 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery was also used as the last resting place for the dead from listening .
&quot; in 18@@ 23 , the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was abandoned . &quot;
only the cher@@ cht@@ age allowed one to stand .
in the New Year &apos;s eight 18@@ 34 a storm turned the Kir@@ cht@@ age and half rus@@ hed .
&quot; to prevent a mis@@ fortune , the tower was abandoned . &quot;
only today &apos;s existing turbine power remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ en@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em is a successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn the Hil@@ arius plant .
&quot; as organis@@ er we invite friends and sponsors on Sunday , 16 July , to the sixth Seren@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
this is designed by the comb@@ o of the Ke@@ pler G@@ ymnasi@@ ums of Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with the contributions of Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Matte@@ is .
local Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing word .
the program starts at 16.@@ 30 .
admission is starting from 15.@@ 30 PM .
the extinction of the seren@@ ade takes place a trunk in front of the gra@@ ve@@ yard .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organis@@ ers present the fantastic view . &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only on dry weather .
&quot; the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters of the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance for tum@@ our and horns . &quot;
the friends and sponsors feel particularly committed to the home care of their home care , such as Seren@@ ade organizer Walter Martin@@ i . &quot;
association aims to test the approval of angle @-@ makers
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim leaves &quot; &quot; does not see a legal condition for the construction and therefore turned to the Council . &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim ins@@ isted &quot; has prompted Andreas Co@@ unter ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
&quot; the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , because at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal there exists a wind@@ power concentration zone . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration area , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , at the same time , the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind use for the rest of the city . &quot;
der@@ lei zones should prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the town of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind power plant in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , which had not approved the district of Düsseldorf , because of a form of form . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of plan@@ ing legal condition the authorised per@@ ple@@ tion is un@@ lawful and therefore also withdraw , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
current status of things : the City Council once again decided to re @-@ establish the wind@@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a permit from the District government is still pending .
&quot; first : &quot; &quot; in this point , the classification of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines are legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been received since last week in the circle of Vier@@ sen , &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes her to the occasion to examine the matter once again .
&quot; however , they do not expect that the procedure is stopped . &quot;
&quot; with a view on current procedures at the administrative court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express in content with the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; NE@@ W Re , a subsidiary of NE@@ W , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette set up the construction of four on 200 meters high winds . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company had participated in which the city quad@@ rup@@ tible with the owner of about 65 hectares of large territory . &quot;
&quot; with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity demand of around 11 400 households can be covered - that corresponds to approximately one @-@ fifth of all four @-@ four households . &quot;
the NE@@ W Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer Lucerne City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen and a stake in a wind plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor cras@@ hes together : Frau dies in a de@@ terr@@ ent accident
an aw@@ ful traffic accident took place on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman was fatal to this .
two other people were slightly wounded .
the Landes@@ straße remained locked for over hours .
&quot; according to police statements , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman went from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her car in the context of accompanying travel with her 53 @-@ year mother as a companion , the L 3@@ 33 in direction of Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and dealers plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bath Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ k and people from the region are to re @-@ discover the shopping facilities in the city center in September .
the wareh@@ ouses and the city government want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the residents to the city centre .
&quot; as the chairman of the commercial one , Christian King , announced the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend , the customer shall sensi@@ tise the customers what offers the own city off the usual supermarket @-@ commodity . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore a market with regional vendors , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their training places . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite you to the &quot; &quot; M@@ It@@ ter@@ night @-@ Shopp@@ en &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the action is not only on residents of the city and the closer region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the Ak@@ tions weekend , says Christian King . &quot;
city administration and commercial enterprises cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce .
&quot; this makes the commercial one and the city into another stage of the project &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; Ak@@ tiv Day &quot; &quot; to Brun@@ nen@@ fest and sell @-@ made Sunday , discussions with all business operators and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and the ren@@ unciation of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials should be re@@ developed new or again . &quot;
includes cour@@ ers and tourists .
&quot; however , many locals would have lost the city center when shopping from the view . &quot;
&quot; in the end , all of them should help to revi@@ ve the inner city - to the landlords , the factories of the whole city and associations . &quot;
&quot; it worked , with a network of overcoming the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y , who have spread themselves partly , had king in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , leader of the I@@ HK Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , divided into the nationwide third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , for the first time , five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ p@@ ago@@ da . &quot;
&quot; the Day was to promote the appreciation of local commerce and make it stronger for the common good of our cities , &quot;
the action under the Feder@@ er of the I@@ HK and with many partners also clearly states that every citizen can influence its direct surroundings itself .
two dead and several wounded after explosion at US school
during construction it came to a gas explosion in the school building .
new other people have been injured .
&quot; in a gas explosion in the US city Minneapolis , two people have been killed and nine others have been wounded , some of them are heavy . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire@@ fighters , on Wednesday ( local time ) was still a hur@@ t@@ ess in critical state . &quot;
a man died when part of a school building falls into an explosion .
&quot; first , a first missed later was also dead . &quot;
in the dead it was the employees of the school .
&quot; as un@@ happy , the authorities affir@@ med works on a gas direction . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the holiday season , only few people spent in the building of the Minne@@ ha@@ ha Academy . &quot;
tr@@ ump sat down after dra@@ fted tran@@ scription by phone calls Mexico under pressure due to payment of the border wall
tran@@ scrip@@ ting of phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and Per@@ sp@@ ans from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27th , Tr@@ ump called on a phone at the Mexican president Enri@@ que Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to , to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US President caught him because he had refused to publicly denoun@@ ced the wall . according to him , he said to him , &quot; &quot; this can not tell you the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and sw@@ am , Mexico to pay for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scrip@@ tions of his first appeal with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a tense replacement .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Succ@@ ess , that a trade for the USA refugees who emigr@@ ated to Australia , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; and &quot; stupid , &quot; &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and that the existence of the Obama has been conve@@ yed to look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; once he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call , after he had said Mr. Succ@@ ess , &quot; this is the most pleasing call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ massacre : activists conduct rac@@ ist mo@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury was driven by a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and p@@ umped to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge , a group of white men came forward with tissues to block its path . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a man middle aged in a con@@ fer@@ ous strip - took a long train at its ci@@ gar and looked after the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; brood the man .
&quot; Ho@@ l him out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; cri@@ es out the silence , as a young black man was sm@@ ashed away from the passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately this horrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is just a post @-@ position . &quot;
&quot; but if then a loop is thrown around the neck from &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all in the audience very real si@@ gh . &quot;
since 2005 Citiz@@ enship on the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to em@@ ulate the night in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody was ever charged with murder .
&quot; it is truly indisp@@ utable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; said T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks , who helps in the organization of delivery . &quot;
&quot; it is a pl@@ aster on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old Congress of Congress Georgia and a lifetime of civil rights .
it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the mon@@ ro@@ e community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; we want to dispute , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to receive justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
a judicial physician puts a beg@@ gar@@ ment over the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI , which received from the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding graph@@ ites were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch process . &quot;
but no one has ever been charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot for decades , say citizens , that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice best@@ owed favor of the black citizens in Georgia for the first time , at the fore@@ gut in the summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the election st@@ ah according to the subject of the F@@ BI of the black Far@@ mp@@ ner Roger Mal@@ com a white landlord , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ our in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy , and that the baby that she bore , not by her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white country owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when they were then away from the prison , and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge came closer , around a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison who has been prepared and arranged the Mor@@ de , concludes with a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a compromise between state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in the murder of the murder , and di@@ pped the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks formulated it even more sump@@ tuous .
&quot; it was a electoral trial , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and if you vote then you will happen here .
&quot; for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene led the annual delivery of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is vivid , po@@ ign@@ ant and is based in a sort of deep racism that many believe in America is no longer exists . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ x , because we are confronted with their u@@ gl@@ iness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest of the Black - into a room and lu@@ sion@@ ed a well played overview of the piece started . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ es Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of chief clan member since years , but he said that the role will never become easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to get this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room , the actors D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , play the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester , and pus@@ hes it , fur@@ ious , that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n -- He , disappeared from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona acc@@ esses the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene battle at the lau@@ test .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ki@@ cking . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t believe that white people at that time &apos; n --- he &apos; said &apos; .
&quot; but &quot; &quot; wit@@ ched one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you only need to meet the hard &quot; &quot; R. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and the energy in space shifts , a feeling of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie will replace the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy doing this correctly , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins once again .
&quot; this time Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ Word , he says it sharp and with pressure . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there is cry , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman cloth@@ ed with a funeral dress , stands on the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads to Bil@@ lie holidays stun@@ ned lob@@ ster &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it there was a group of about four dozen spectators sweat and tears from the eyes .
the public is almost even@@ ly divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come down only the road . &quot;
they experienced every eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as op@@ pressive moisture as Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point , the Mor@@ de have stayed a anec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you find on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de have been found , the air feels penetr@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to get closer and insp@@ ected the cor@@ pse . &quot;
children ho@@ cken at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ pering to each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ mu@@ red a little boy , as he wants to remember it . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene ow@@ es the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch sei@@ l away and wi@@ pe their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh the man in the suit who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona um@@ ar@@ mt two of his fellow @-@ players and then breaks in their arms crying along with the emotional load of the performance and finally breaks through it .
&quot; it is okay , whis@@ pers one of women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did that for a reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience deals with the actors for dinner together . &quot;
&quot; at a table , a white pair from Atlanta ates a white couple from Atlanta excited about the post @-@ position with a black couple that she had just met . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ ski fought to find words which has left the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like yourself and doing that because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ x is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; today the only police @-@ shooting is called . &quot;
in the same room T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks Hof at his table he has e@@ ats and reminds us of the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the post @-@ position is inspiring in a certain way , because it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , whoever does not know his own story is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth
&quot; also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ or@@ f puts on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of gigantic , six @-@ story scenery . &quot;
&quot; the turn@@ stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows op@@ tionally a s@@ hab@@ by street corner with a wall @-@ rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; Pla@@ est and Ela@@ ste &quot; &quot; logo from GDR @-@ Zeiten or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before it parked an open Mercedes @-@ classic car , in which the Rhein@@ h@@ chter posi@@ ums as rock erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively a I@@ setta . &quot;
&quot; typ@@ ed oil cas@@ ks remember Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - which moves through his &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; staging . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ h@@ ers - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ isi@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
&quot; they dec@@ eive Sieg@@ fried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , cr@@ ush in Hollywood Man@@ ier in the trunk and enter the Kra@@ w@@ allo @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the marvel@@ ously fi@@ eses shar@@ ks that surrounds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iled Sieg@@ fried .
later also has to believe in Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong applause .
&quot; stor@@ my is the Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who de@@ ple@@ ted himself and the hands to Merkel @-@ smokers . &quot;
large applause are available for the Festival of Fest@@ spiel@@ chester which shows itself for the first time on stage - given the great heat back into empty leisure clothing .
the performance of Frank Cast@@ or@@ f and his govern@@ ors were expected with tension .
&quot; in 2013 he had to let go a ri@@ f@@ end concert with him in 2013 , there were five years later , in which the &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; desc@@ endant went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Kath@@ arina Wagner is likely to have been happy about this .
&quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ or@@ f , but it was also an understanding of this view . &quot;
I draw a positive Res@@ um@@ é .
Max crowd works as a volunteer
they work in their Volun@@ te@@ er Year right at several places .
where everywhere ?
&quot; lot : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture store , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have already worked at school in the open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum which I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
you are now 26 years old .
how does that come ?
lot : I have made Ab@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a building of engineering studies , let us say successfully . &quot;
&quot; I realized that it is the Fal@@ se , and I want to do something else to work with people . &quot;
and then I asked myself what you do .
&quot; a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point , maybe , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social welfare in winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual @-@ study , probably do a social job training and studies at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne . &quot;
is it not uncommon to have several different locations during the Volun@@ te@@ er ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
probably always it comes to where one makes his FS@@ J .
you can make it from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partially in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me it was exactly the right thing that has mat@@ ured me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs .
unlike in civil engineering studies ?
&quot; quantity : well clear , here it is not about to reck@@ on st@@ atics . &quot;
one always has other people in mind that have a completely different story behind them .
&quot; whether a refugee , if a teen@@ ager , who has been caught up from the family - you always have to go on it individually . &quot;

&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will cut more 3,000 jobs and cut off their intermediate dividend by 72 percent as another restructuring programme will be started to overcome the pressure with which the company is facing . &quot;
&quot; the job creation , announced the Director of John Fall@@ on mostly for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 positions already lost . &quot;
Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost reduction program for a further 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business which was hit by the rapid step to the digital learning .

Kon@@ vo@@ i attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO &apos;s soldier killed in self @-@ ord@@ ant
&quot; a self @-@ ord@@ ship has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , a soldier of Nato , and several others hurt . &quot;
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter have been injured and an explanation of Nato .
&quot; accordingly , local reports died in the incident in the district of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h also three civilians . &quot;
&quot; the bombing of bombing is the last violence that was hit by Afghanistan that month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at . &quot;
on Monday one su@@ icide two people killed near the Iraqi message in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; in an opinion of Nato , it is to happen an explosion on Thursday night , as a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was under impro@@ vis@@ ing explo@@ sives . &quot;
the statement states that all the wounded in a stable state are in a stable state and treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bag@@ ram on the air@@ field Bag@@ ram .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there was at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of which about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
at the end of July a su@@ icide free@@ om@@ be of at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they would have executed this attack .
&quot; on May 31st , an enormous bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city more than 150 people with the killing militant attacks in the country , since the U.S. @-@ led troops in 2001 sup@@ pressed the Taliban from power . &quot;
&quot; the violence under@@ scores the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , since US President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering the number of US troops to support military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the self @-@ attack in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , its policy and especially in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA is paying a decision to delay the smooth@@ y rule by law@@ suits .
&quot; the American Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama , repe@@ aled that the states are obliged to include the smooth@@ es @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 states ens@@ hr@@ ined the agency because of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone @-@ regulations 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the commitment of the agency to work with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and remember that we respond to our state partners , &quot; said EPA Chief of Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced the intention of EPA in June to set up o@@ zone @-@ regulations in which parts of the country must be measured in order to determine where inc@@ isions are to be made to delay more stringent aviation standards - to delay a year until October 2018 .
&quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , reached on Tuesday , and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to withdraw a broad range of environmental provisions that the former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a broader agenda , which should boost economic growth , according to tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , the efforts have triggered the set@@ back of Democrats and reserves to worry about the effects of larger emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the website of EPA says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; the lung function &quot; &quot; and the breathing symptoms can increase &quot; as for example as@@ thma . &quot;
community wants common room
&quot; in the end , the decision was clearly : in two contra@@ indications the com@@ der@@ ate of Flu@@ orn turns into the establishment of a communal space in the future senior residence . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement was signed for the still missing piece section , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it is still going to last until now the church community is owned by the church , but there is now no planning of planning for the project by a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion about a common area .
&quot; one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , has offered the community to come . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would be a living area - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters area for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the council is so@@ aked , such a common room not only to be seen as a meeting point for the residents of the former living area , but open into the church . &quot;
&quot; for example , the word &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; made the lap . &quot;
&quot; the decision is made by the provision of funds for the current budget already last autumn , by funding opportunities . &quot;
the construction is in the rehabilitation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common area would be so reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposed classification sees to signal the investor that one wants to throw him in this respect not a bil@@ lets between the legs , finding that both Satt@@ el@@ - and ambient light - which makes the clou@@ dy and the construction of economic power - is possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , so do not mean Wil@@ fred Soh@@ mer , be this supplement . &quot;
when it helps : unanim@@ ous passes through the panel .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings , with which one does not come as right now , do not rest at the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; I am struggling with it . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger speaks for the common room , but absolutely against a municipal participation . &quot;
it is behind it a covered sub@@ net at any high net or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not so , because with the acquisition of the area there is no grant , but will get a real , in doubt , is the counter@@ top . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ner application , proposed for the proposed classification , finds three advocates . &quot;
&quot; so it remains with two objects in the original program , which cap@@ tures Stefan H@@ aller so together : &quot; &quot; when we summar@@ ise the decision , we make a huge step forward to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

to hike in the Har@@ z of Stern
&quot; in Har@@ z , the nationwide first &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; should be created . &quot;
this is planning the association observatory Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary trail in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; come to meet the information of many hard@@ go@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; he connecting nature , science , movement and sports performance . &quot;
the members want to set up on the planned route and inform them about stars and star images .
&quot; during the first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; well @-@ achiev@@ able installations at five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; question of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the boards should be supple@@ mented by internet .
&quot; therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a part in the location of the site . &quot;
also Acces@@ sibility is a criterion .
later the star@@ pf@@ ad train will be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ pf@@ ad the viewers learn a lot of knowledge , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; stated the association . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars could have different colors , or why a star would have more lumin@@ aire than another , even though he is much further away . &quot;
&quot; I will also be conve@@ yed in which constellation can find a chosen star , and when he is best to see . &quot;
&quot; for 2014 , the association has been operating in the city center St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , which is the highest located observatory in Northern Germany . &quot;
the location in the heart of Har@@ z National Park counts according to the Federal Ministry for Natural protection to the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky way and even the Andro@@ meda galaxy are clearly visible with blo@@ ating eye .
in the UNI @-@ city there has been an initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen somewhat similar to the planned star@@ vation - the planet planet .
&quot; starting from Geb@@ har@@ d Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary trail leads up to the Hain@@ berg and the astronom@@ ical observatory - as well as an &quot; &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the st@@ aves with the individual planets - including the Zwerg@@ plan@@ ed dem@@ oted Plu@@ to at the end point - are precisely positioned at the distance and measure of one to two billions .
the earth shr@@ inking so on a bul@@ let of 6.@@ 5 mil@@ lim@@ etres in diameter while the sun is about 70 meters from the sun .
the entire distance of the planet is good four kilometers .
&quot; while the Light is needed from sun to Plu@@ to about eight hours , pedest@@ rians need a good hour to the St@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pedest@@ rians are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next Fi@@ x@@ stern but would still take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , which should be in a collision event in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN @-@ offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ obstruc@@ ted World Bo@@ xing Council , who went down to greet Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko , the World Bo@@ xing organization super @-@ spring champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory over the former four @-@ divisions World Champion Adri@@ en , on Saturday at Show@@ time both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und for Po@@ und List . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; How do you think , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 : 00 on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the pair of photographs passed , Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as , that a potential show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; remembered Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I am asc@@ ended for bronze , but I am not so great . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to go down to light weight .
and he must move on glue &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that require the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko agreed .
&quot; boxes needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; climate question asked if it should be on pay @-@ per view , part of a strategy to arrange Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko with a 135 pound debut in this year , in order to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell in the forum on 23 September . &quot;
&quot; this battle could take place in the Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans were asked for him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and expressed himself out later on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , he treasures Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may possibly take part in his Saturday battle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko held a generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the Trinity Champion from River@@ side is very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... You &apos;re sorry the co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show head@@ set , then boxes . &quot;
&quot; they both said , they could feel the Mom@@ entum , which opened up for their own struggle . &quot;
&quot; this is the fight , which needs to be performed . &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko said : &quot; I was waiting for the top @-@ fighter and that is Mi@@ key .
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after tire leather
&quot; at an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were severely injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver lost a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira against 16 : 30 , shortly before the connecting market , probably after a tyre plat@@ ter may be control over his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the car multip@@ ly to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he transm@@ uted and then lie on the roof in the green strip . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured during the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured service , the A@@ 7 is locked towards north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could pass by the accident location . &quot;
Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; triple chain works better
Andre Hoffmann hopes on 2 : 2 to the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig that the optimization of the def@@ ences in Au@@ e points brings .
&quot; with the first seasonal game , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result , would not have been the two opponents at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge the Trinity should also be optimized further .
and a gate after a fre@@ isto@@ ß want to un@@ veil the Fort@@ ress also no more .
&quot; for the future , it will be that no more than Michael ( R@@ ensing ) turns on the line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better informed according to the experiences in preparation with the triple chain , than with the quadru@@ ple chain . &quot;
&quot; yet I don &apos;t know how we are acting in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is his cause for sure , &quot; because we just have in the three @-@ time chain on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ mann players who can build good &quot; , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; it is a prerequisite , but that we are still better harmon@@ ize and we do not afford to do so many mis@@ understand@@ ings in building . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but whether one cannot speak after a un@@ decided start from a mis@@ tic start , do not know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the podium , we will certainly speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot;
of that his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; the start into the season assessed I only after six to eight play@@ days , &quot; said Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken down because of a storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can begin the season virtually with a home play , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believes that players from Au@@ e maybe even could be some fresh , since they had no grave and complete play like Fort@@ una against a ascension @-@ fav@@ ored in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 % , where they are currently standing , &quot; says the interior of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland go as an easy favorite on Sunday in the evening ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we take them away , only because we have the claim to come under the first six , &quot; &quot; gl@@ a@@ nonsense , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet at only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games is quite positive . &quot;
&quot; there are no crew in the 2nd Bundesliga you have to strike from before , &quot; explains Fort@@ un@@ as chief . &quot;
&quot; such a statement , would be arrogan@@ t and super@@ fici@@ ally . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday in no case .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ assessment tests published
&quot; the recent findings of testing for asylum seekers in Sweden , have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that over 80 percent of the tested persons older than 18 years are . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for for@@ en@@ sic medicine ( Soviet medic@@ in@@ al@@ bon@@ et ) started with the implementation of tests last year .
&quot; they are to make the assessment of the age in more exact during the asylum process , after the Swedish migration authority ( migr@@ atory bodies ) was critici@@ zed because of errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees . &quot;
&quot; until today , migr@@ ations has been sent to 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person &quot; may be 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are resistant to the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we do not see big difference in statistics of past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high percentage of cases , in which the person has been judged for over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers has over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the patient was 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det the 5@@ 81 results showed that , on the 243 of these cases the person had been open to the person , that it would be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical assessment , in which x @-@ ray recordings of Wis@@ dom and MR@@ I recordings are analyzed , which will then be analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work embr@@ aces the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they went sooner or later than normally through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t believe that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
assessing the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; if we cannot say it certainly , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson impressed by the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult , is low . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in which case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are well ahead .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tons of emphasis was installed at the bridge on the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it works great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold L@@ asi@@ ly , Construction manager at the department of street and traffic in the Govern@@ ors Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began at the same time at all three san@@ atorium bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the building is planned for October , and E@@ asi@@ ly is sure that the schedule is maintained . &quot;
&quot; coming the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the trol@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
it is a v@@ ault bridge from concrete that is ar@@ ra@@ yed with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , it is now over the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure the stability and traffic safety , the three components are now thoroughly re@@ funded . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built in red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10 : 60 meters long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now obtained a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bu@@ sty cap on the north side .
this is a Rand@@ om@@ ination which is also used as audi@@ t@@ weg .
on the southern part of the bridge the bridge is to be inserted on Friday a 2.@@ 20 metre wide range .
it is then to pass on the pedestrian path .
&quot; the special thing is that this is the finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patent @-@ sto@@ ols .
&quot; special finger@@ tips , the wiring of cables by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach requires . &quot;
&quot; because there is also a glass of glass cables connected , to which many companies are connected . &quot;
residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be decreased . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the construction of the building and the gathering in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic track is regulated by a traffic lights . &quot;
for construction work on the Bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher outskirts is the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eving Lin@@ den . &quot;
the cost of the three bracel@@ ets is up to 700 000 Euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest in German potato salad
&quot; it does not happen so frequently that parties involved in a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ for@@ D ) , what else is difficult to get under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the owned parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a wide alliance that shows on this day peaceful flag because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell for the poster &quot; great electoral campa@@ igning &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start brings , how Alice Gau@@ del , which together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leaders of the leaders on the 24th of September , and the Deputy Chairman of Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ for@@ et@@ ters , but to demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful .
&quot; originally the city @-@ picnic was planned under the slogan &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but is now taking place on the parking place below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair of the Forum A World and one of the leading organizers , were really pleased : &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ d without any problems , &quot; says the woman who has given him . &quot;
&quot; the police has be@@ or@@ ate many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly at the station , which is only a few meters from the venues . &quot;
how is the Af@@ ales come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported from the Af@@ D volcano erup@@ tion he tried to make such an event and get the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built @-@ built Laur@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ ch there was not enough parking available . &quot;
&quot; so now the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; with a view of the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does : against 20 o &apos;clock , at the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz , a band provides for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle several speakers , including the Rhine @-@ pf@@ alz @-@ president Uwe Young . &quot;
&quot; in the hall are about 200 list@@ eners , waiting for the leaders of the nom@@ inee for the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice @-@ Presidents Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;

&quot; just over an hour , the Af@@ for@@ event takes place , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is short notice after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can cancel - no special incidents .

both Sol@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have sol@@ opo@@ si@@ ties in European top orches@@ tras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ t is the SW@@ R Symph@@ onic orchestra .
&quot; both unite the desire to cross not only the borders on their instruments , but also merge the boundaries of the different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds with the two as in a new format , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the J@@ azz@@ ech@@ op@@ pers , classical music , jazz and free games to become an intrigu@@ ing or@@ nate work . &quot;
this part of the program was premi@@ ered only this spring with a great success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils Wo@@ wo@@ es wrote it for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher monastery church with its particular acousti@@ cs will be aware of the concert .
Kr@@ isten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ ex@@ ual ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot;
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; So Kr@@ isten Ste@@ wart quite openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ual . &quot;
&quot; when I get dressed in gri@@ lled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh this was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known relationship of the Hol@@ ly@@ e stars was the &quot; t@@ wilight &quot; -@@ colleagues Robert Patt@@ in@@ son , who eventually went bitter . &quot;
&quot; despite all that the brood @-@ nice performer is insured against the &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; magazine , &quot; &quot; I was definitely in love with whom I have done . &quot;
&quot; or do you think about , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kr@@ isten gave her that it bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; &quot; I have always lived with du@@ alism and seriously believed it . &quot;
so it has never been confused or imp@@ lied .
I just never liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them , it suffered loud &quot; Bang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but at school time , when she loved like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girl . &quot;
this really has me very hurt .
&quot; when I was eleven , the kids told me , I would look like a bug . &quot;
I really felt attacked , frightened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now look back and think of me : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
especially the public they don &apos;t like to give her love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and anno@@ yed me .
&quot; and perhaps some call me to be un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like it to justify myself before the whole public . &quot;
the Governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced every evening with a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Governor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today , I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of reflection ... today , I will tell you as a citizen of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic Governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; &quot; Justice added . &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say that it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump spoke a great announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice declared not the Democratic candidate of Hill@@ ary Clinton .
&quot; Justice , according to For@@ bes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes notes that he possesses coal min@@ es in five states , and inherited a coal business from his father . &quot;
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday Thurs@@ days gave an explanation , in which it said , &quot; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would be more likely to work than to work in order to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ors and the control of the least legal entities in history is the announcement of Governor Justice only the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and unable to find a positive , lonely message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ president Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ e lo@@ aves &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing scandal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday , which he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated it is not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics boss Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ nov , during the eve of Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics world Championships , that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that it is determined to fight the dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , I am sorry for &quot; all athletes who were cut off at competitions Gold@@ - and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress for the maintenance of the ban , which was issued in November 2015 , after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) had found references to nation@@ alised dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was today a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e the re@@ porters . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has been aware of itself , that it has experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to make sure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; said Co@@ e , he is also &quot; delighted &quot; that Russia accept the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been achieved but the Congress supports the Task Force &apos;s recommendations that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added : &quot;
&quot; nine Russian athletes are starting at the athle@@ tics world championship , which begin on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; dro@@ wning tests are still inadequate , and har@@ b@@ inger was still working freely , he said Re@@ porters in London to a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
O@@ bit@@ u@@ aries for in Mali gra@@ ded soldiers
&quot; at a funeral celebration at the north@@ h@@ ess@@ ischen Frit@@ z@@ lar , approximately 1000 people of the two are thought of a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precautions .
at the still un@@ resolved failure of the Defense Minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
&quot; it recorded the two up@@ side pilots , but as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their trade . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we tend to be at this highest victim , which they have produced in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; stated she . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old staff from Nord@@ h@@ essen were killed on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
&quot; her followers were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a Tot@@ en@@ gen@@ der of the Bundes@@ wehr , in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ der Cathedral St. Peter . &quot;
at noon we took only the relatives in the church farewell .
&quot; after that , the funeral party began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot;
these were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General Manager of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; trau@@ ma laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm with arm to the sack . &quot;
in front of the church Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ es and numerous soldiers per@@ secuted the ceremony on a canvas .
defensive Minister of Le@@ yen made the reverse soldiers decorated as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and sat@@ anic .
the Staff sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann has built up the aviation operation of the Fi@@ f@@ itter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tigers of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the Reg@@ iment , to which the soldiers belong , stated : &quot; if this occupation could not turn the crash , it would not have failed . &quot;
&quot; doubts at the UN mission in Mali , Minister of Le@@ yen did not show : the use is dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but he is also of high importance for a country , from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral feast the soles were brought from the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they were buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any information . &quot;
Prinz Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish queen of Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by his wife . &quot;
he shared the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish kingdom of Ros@@ kil@@ de is being set in the cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard already made a sar@@ cop@@ ha@@ g for the two .
&quot; the queen was in agreement with the decision of her husband , &quot; &quot; says it further in the communication . &quot;
where Prinz Hen@@ rik was buried , be not yet unclear . &quot;
&quot; however , he did not have the intention of being set in his French homeland . &quot;
Prinz Hen@@ rik never had such a meal that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have become king .
&quot; in 2016 he went to retirement , and also sets the title &quot; Prin@@ c@@ hl . &quot; &quot;
&quot; because Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted , he does not see himself as equal to his wife - also not after death , declared &quot; &quot; Lev@@ ant Ballet , &quot; chief of the Danish royal house . &quot;
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year will eventually be unclear is still unclear .
&quot; but he did not have the intention of being set in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French Adel@@ s@@ ame , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
he worked on the Thames in the French Embassy .
&quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people had always been at@@ oned , prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand at his almost 50 years of rain . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography of Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did , critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk ings instead of kn@@ itting , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Vol@@ vo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and had the reputation to be the reputation of soci@@ o@@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants swift re@@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; the Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green ruling majority for a swift re@@ election of the country &apos;s day , but he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; then , on Friday , for the dissolution of the Parliament , he said . &quot;
&quot; previously , the surprising resignation of a Green MEPs from their country @-@ country group in Nieder@@ sachsen had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a severe crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the country @-@ elections , the red @-@ green coalition lost its scarce one @-@ vote majority in the Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the old Green MP El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ be@@ et established their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election of 2018 in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U frei@@ ghter Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his group to take them up .
&quot; the CD@@ U and F@@ DP have had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship was the other way round .
the new country day is elected regular on 14 January next year .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green national government must now decide whether they could rule in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , it is essential for an indispensable that the country day follows its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible . &quot;
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
&quot; the language version also provides the possibility to trust the trust of the prime minister , and chooses a successor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these opportunities must be legally checked , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; we will discuss all questions in peace , if they are legally checked . &quot;
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ wes@@ terly step &quot; &quot; however something cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot;
I feel very well . &quot;
it turned out as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Greens demanded the vice @-@ hour members to return their coun@@ tdown .
&quot; of course , we assume that they received their Land@@ sc@@ and@@ at that has received their country on the green state list , with immediate effect , distributed the governor Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
the Group Leader of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets . &quot;
they have chosen to be aware of no pron@@ unciation in the faction .
&quot; even before the background , that there were no content differences , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot;
SPD @-@ chan@@ cell@@ or Martin Schulz condemned the crossing of the German @-@ Sax@@ on Green El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Greens in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the Federal President of the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly choose the country day .
&quot; the leaving T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony , the majority . &quot;
&quot; the policy leader &quot; &quot; in their last van@@ ity and in their fr@@ ust her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; critici@@ zed SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot;
&quot; it is a scandal that the CD@@ U in Nieder@@ sachsen im@@ penetr@@ ates this dirty in@@ play game , trying to beat out of it political capital . &quot;
Nieder@@ sach@@ et CD@@ U frac@@ tion@@ er Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his Members to record El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets into the CD@@ U .
&quot; the Leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw the jack@@ ets , with personal career di@@ stract the result of the Sunday elections 2013 . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was the strongest strength , SPD and Greens then had a hau@@ ghty majority of one voice in the country before the SPD . &quot;
&quot; agricultural Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ ves , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany talks about contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect yourself .
agricultural Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt : how can consumers protect themselves from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer consumers to look carefully and check the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; at the consumer &apos;s consumer portal www.@@ dr@@ war@@ dness .de , the federal states provide the latest information about the eggs of the eggs . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; also , if after all we know at the moment , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded . &quot;
now Al@@ di the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs are out of the offer - because the central role of the education of the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
food surveillance is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately un@@ locked up , and it has been in close exchange with the authorities of Germany in the close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all the information and the risk assessment are available for consumers .
&quot; the trade has the same as the makers to wear , that the selling products are traffic @-@ capable and health @-@ harmless . &quot;
&quot; if at eggs of the resi@@ dual amount of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not traffic @-@ capable . &quot;
un@@ contaminated eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time not the farms to blame .
sitting production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
after a state @-@ of @-@ knowledge the production companies does not meet immediate fault .
&quot; rather , they must reck@@ on due to mut@@ in@@ compar@@ ably illegal practices of service companies with economic damages . &quot;
as always there are too little controversi@@ es at harvest .
is there only the personnel or even at the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
&quot; however , there were just the official controls that have revealed the process . &quot;
&quot; in the truth , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; this is why a consistent education of such events and the hand@@ over to the pro@@ secut@@ ors in the cases , in which crimes can occur , are of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already seen many times that I acquired an incomplete explanation by the responsible authorities .
is the regular alar@@ mis@@ m in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and non @-@ priced foods .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ tici@@ de is used in the food industry , consumers and consumers are rightly outra@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; due to the pan@@ demic use , manufacturers , traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ tici@@ des Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food delivered animals is not acceptable and must be completed immediately . &quot;
it must be consistent on all levels and worked with high pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all the competent authorities , that the expert is swiftly and incomplete . &quot;
how to impact the rules of the foot on Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
&quot; the rules , which aim to avoid un@@ restricted issues of the European soccer football , will not distur@@ b Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s world cup transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will take place for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A , because the leading organisation that supervis@@ es the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , which have been launched by the UEF@@ A in 2011 means that PS@@ G must eventually prove that the transfer from Ne@@ ym@@ ar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million ) , to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can certainly make the money easy , so Ne@@ ym@@ ar sub@@ ordin@@ ates and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team through the rich history of Qatar by Qatar . &quot;
&quot; associations may take a lot of money for the purchase of players , but they must be checked with legitimate supply sources , which allow them to ste@@ ak the break @-@ even point in their field of football business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election at UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French players believed that associations , who had taken tremendous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ki@@ ed to ruin , if banks or owners returned their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P passed from concentration on the debt of clubs on the monitoring of their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel demo@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch was originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then strongly invested to build the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher task . &quot;
&quot; during the current triple @-@ period period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses in the amount of € 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini 2015 has fallen from the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A @-@ successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to avoid excessive expenses . &quot;
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so that is responsible at UEF@@ A for FF@@ P and compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause from Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a package , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing on the duration of his contract . &quot;
&quot; Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a five @-@ year agreement , so that the resolution can be transferred to € 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million for the next five years . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P @-@ sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most serious sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a number of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later was lowered to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members earn for the Champions League of season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of normal 25 players . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to over@@ list their financial supervision by blowing their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club .
&quot; while a Catalan company could spontaneous the PS@@ G if the value of the sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not leave this as a legitimate income . &quot;
exactly this happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ing of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it has been reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar will come across payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup in Qatar .
&quot; however , PS@@ G and Qatar have denied that Ne@@ ym@@ ar WC ambassador will be and a such maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators simply could find out . &quot;
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G means that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to consider any attempt to handle the rules .
&quot; UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s transfer , sag@@ ging on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
&quot; the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of EUR 54@@ 2.2 million , a profit of more than 10 million euros . &quot;
accounts for the last fiscal year must be published .
PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for Sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and trim sales . &quot;
the association will assume that sales after the signing by at least 30 percent will rise .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s way@@ ward by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; finance dop@@ ing &quot; with the Club and the State , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish Daily AS in terms of cat@@ astrop@@ hic ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a State , which financed a society . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football during the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financing of Fair@@ play , because one can take different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is in search of a new shock supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y @-@ chocolate was made for Swiss Life .
now the heads of collaboration is in front of a possible end : the airline is writing the contract new .
&quot; Swiss Life spokes@@ man Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request from the news agency SD@@ A , a corresponding report on the newspaper &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; according to current planning , the Air@@ line will launch a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
&quot; around 17 million small rot@@ st packaged sho@@ ots into 14 grams per year , will distribute the passengers before landing at the passengers . &quot;
the Swiss has no information about the costs .
&quot; the company in@@ sider value the order volume according to &quot; North @-@ Switzerland &quot; to 1,5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros daughter achieves an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is always the advertising effect : for a shock maker it is a prestigious order .
&quot; as many applicants , there is a new tender , the Swiss does not want to betra@@ y . &quot;
but in question only Swiss manufacturers come .
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to seek a renewal of the Treaty on Spring 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the SD@@ A , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not accessible for an opinion . &quot;
chocolate bars are spread over the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
&quot; before Swiss a contract concluded with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has been building with Hu@@ g &apos;s chocolate tablets . &quot;
the possibility to place the logo has conducted Swiss before two and a half years with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; on the long @-@ haul flights , customers of the First Class with treats from the Con@@ fis@@ ery Fi@@ gli will be pampered , in Business Class nas@@ ties passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i from Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
&quot; on the short route , Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i is distributed by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and economy class . &quot;

&quot; first day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a promising vegetable that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; going back at the core of the G@@ ags - actor @-@ middle age play gre@@ le children , who will grow up - they still managed to gain the im@@ possibility of winning the last part of the jo@@ z . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who are now playing adults is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the casting principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ he years as &quot; The Hand of Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The Hand , which the cradle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at one point st@@ ö@@ bert a character by an Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the gracious c@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ker ) , now Roman@@ tic , has K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ e@@ au ) still not forgotten . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another crazy @-@ mal@@ ign@@ ant plot , in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ drawn impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
as always the Ex@@ cep@@ ts are the best part of the franchise .
&quot; it is particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ illons from &quot; singles &quot; shows , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; these are the moments of random madness , which could take this franchise : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the gang that the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; will be seen . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; at Amazon meanwhile reminds on a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic B@@ lon@@ de &quot; and even an &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East against @-@ West Ring@@ battle I@@ kon@@ ography . &quot;

the main wheels - a hard sc@@ ot@@ ten@@ er Gregor and an ide@@ alistic Io@@ sef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogs of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a comprehensive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt can be synchron@@ ized in English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
&quot; there are some nice g@@ ags for watching ( the police spend the time watching chess on television , how Americans might do it with football ) . &quot;
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ fty Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is involved so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a des@@ perate propaganda - a mur@@ derer , who carries a Re@@ agan mask , is involved - that it is often as a single playing . &quot;
&quot; with six long episodes , it draws up , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , which has been re@@ trac@@ ted to a lower length , could provide its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and Io@@ z@@ sef always visit the American Embassy , whose lobby has always occupied by two big men that have a pile of bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the da@@ ined communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for the for@@ age for a success .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creator were not wrong : we even do it with our own recent history and theirs .
blow against drugs @-@ Mafia in the country
the police have succeeded in a strike against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were inv@@ aded , as the Pro@@ secutor Kon@@ stanz on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , 15 accus@@ ations were arrested in the age of 25 and 77 years and have passed the arrest warrant against this . &quot;
&quot; the officials put greater amounts marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , be@@ ech weapons , as well as several hundred thousand Euros . &quot;
at the same swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Italians there was German Ar@@ rest War@@ rant .
therefore the two will probably be delivered to Germany .
in the action Italian and Bav@@ arian investig@@ ators were involved .
&quot; in total , more than 300 poli@@ c@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Mafia will be organized drug criminal , heavy violence , attempted murder , as well as rob@@ bery and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; already since summer 2016 , the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Office was established against the organized drug trade in the South German region . &quot;
&quot; between the pro@@ secut@@ ors in Constance and Palermo , a patho@@ gen and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the wholesale market was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the vision of the investigations , especially Italian citizenship with the relation to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; a incident on 27 May in Hü@@ ab , where several shots were fired at the morning at the early morning , is likely to go to the bank account . &quot;
how big gaps in the foreig@@ ner register
&quot; data from citizens who should not appear . &quot; &quot; according to a report , the foreig@@ ner tab shows significant shortcomings in Germany . &quot;
this lead to partly severe failures in asylum procedures .
&quot; the assessment for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jur@@ gen , has made attention to a media report , according to major gaps in the country @-@ centric register . &quot;
&quot; defects in the registered recorded data could lead in asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations , in an analysis , in an analysis that is presented to the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the Register , the information is estimated to collect ten million people with foreign citizenship , including about 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU states . &quot;
the data will therefore be managed by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany .
&quot; because the data were not sufficiently maintained , the data quality has not been well kept in parts so far . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases the data were found by 1921 , &quot; of people who have long ceased to live in life or by citizens who have become German citizens and actually no longer arise in the register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data en@@ cor@@ es can substantially dec@@ eler@@ ate processes , &quot; it says the report . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics about travelling people , the EU citizen must be captured , which would not even have to travel . &quot;
&quot; but such false states led to a distorted debate on how to deal with patients &quot; , &quot; it is therefore said in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the federal government has begun to return to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children , if they have travelled from there . &quot;
&quot; this will emerge from an internal paper by the Federal Ministry for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) , the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ re newspaper &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper , the BAM@@ F lead such proceedings &quot; concerning families with children - except infants and infants - according to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper with reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; following the Dublin agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach it first . &quot;
&quot; if a migration travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the travelling country . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the office is now writing : &quot; in the meantime , the recording capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy is considerably enhanced . &quot;
Italy returned to the reception and accommodation of families guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) hold these commitments for sufficient .
other EU states would also send you back to Dublin as part of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the official political speakers in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children dro@@ w because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system of un@@ lawful admission conditions and a haz@@ ard to cinema . &quot;
second result achieved
&quot; a total of 220 liters of blood from in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living persons , the bleeding service has already provided for other people . &quot;
&quot; at least by the twelve citizens , who were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , which has now distributed over 100 lit@@ res of blood in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the community traditionally appreci@@ ates the community at the session of the council the multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our body is laid out for it and we respect the donations that provide their blood for strangers , nor for this un@@ selfish , &quot; underlined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood don@@ ating helps several people , &quot; explained the county manager of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the preser@@ v@@ ae are broken into its components . &quot;
&quot; in this way , three people could benefit from a bleeding . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported from the actions that are carried out in spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ators , &quot; said the DR@@ K @-@ district manager . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre have led to higher participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a re@@ beer to the multi @-@ dres@@ sers and were awarded for each 50 @-@ made bleeding . &quot;

the Bank of England will keep interest rates of 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to be announced later that the interest rates will remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation took over an increase . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; will remain &quot; &quot; when they retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a strengthened pressure . &quot;
&quot; the policy makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 for holding interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % , whereas in this month less members decreased a rise , since the weak economic growth has been weak@@ ened for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and warned that pressure should continue on household income , whereby inflation in autumn is likely to rise to almost 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but it sign@@ alized that over the next few years , Z@@ inser@@ ts would be necessary to breed the Bre@@ xit of Bre@@ xit , and she said that the credit costs may increase more than expected on the financial markets . &quot;
the members also voted to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut &apos;s Business package that was issued prior to the Bre@@ xit after a year ago .
&quot; it will demand time for finance plan to market financial resources for banks as soon as it is expected , that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak as the pressure on the real@@ income of households continues to be charged to consumption . &quot;
&quot; at the interest rates it repeated that &quot; a certain imp@@ unity of monetary policy &quot; to the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; slightly greater &quot; &quot; would be required than markets . &quot;
the markets currently forecast the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank stressed that proceeds would be &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the growth forecasts for this and next year are projected compared with the 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the projected growth forecasts for this and next year .
it has maintained its growth forecasts for 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appoint growth will have to rise up the increasing expectations on a cell increase , and GDP increased in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.2 % . &quot;
&quot; growth will be expected in the third quarter at 0.3 % , although it will be easy to recover after the Bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the most recent in@@ filtration report offered little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by an increasing inflation and minor salary , as the ti@@ ghtening first is even worse before it is repaired . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy cannot prevent the income in the next few years , but she added that wages are clear to the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , resulting in the weak pounds , which is a part of the lower consumption of consumption . &quot;
the decision follows a year after lowering interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % last August after the shocking EU @-@ voting which caused the sin@@ king of the attack .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will achieve the prices and the economy .
&quot; prior to the last judgment of the Bank to the interest rates , the call has risen to an interest rate , since the inflation had increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July a rise to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has declined from 2,@@ 9 % in June to 2,@@ 6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected and will attract it again in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said the crossing in relation to its aim of 2 % is &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; to a weak pounds . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ ker , said : &quot; in view of the recent withdrawal of the s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , since the len@@ ders want to end strongly to shops and end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly well for those who complete the existing de@@ posit@@ ors and the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) should prescri@@ be the controversial HIV drug 10,000 people &quot;
&quot; from September after a battle against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS access to a &quot; transformed &quot; HIV prevention treatment . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that one prior to the intercourse un@@ recorded pre@@ occupation pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection from high @-@ risks by around 86 percent , now supplied by health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
he agreed to finance the process after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed last year a judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the Pr@@ EP despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance him .
&quot; the chess campaign announced on Thursday by N@@ HS England Chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens was welcomed as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) recorded this as the &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first ones that will allow the registration of people and further clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018 . &quot;
predic@@ tive pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV compounds that are taken prior to sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection with infection .
having to take Pr@@ EP before intercourse means that just enough drugs in the body of a person are available to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs may be taken every day or twice before the intercourse .
&quot; those who come to question are gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners , who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; clinics are identified to suitable participants who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known as well @-@ known as anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and are registered at a house physician can also opt for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by identifying clinical tests , how it is implemented in large scale , implemented and implemented in a large scale . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts for prevention of HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades continuing progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ EP , when it is targeted to needy and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ m@@ ics . &quot;
&quot; from September to people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England , to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not with a negotiation with a partner which leads to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is quickly carried out all over the country and that no one has left a risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , as the Pr@@ EP testing was created , we are on the best way to protect over 10,000 HIV @-@ infected persons . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome by months of delays and hesit@@ ant implementation through the government . &quot;
the evidence show how transforming this drug as a part of our approach to HIV prevention and can finish the transmission of these vital infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; it is now important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will contribute to the ending of the spread of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
the big living lives : mezz@@ anine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , shr@@ unk from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex at Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .
&quot; this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I love me in her and made an offer on this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first viewing , the 1,000 square feet had been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; originally a one @-@ room estate with a da@@ wned layout , you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne &apos;s storage space and a mezz@@ anine to make the generous ceiling height . &quot;
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light . &quot;
&quot; this was my requirement , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , which was 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development but also a place to live for jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms in one another , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezz@@ anine in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to resolve the submission .
&quot; the steel plant is rather complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were over@@ thrown over , without having to wi@@ pe ourselves . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the top or at the bottom . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement allowed it to place Er@@ fan , two rooms in full height - with a lot of extra drama . &quot;
for the mezz@@ anine looks a classic copper window from ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us via the glam@@ orous living area .
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold mo@@ e@@ bel , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illum@@ ination set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
on both ends there is a short corridor mir@@ r@@ ored to let him take longer .
in the kitchen the mir@@ r@@ oring looks like a window into another room .
at the entrance mir@@ r@@ ored units place space for all the bri@@ dle and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; through the perception of a glam@@ orous space , the beauty of living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the st@@ ahl@@ reinforced , vene@@ ered M@@ DF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is very important , so that if you push the door open , very easy to guide . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could win extra 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base , or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a vesti@@ gi@@ al shape , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
&quot; here , they managed to enlarge the floor space while using high quality materials , which gives space to its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and who therefore help create an emotional relationship in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not love yourself into the electric plu@@ gs in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through a good design and increased potential number of square metres in something completely unique .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to not leave this . &quot;
brothers are fighting for a 500 million US dollars
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confrontation because of one of the largest real estate imperial Vict@@ ori@@ as in the value of more than 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors away from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business capacity shall be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp examination of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers spent 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family since 1973 bought a shop in Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood . &quot;
there the family of West@@ co je@@ ans founded and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; according to an agreement with her late father Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominating personality &quot; &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a jurisdiction states that this means that Col@@ in property owns the value of € 3@@ 16 million and Paul in the value of 17@@ 6 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the col@@ on proposed by Col@@ in proposed resolutions have left him with what I kept for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot;
on Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice occurred on the last Friday .
&quot; the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claimed to be excluded . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in argued that this is not true , but he raises Paul before , some possessions and competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hope to teach the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes , that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs rise in the case with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both sides held by law . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her died husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run the milk bars and delic@@ acy stores from the late 1950 @-@ 0s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early seven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood property in the Col@@ in the first je@@ ans the family opened .
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co there when he was &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped her ownership of her children . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me , that he never wanted to land the brethren in court , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , whereby Col@@ in claimed that mark when leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , so Paul &quot; said about the conditions of their financial division . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in has returned very back , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography in 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of television stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say a lot , &quot; because the case in front of the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sorry that my brother Paul decided to complain and drag our family name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father did not want that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot;
trac@@ tions of new staff leader plans to restrict the media @-@ st@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico reported that the new secretary of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including the reports of the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more equ@@ itable course . &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ porter D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Staff of the White House , he met his first day of working with leading employees , he set out a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House that he wants to repair : poor information that has come into the hands of the President . &quot;
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in writing - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information .
&quot; wa@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to umer@@ ate Tr@@ ump by monitoring its media freedom . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ umps relationship to television reaches decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV broad@@ casts is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was upset because of an unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of places that were to convince , &quot; said the former Elec@@ toral advis@@ er Sam Nun@@ berg in February to Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key , Tr@@ umps Twitter habit is under control , according to six former presidential election officers , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that tr@@ umps Twitter habit have ever &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; is ridiculous . &quot;
perhaps these struggle officers know something we don &apos;t know - that Tr@@ umps T@@ we@@ ets must have included even more ig@@ ni@@ tion without their interventions .
we will probably never learn something about the twe@@ ets which Tr@@ ump will not be sent .
&quot; if his staff made it a few times to hold troubles from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; however , no one has consistently able to prevent that tr@@ ump controversy . &quot;
&quot; a part of the problem is that people in a white house , composed of competing parties , always try to further their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material , which may promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; the Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the fon@@ dness of the Consult@@ ant , to bring out the President out of the strategic reasons without any doubt . &quot;
this was an example that was described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say that tr@@ ump can react as a volcano on negative press sections , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he will find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; this happened at the end of February , when someone gave to the President &apos;s reluc@@ t@@ antly a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy rod in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a pile to be of le@@ aks in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was ban@@ ished because of gun permanently from Twitter or that he has offered no concrete evidence , or that he vo@@ ke the false accus@@ ations in the past and vo@@ ke it . &quot;
tr@@ ump read the article and started to ask employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; added Gold@@ maker , added to the then Staff , Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the Tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that happen ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove more effective as Pri@@ eb@@ us as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence . &quot;
this imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Me@@ ist@@ requested criminals get post by Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the help of the people is praying and hoped . &quot;
the police in all of Europe will be ma@@ iled this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminal on the run .
&quot; since the addresses of the sought @-@ bur@@ gers are not well @-@ known , are indications of the population hoped and pray . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol will follow Friday from the action , which follows the &quot; &quot; Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; calendar from winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences could have shown that many fle@@ eting of vacation destinations , called the part of the Euro@@ pol . &quot;
you have compiled 21 post@@ cards for selected criminals from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online hym@@ ns could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire @-@ series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some compensated travelers on the war of war , who have negotiated one of the congregation to return to a field in front of their men &apos;s houses . &quot;
the travelers have parked their 20 caravan across a field outside a prosperous street of Soli@@ h@@ ull which is called the &quot; million@@ aires series . &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters , after they have been thrown out only in May without being deter@@ red by one of the Council from excav@@ ated dit@@ ch to prevent their accidents . &quot;
the tactical group found a gap in the defense posts and op@@ pressing their vehicles by a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; the inhabitants of Soli@@ h@@ ull have pushed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous residents said , &quot; They were sent there on Monday night , after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pas@@ sers . &quot;
&quot; the Council needs to be forced by shame to implement , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , they were moved and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to handle it , by keeping long walks in order to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I am not happy , continue to pay my coun@@ tenance , if the Council may not stop it once . &quot;
&quot; one people who didn &apos;t want to be called : &quot; it is ridiculous , we just saw the last round of these travelers to be lo@@ oted only by another round . &quot;
&quot; this time , the numbers have increased and you have seen even a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person at the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an unauthorized camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to proceed as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to support our migration collection , it is very important that as many people have a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check , when we present our case . &quot;
from bir@@ hof will Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former hotel bir@@ hof will the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
&quot; the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated , and will be re @-@ opened on the 1st of March next year . &quot;
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closing of the hotel bir@@ hof by the then ambience factory company mbH to 13 April 2014 , approximately 30 000 nights were lost per year and also revenue by the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in autumn 2014 , given dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who arrived in the County , the hotel building offered as a collective accommodation , what was controversial for controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers through the installation of a building plan in order to secure the area as a hotel location .
at that time the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time .
&quot; but above all Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Ober@@ citizenship Julian O@@ ss@@ wald , the hotel location defended and spoke back then by serious interested parties in the house . &quot;
he should be right .
&quot; the group of Lu@@ isen@@ hotels with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former hotel bir@@ hof in Berlin , and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you are hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the previous Hotel bir@@ hof have already been in front of the entrance for a longer period of construction , and when one enters the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation work will be made . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils were cut out , blankets to part di@@ re , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the black style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large @-@ built showers , the entrance area will be re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; everything was later &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois close &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expressed . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry , &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to position on the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , stressed . &quot;
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its about 60 rooms want to set up on a broad scale .
&quot; individual holiday@@ makers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause he already led so Sch@@ eme .
the ideas of the city are identical to those of the Hotel @-@ Group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants not to set itself exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under a million euros , he counts . &quot;
&quot; the exterior plants are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard building a large terrace comes from the restaurant , which is publicly available . &quot;
&quot; Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic , &quot; &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : us @-@ Special sets Grand Jury a
&quot; in Russia &apos;s affair at US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; the committee recorded the work in the past few weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; under appeal to the familiar persons . &quot;
the newspaper compl@@ ained the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensified his investigations .
the sender CN@@ N reported it already give first pre @-@ dischar@@ ges of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between the el@@ dest son and a Russian Ombud@@ sper@@ son .
U.S. intelligence services acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time to be specifically mixed to the presidential election in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller examines if there were differences between trac@@ umps and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigation , several men are to stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the re@@ public@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller took more and more tr@@ umps private and business environment under the magni@@ fier . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Washington Post , &quot; wrote some weeks ago that the special kno@@ b Tr@@ ump went into the center and look for the accus@@ ation , whether the president may hin@@ ders the judiciary in the course of the affair . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine this evidence in possible failure , and decide whether the charges shall be raised . &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys will therefore also be called Pro@@ chambers .
mostly they are switched on when it is about larger and controversial cases .
the procedure always takes place behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be switched on by pro@@ secutor &apos;s office to invite people to con@@ ges@@ tion under E@@ id .
&quot; according to the sender CN@@ N , pre @-@ dischar@@ ges were already exhibited , which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
individuals who were involved in the meeting were asked to a statement made it in the report .
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ umps advis@@ er and in @-@ law son J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his dam@@ al election chief Paul Man@@ a@@ fort at the conversation .
&quot; right @-@ wing experts said on Thursday morning on Thursday TV , that the de@@ composition show that mu@@ eller cannot be timi@@ d in his work and that he should be necessary if it should be necessary to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it would not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on to decide over the survey of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the suspension of the body at the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the president used on Thursday morning a speech in West Virginia to present Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign of political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia @-@ story is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the topic give the Democrats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about them . &quot;
&quot; his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in an opinion , he wis@@ ely nothing of the establishment of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but this also usually work in secret , stres@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; the White House endor@@ se all measures , which accelerated the work of the special agent in &quot; fair &quot; manner . &quot;
the former F@@ BI boss James Com@@ ey said three times that not against the president .
&quot; I have no reason to accept that something changed in this , it says in the explanation . &quot;
&quot; but Mu@@ eller had only been used , after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had been fired . &quot;
&quot; because of this re@@ pro@@ ver@@ tions , accus@@ ations had turned down against tr@@ ump , he has to im@@ pe@@ de the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to raise an investigation of the investigation against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is under great pressure due to the investigation .
&quot; according to the representation of U.S. media , the White House gathered material against the special medium and its employees . &quot;
the dissolved spec@@ ulations about whether tr@@ ump mu@@ eller is dischar@@ ged .
&quot; unlike any of an independent special congress of Congress such as the President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which it could theoretically be fired at the ur@@ ging of the President from the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
but several sen@@ ators of both parties want to for@@ bow such a step .
&quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented on Thursday to be released on Thursday , after which the special chan@@ cell@@ or could no longer be released . &quot;
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg is driving in the Antar@@ ctic
in the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ ctic a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has solved itself from the scarce size of Berlin from the Shel@@ f .
he divided the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar@@ - and marine research on Wednesday .
&quot; the more than one tri@@ l@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square @-@ kilometre big mu@@ gs are now driving north and will probably be two , three years until it mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the largest ic@@ eber@@ gs that researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
a threat to people does not go out from him .
&quot; to what extent climate change has played a role in the interruption of the ice ges , according to research data is unclear . &quot;
&quot; however , in total , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s of ice boots in the region , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact background . &quot;
according to many researchers that could be combined with the heating of heating .
the crum@@ b c@@ ab has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Shel@@ f swi@@ ms at the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow to the sea and breaks out regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ spring is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula .
north of this skir@@ t was the balance of wax and vom@@ iting a few years ago .
&quot; a full shot is there , writes AW@@ I research scientist Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot to do that even the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ spring is in danger , as the front @-@ edge se@@ ams have never been withdrawn as far as currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice @-@ plate can stand among tension and can fall , in case of a key@@ note one piece . &quot;
&quot; the melting of sh@@ el@@ fe@@ is and ic@@ e@@ berg increases the sea level not , since they swim in the water swimming and ice so much water as it results after the melting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the spring process leads to that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in the low extent , the British research project on observation of the Antar@@ c@@ tica ( MID@@ AS ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ spring is according to AW@@ I data with nearly 50 000 square kilometres the fourth largest archipelago of the Antar@@ c@@ tica .
&quot; the transition from the mainland is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks out regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and we have no direct connection to climate change , the ic@@ schild comes now into a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most significant retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; under scientists may be disputed if the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ spring is now going back to grow and possibly combined , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even if this researchers did not withdraw the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg on climate change , so in the past few decades there are very many ic@@ eber@@ gs of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula . &quot;
this long clock in the Antar@@ c@@ tica covers the direction of South America .
according to data by the British Antar@@ ctic Survey the ic@@ ar@@ ctic peninsula of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
&quot; to decline , the temperature has increased . &quot;
the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has over 50 years ago around three degrees warmer and zäh@@ le with it to the areas where the temperature is fastest growing .
CD@@ U wants to be Hau@@ star@@ if at the staff
&quot; because it becomes more and more difficult to occupy free places , the CD@@ U demands to step out of the Emplo@@ yers Federation to become more attractive . &quot;
only shortly before the summer break the cre@@ ist@@ ag has scored 41 new places in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have their first working day after their first working day .
the teachers in the circle are obviously very popular .
about 6@@ 20 applications were reported for the seats in this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle continues to pass on personnel to cope with the Ascen@@ ded requirements and tasks . &quot;
&quot; currently , there are currently 50 jobs in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; among other things physicians and engineers , as well as forces of general administration . &quot;
the CD@@ U would now like to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
the administration is intended to develop a concept for personnel recovery and personnel development after the wish of the parties . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term needs for professionals , but in the future @-@ oriented of the applicants , it is said . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be based on the inside and outside , to show concrete measures for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and include an exemplary model , call CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
it sounds a good start after a good approach .
for the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know earlier .
other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; the speech is of a &quot; &quot; right &quot; &quot; competition of the public employer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ conditioned from the service . &quot;
&quot; so , take the highest time to action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ op@@ les , Leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party . &quot;
he was already in the cre@@ ist@@ ag for a lazy surprise as he asked the personnel char@@ tering publicly and was start@@ led by the other parties .
peoples want to be checked for all possibilities which allow an exit from the municipal employer association .
&quot; if we fail to arrive at a satisfactory solution here at short notice , the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the urban cities - asp@@ ire a Hau@@ star@@ if &quot; , &quot; so peoples . &quot;
&quot; by doing so , the CD@@ U seeks to pay the employees and officials to pay better than what is the rates for the Public Service actually fores@@ ee@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , elev@@ ations or more money there is only if one changes into a higher level that is oriented at professional years . &quot;
&quot; however , the tasks of the circle have grown more and more over the past few years . &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees are concerned about the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute law . &quot;
not least by the rising number of asylum seekers have Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone to NGO @-@ migrants @-@ b@@ ail@@ out
&quot; in Italy , NGOs , the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean must be warned that they cannot continue , if they do not comply with new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs not submit a new code of code , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came one day after the Italian authorities had seized upon a boat of the German aid organization &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet , &quot; because their team had worked effectively with traffi@@ ckers in a manner which facilitated the illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the relief organization , which has only been in operation for one year , declined it to express themselves in detailed allegations of the Italian pro@@ secutor of Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are sorry that we cannot operate at the moment in search and rescue zone , &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can judge all accus@@ ations , which are currently raised , only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that its occupation takes tu@@ din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board , which can be delivered to them directly by men &apos;s retailers and that the smug@@ gler can be used again , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; it was allegedly just 1,3 miles in front of the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the pro@@ secutor , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is da@@ ined by authority of the authority of the Italian coastal guard , who monitors the b@@ ail@@ out rates in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motiv@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; under the conduct of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must mainly have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations , have so far been prepared to keep up the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS of Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules were regarded as unnecessary , but acceptable as they wouldn &apos;t bring any &quot; significant changes or disability &quot; of their b@@ ail@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates organization doctors are without limits ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; Minn@@ iti said in the meantime , that the number of migrants agreed upon b@@ ail@@ out measures in Italy came greatly in the past few weeks , which suggests the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and working with the local civil servants . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month , about economic development initiatives and with Tsch@@ ad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that can leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
An@@ sti@@ ce and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ mar Bi@@ kers , the &quot; &quot; Berlin exterior &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Palat@@ inate to enjoy four days long as well as tourist attractions . &quot;
there were three liber@@ ated guides available to this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there followed view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the pl@@ ate@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream planes . &quot;
in between there was time and again a longer period of asc@@ ents for the long triumph@@ al reward .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival .
&quot; again , lookout point at the viewpoint , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
on the last two days a lot of altitude @-@ metres were told .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and car@@ ts brought a welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ ker in the free@@ wheel inhal@@ er Sole .
also Neu@@ stadt was controlled .
&quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometers and almost 4@@ 500 metres , the group had met the Pf@@ alz forest from its best - sporty and culturally . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundesliga ge@@ ars up for e @-@ sport
do the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles , rather than struggling with wind and weather over the stadium ? &quot;
&quot; fact is : e @-@ Sport has long since become a serious business , into a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high passages . &quot;
&quot; these have also recognized the first federal ga@@ des , which are increasingly involved in this area . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two pros for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire completely new young audiences in V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Executive Board Jo@@ chen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is sure that there are still several clubs rising on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the next weekend , the soccer world @-@ association FIFA organised the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in which gam@@ ers compete against each other in the event . &quot;
&quot; besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven quali@@ fies . &quot;
also Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has now consul@@ ted a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 years old , that young people also have to go into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract , you might be able to present online more often more often on these markets than once a year to send the Federal President to Asia once a year . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; at the E @-@ Sport , computer games are like &quot; League of Le@@ gends , &quot; D@@ ot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; D@@ ot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or even the football simulation of FIFA on competition level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in the normal sport also , Li@@ gen is established , in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and with Asia , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it a real sport style ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; for many , the idea is for sure . &quot;
even In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ous has long been confronted with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and many biological and physical reactions show that one can also find in classical sport - for example , increased heart rate , stress actions , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there are cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a quick response capability . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console , but also to train their bodies and pay attention to the diet . &quot;
&quot; the fine player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; F@@ rob@@ bery also looks problems : &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more an issue . &quot;
controls are difficult to run on online games and in the scene l@@ acked the structures of the classic sport .
positive highlights the scientists the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
&quot; the players are on their way internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural barriers . &quot;
a study of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association for Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros were implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsorship and great tournaments . &quot;
in three years sales will be at 130 million .
&quot; against the almost 2,@@ 4 billion euros of the soccer league this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
international are many countries already on .
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ Bas@@ ket@@ ball@@ ers Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez participate in the US Team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ashton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ competition Uni@@ cr@@ n .
there is a lot in Europe too .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sports has been introduced as a class , says F@@ rob@@ bery . &quot;
in the Netherlands and France the soccer league from D@@ utt are obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; in the European comparison &quot; &quot; Germany lag@@ ging Germany &quot; , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Executive Board Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only in nostal@@ gia to fall , and the old days to clear , is no longer enough . &quot;
&quot; it is about preserving the tradition of the association , but the company will also align it on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot;
&quot; there you can not stick to it , that only in football everything remains as it was always . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter because of the texts , who are pushing Con@@ rad Roy for su@@ icide , &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts has been condemned to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls to su@@ icide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind G@@ it@@ tern and five years were exposed to currency . &quot;
&quot; Carter was condemned in June because of a casual killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the father of Roy , on Thursday during the hearing : &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ted . &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free to appeal .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal representatives argue that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red pants and a cre@@ me@@ ous bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes , when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have expressed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the Pro@@ secutor of the Court . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has not taken responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any repentance . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ te lawyer said , it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they completely regret . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz told however , he did not find that their &quot; age or maturity or even their cl@@ ergy &apos;s disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a pro@@ secutor las a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is no day when I was not the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want it to be proud of me and how I work with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we will carry for eternity with us , for his sisters like being there , &quot; said it in it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would never be pro@@ secuted from the realization &quot; &quot; I will never take part in the wedding of her brother , or would be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this only person to have with which I was together for my birth every day is a pain that I will keep in mind for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to put a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to commit to another to commit to su@@ icide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 from a coal @-@ oxid@@ ation in a vehicle .
&quot; the case drew national attention to himself , after Car@@ te &apos;s text signs revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging on , spring from a building , e@@ che yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many paths , &quot; &quot; she said in several news , which she sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the eye eye before his su@@ icide she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; All that you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told that Carter &apos;s attention was looking through the death of Roy and instruc@@ ted that through any press they would benefit from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; to the few , the Carter defended , belonged to Amanda Kno@@ x who was sentenced in 2007 because of murder on its British co @-@ mate in Italy before it was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times published a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run me at the Audi Cup as captain was not accidental .
the FC Bayern makes the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner a big season - extra motivation is not al@@ lied .
&quot; what was different at his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ me immediately , even if the extra gar@@ ment was very small , very small . &quot;
&quot; but since far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m , and also no Manuel Neu@@ er was able to see , he made himself accessed bin@@ ds by the arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as a Bayern @-@ captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the impression could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign of the Coach could also indicate me so .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was in the youth players who have chosen the existing C @-@ El@@ f as a guide , but he was chosen . &quot;
&quot; it is the dearest one for those who want to kill a lot , that you want to keep in mood . &quot;
&quot; so who are chosen to engage the heritage of Lah@@ m , a small extra motivation can only be good . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ ber@@ me confirmed : &quot; &quot; this is what you like as a player : responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ lam@@ m over the field .
&quot; right at the rear , which is now its position , the white bin@@ der on the arm did her rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ ber@@ summar@@ ies me like the one who can put the rod even the best in his hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to draw the un@@ played tro@@ upe . &quot;
he had the look for the whole while many others were busy with himself .
&quot; Vid@@ al therefore , to re@@ play its missing fitness ( fol@@ ly hardly ) ; Renato San@@ ches thereby , on devil come out to the achievements of Asia @-@ journey ( fol@@ ly also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus , in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
this is very good at all .
&quot; in addition to Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy was running off the defense , both agi@@ cally sovereign . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ occupied Nap@@ oli @-@ Sturm is often difficult , moreover , Sü@@ le tried to succeed in playing a few times even in the game structure . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy gave me , that the result was &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; shift , tempo change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; how un@@ living this Bavaria world still lives for the more accessible , one looked after the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy for example was not one or two , but surely six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ ber@@ ley said to a few cris@@ p statements on the back of his new fellow @-@ player .
&quot; there he heard about an interesting phrase here : &quot; &quot; what goes here , I already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he does not have to teach the new one . &quot;

company pleased with Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ alz @-@ Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ dom Tempo
&quot; it has often been irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still economic minister@@ ing in Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; this is reflected after more than one year , in which the new Economic Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region speak at T V request from a change in economic policies and bl@@ acks at the same time the old minister .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , President of the Association of Tri@@ er Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing does not attack the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all has blocked . &quot;
the biggest revers@@ als of Nat@@ us sees Nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the loop of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is in the pri@@ ori@@ fic list of the country now entirely up .
this year the Ministry is hoping for a plan of planning to 2021 the building right .
&quot; a role in the plans of the country is also played by the West@@ um Tri@@ er , which stands in the urgent need for the federal law . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to take into operation the circuit in December 2020 , says Minister of Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us sees it a sign for regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Tri@@ er strives to be stimulated by Wis@@ sing , at the wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to boost the sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Know is an open ear for people who want to create an own company , pra@@ ises the I@@ HK . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce Tri@@ er sees the new master @-@ bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; intended is a premium of 1,000 euros for the component examination and 2500 Euro , when graduates are self @-@ evident within ten years after the master training . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; at the planned road building are quick facts to create , at the same time missing it to the country at the necessary staff , says Jan Bell &apos;s , Chief Executive Officer of the I@@ HK Tri@@ er . &quot;
&quot; from 56 new engineers , who wants to susp@@ end the Wis@@ sing at the Landes@@ bank mobility , have so far been occupied in 29 places . &quot;
the Chamber of Industry calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U @-@ Group vice @-@ group Christian Bal@@ d@@ on refers to calculations of the invoice , the country will invest more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of national roads . &quot;
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
&quot; furthermore , the previous broad@@ band has also been harvested in the country . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had reviewed the power supply in a I@@ HK survey only with the Note 3.4 . &quot;
it compl@@ ained about sc@@ iss@@ ful Internet connections and break@@ downs .
&quot; on the contrary , ex @-@ economic Minister of E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the wind power@@ house Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Greens , the Green Group for@@ so@@ ok Lem@@ ke on April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where it already covers the field after four months due to dis@@ agreements . &quot;
Audi is supposed to alter 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - Aut@@ oh@@ er@@ ers are confronted with a counter @-@ reaction
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW president said that &quot; &quot; there is smar@@ ter options as chassis restrictions , &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to ban or limiting . &quot;
Daimler announced that there are three million Mercedes cars to modify in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the company as a recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nit@@ rogen oxi@@ des , which e@@ mit diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of automobile manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ alization of the neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles to install Ab@@ g@@ ase , take also what it makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged to pamp@@ er the powerful auto@@ companies and ignore the signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen to regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ ters , emissions to regulate the provisions when a car was tested , but back in normal travel conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees have been indicted by Volkswagen , others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics in Germany was arrested in Germany over the past month . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , the Italian and therefore cannot be protected from delivery and could be put in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Audi was included in German criminal investigation in Volkswagen at the beginning of this year , following the authorities of Audi to have installed a system to deal with emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that was concentrated on the United States . &quot;
&quot; the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could be imp@@ aired Volkswagen heavy , the luxury car manufacturer contributes propor@@ tionally to the gain of Volkswagen . &quot;

the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; by doing so , the Is@@ ar visitors take a raft along the morning Saturday a raft through Munich , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; if it comes to Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft there between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach bridge . &quot;
and this is not a common float , with Is@@ ar @-@ tourists . &quot;
but the construction is to clarify .
on the float you can see a big screen saver .
it shows a trash .
&quot; the start to a public campaign , to call to the Is@@ ar visitors . &quot;
with the motto &quot; True Love Is ... &quot; is to raise the understanding of the Is@@ ar as a protective wild .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and the laughter against the grief
&quot; Mor@@ dill@@ o was temporarily one of the most published carto@@ ons carto@@ on@@ ists , the cel@@ i@@ ases of his figures are his trademark . &quot;
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine stands still and works on a film .
&quot; his message : laugh , &quot; &quot; because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ ill@@ us Mor@@ dill@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires . &quot;
in the first years as an artist he proposed other things as dra@@ wer for jo@@ gging cards - which was frustrated .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris had succeeded : with the release of his Carto@@ ons in Paris Match &apos; and then also in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ dill@@ o found many fans .
and again the artist inspired by cities .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ dill@@ o @-@ figures tum@@ ble in drawings with the shooting tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; according to the early morning he is still sitting in the drawing , and still works on the drawing , works almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; about calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ shirts , Pl@@ ush @-@ animals and watches find their dro@@ ll figures further spread worldwide . &quot;
&quot; for six years he has been working on a cartoon feature film , and a TV series with its figures . &quot;
&quot; the main person in the film &quot; &quot; Crazy Island &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in its drawings - that has a thou@@ ght@@ gl@@ iness as a counter @-@ player . &quot;
&quot; for the first time his figures speak in the 3D movie , the 2019 is to come to the chin @-@ wall . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they say , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ dill@@ o . &quot;
the screen@@ play is not written by him .
&quot; therefore , it is based on the TV series , which is produced , as its original desig@@ nations , wor@@ t@@ lessly produced . &quot;
lav@@ ender from Provence is threatened by climate change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lav@@ ender is due to due to drought remin@@ ding conditions and due to the diseases of insects , what scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , Expert of the Agricultural Institute for CR@@ IE@@ PP@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the spring and fall much more in the spring and fall much more in the autumn . &quot;
this has effects on the life of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small ornam@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacterial , the d@@ warf @-@ calves , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
lav@@ ender oil l@@ ures not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers ; it is also very sought for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; so , we have less parts with etheric oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered to be considered are a better water distribution and the slo@@ wing of the ev@@ oc@@ ation of the ground , but also the checked of plants with a protective blend of sound and water and the development of varieties which are resistant to drought . &quot;

the assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet in order to review their plans for the reporting of the latest chaos in Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ ceas@@ eless drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
it has been told to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure : they are supposed to take their children to the office , which in 2009 were the goal of an attack with granite , or at home . &quot;
&quot; safety experts have written three words to a table at the front of the room : opponents , Neutr@@ al , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the Reporter , names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perceptions and abdom@@ inal . &quot;
&quot; there are drug addic@@ ts , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspi@@ cion to stand on the secret list of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest period from violence , and while throughout the country the bodies of cor@@ p@@ ses are increasing : at least 25 , since President Enri@@ que Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to took place in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are standing after attacks and threats under Bundes@@ schutz and until now there was at least seven deaths in seven countries this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , their editors and their inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; its absence is felt deep even though his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , which shows its medium @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; , hanging t @-@ shirts in the mid @-@ 12 years , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the porters discuss their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , its nightmare , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although in 2010 , a Son@@ der @-@ Federal Office was built to edit the cases of journalists , according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of kill@@ ers who are linked each year with drug stores and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely put on trial . &quot;
&quot; in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still insist on the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a while they are un@@ clou@@ dy and even though the terrain is now in stock . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting concerning the discussion of security has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very silly to squ@@ ander my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we know not the Why , we mis@@ trust all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the provincial capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla has been stopped by two men . he was forced from his car and 12 times was shot at him , presumably due to the name of the newspaper - the &quot; T@@ wel@@ ded River . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an free to fly .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and delivery in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of missed , two @-@ story Maus@@ ole@@ en for drug roy@@ alty , which are bigger than many houses for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility , &quot; if only a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February the publication of a interviews with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of the rival@@ ing cart@@ els in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may be anno@@ yed the sons , suspected gang@@ members bought each copy of the issue , as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; the second error was to force Val@@ dez , not to force according to the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper which has published the same story to leave the country to its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues won that he would always be there .
he was active in 2003 as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este as he joined the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in 2003 and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the cra@@ w@@ ry problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; at the time , the newspaper served a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising revenue . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porters loved it to publish hard @-@ wise investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for their reporting in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuit of the Mexican drug history , wherever it brought . &quot;
he gave himself up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J distinction . &quot;
&quot; drug trade in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV in October last October . &quot;
you have to take the task that you as a journalist falls - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I would not like to be asked : &quot; &quot; what did you have done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team miss Val@@ dez , the spa@@ wning @-@ bird , who was like a harbour worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
you trusted on his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ n@@ abo , the bar across from the office , and always sitting there at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now , ask her : was his love for routine his destruction ? &quot;
&quot; his death also has forced them to question their own assumptions on how to get their work best , and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you are dealing with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ way and cross @-@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it smells wrong , you keep away from it . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; smell a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing with Javier has happened . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer considered in Sin@@ alo@@ a , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smug@@ glers , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape changes constantly .
&quot; in the room where the employees met Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce for safety training , suddenly there were no mobile phones allowed . days before has been known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , for monitoring journalists and activists living in Mexico . &quot;
outside two poli@@ c@@ emen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the national government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters were asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of poli@@ c@@ emen , which the governor itself was not trustworthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountain scenery , where drug gangs are under control . &quot;
for the issue of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has al@@ ded on three main stories .
there was the assassination of the brother of the former known box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the government spending which focused on the hometown of the Govern@@ ors .
&quot; there was a group contained in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s office , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local retailer and authorities . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porter of public records , that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy leader , who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , who ruled almost the whole century all political levels . &quot;
recently several Pr@@ i govern@@ ors have been accused because of high @-@ quality cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this pub , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man got a military over@@ fall . &quot;
just a few months before the reader had seen the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about kidn@@ apping .
&quot; in the past we had already knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ s . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez was devoted to storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers who protest against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the staff have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
&quot; on the R@@ ami@@ rez Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist for the office of the Pro@@ secutor . &quot;
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; a burnt body has been discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is his . &quot;
&quot; in the whole country , journalists have become stronger , having been written in organized &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on walking paths and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on this day , the director of Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone in Washington and tried to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the Governor of Sin@@ hal@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities , journalists and bring them around because they told the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has been asked that she was once again divided by the government , because it is concerned that their anger has violated their objectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez has repeatedly told that journalists in Mexico by organised crime , involved in government officials and a simultaneous society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs but also on command of politicians and security guards which have organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , the media &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials in the past year . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico @-@ minded you give , because they would like you keep the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a de@@ terr@@ ent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; your body was signed together with a note that was supposedly signed by the Z@@ etas de Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer @-@ stat@@ s and ear@@ phones located next to their separate head .
&quot; some stores have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te at the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua according to the assassination of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
others continue to do as it did El Man@@ ana from Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of their director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez made public attention to the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ?
some journalists are fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they will be hun@@ ted , as it was obviously murdered by the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , which was killed in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; to those who stay back and continue working , it is a daily dance with risky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , gives us that the drug trade is sc@@ ared him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I was re@@ porter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat down before the office and drank beer , than once all their phones began to be sum@@ mon@@ ed . &quot;
a series of sli@@ ps with Band@@ reefs and security guards near the bath@@ or@@ tes Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated continues as promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
&quot; from the on @-@ board stone , they released the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on mobile phone . &quot;
the front page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ a@@ ts close to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez gave a look at the poli@@ c@@ emen . the guards held to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid they did not showed it .
&quot; under the powerful portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose Central finger was visible for the whole Sin@@ hal@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed its mark . &quot;
&quot; how can you also only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if on the same day , on which Javier was murdered , the practic@@ ant asked me to send them to reporting on the road . &quot;
din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to so@@ ften its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue if also a terri@@ fying .
&quot; now researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible nas@@ cent of a Canadian mountain work@@ ers have been so well received , that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so good that they could even notice that his love of red@@ dish @-@ like Braun was - and they said , they would have had something from a &quot; troubled past . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology &quot; recorded it as &quot; the ter@@ med @-@ ter@@ med din@@ os@@ aur@@ s that has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ os@@ aur@@ s in the world . &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ aur@@ s that lived in the middle of the chal@@ k between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved state has researchers , who describe it as &quot; really remarkable &quot; , &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ aters is the best preserved fossil food of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was on 21 March 2011 at Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something , out of the surrounding rock was missing , and decided to see more exact . &quot;
the Fossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only see a little with the eyes blin@@ king , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum , where the creature is visible . &quot;
&quot; it is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , the Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this plant @-@ e@@ aters , although it is covered with an arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by meat and send din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age in order to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a par@@ achu@@ ti@@ bility that is used as a counter@@ case , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed to mix better in its surroundings and so@@ ften its enemies , say experts , which suggests that there was threatened by greater din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ r has made head@@ lines in May and is now at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Muse@@ um@@ ste@@ ker Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to cover it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the ast@@ ounding preservation of the specimen allowed it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ or through his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ aded , a widespread defence method in wildlife , meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ sh@@ aded is common , the results are surprising since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s were hun@@ ted by enough pressure by flesh , and the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s that the evolution fav@@ ored the wear of the confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most of the most contemporary animals , which use the counter @-@ sh@@ aded - think of deer , z@@ ebras or gir@@ ders - are much smaller and vulnerable as a prey , which sign@@ aled that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ r was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ ory behavior on a massive , strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s show how dangerous the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s predat@@ ors have been to have been the chal@@ k @-@ time &quot; , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their sk@@ als also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r . brown .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal on references about his life , including his labour @-@ fourth intest@@ ines to find out what it had eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , when he died , driven into a river and was driven out into the sea where he sun@@ k on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alberta has been as warm as Süd@@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans most likely more widespread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ r is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with consistent skin , but also in three dimensions remains and the original form of the animal retains , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal is almost as similar today as in the early chal@@ k time .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just have a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it is at bed@@ time . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time when huge Ther@@ opo@@ den , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ os@@ aur@@ s that were standing on two legs , the earth crossed . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them lived , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors . &quot;
&quot; the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons he@@ avier monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta has been vers@@ ed after death in the sea and in the mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was on 21 March 2011 at Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum it is the ter@@ med @-@ ter@@ med din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have wei@@ ghed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long tips that ra@@ zed by his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed crop @-@ e@@ aters have been m@@ apped by the Western Canada , until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea . &quot;
&quot; however , the underwater ascent of the din@@ os@@ aur@@ ers keep his arm@@ or in exquisite detail . &quot;
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still b@@ umpy e@@ pl@@ ings along the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s .
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &apos; rare as a profit in the Lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more confusing it gets . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of the skin still cover the b@@ umpy tank plates that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right for@@ ef@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers crossed upwards . &quot;
I can count the scales in his sole .
in the storm : mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ dness on A@@ 8 : many wounded
&quot; heavy accident on Thursday , Thursday on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age . &quot;
&quot; there are numerous wounded , long @-@ long rod - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age , about 20 people have been injured . &quot;
&quot; after the first data of the police were at 5 : 00 am between the connection and Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( County of Ai@@ ch@@ ah @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm barely 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , inter@@ locking . &quot;
&quot; first , there is no information on the exact number of injured . &quot;
&quot; it is a light to moderate severe injury , said a pol@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher . &quot;
a great deal of b@@ ail@@ out vehicles was at the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely locked towards Munich .
in the direction of Munich a round of ten kilometres was situated in the district of Munich .
&quot; as an A@@ Z re@@ porter reported , it came also on the back@@ train to massive disabilities - by numerous g@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire@@ fighters have noted the characteristic of the vehicle &apos;s features , which now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 , then there was a second accident on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it was a collision between a car and a car for a car . &quot;
a rescue @-@ helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that has experienced almost everyone at once : nothing is sitting on the train and sleeps .
or it is deep@@ ened into his work and has just an ingeni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
&quot; comes the creation , and w@@ akes up an uns@@ ur@@ ft or strikes the driving force in the middle of the work@@ flow . &quot;
ticket control .
but the times of breaks are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the creator @-@ card control .
one simply confirms the phone that you have taken his place and thus de@@ valu@@ ated the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test run on two routes are running . &quot;
&quot; when the offer comes , we expand it . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of next year , there is expected to be available on many other routes in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in , &quot; calls the rail card de@@ valuation without creation . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use , however , some requirements need to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - which is already the most passengers to do .
&quot; you must also have bought it via the app , the DB navig@@ ator , which is anyway the most convenient way of ticket sales . &quot;
and finally one needs a seat reservation .
&quot; for the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works so : one clim@@ bs on the train , calling his ticket under &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the test customers then appears a button for electronic de@@ valuation .
the Zug@@ companion will get on their mobile devices a message that Tim@@ g@@ ast X is located on the train and has taken the ge@@ bu@@ sted seat Y Y .
&quot; comes the train manager at the ticket control in place Y , he knows that a passenger is already sitting there with already ent@@ less online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue , keep quiet . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which again is to use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel without a ticket control by our train staff , check out the DB navig@@ ator just yourself . &quot;
&quot; it enables the passengers to shape their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing @-@ Management of DB Fern@@ andes . &quot;
second plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs .
&quot; who often goes , knows that besides delays and pas@@ siv@@ ly the ticket controls are to the biggest health conditions . &quot;
&quot; because often , in any case one of the fellow travelers do not have all the documents that you need for de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either no charge is a credit card or a document , or otherwise a document that you need to show . &quot;
&quot; the consequence are endless discussion between train guides and driving , which leads to worse atmosphere in the space or large space and delays in taking control of their own tickets and the Schaff@@ ner at the end time takes care of taking care of other matters . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that is only at the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further migr@@ atory numbers on the same circuit are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken to its core .
&quot; just one day after they arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis , on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which they rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled across a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and it is still on the street , &quot; it was called there . &quot;
&quot; confused , because no one had posted the information on their fe@@ ed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the r@@ apper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , who was killed , live live . &quot;
&quot; he po@@ sted a picture of bro@@ wns le@@ blo@@ ated body , stretching on the street and would stay there four hours . &quot;
&quot; this is wild , &quot; thought Fer@@ rell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she placed her cell phone later to return to T@@ we@@ et via people on the Can@@ field drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people , crying , and by a man who claimed to be Bro@@ wns father , who contributed a sign with the in@@ scription : &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they watched a live feed at which a poli@@ cem@@ an was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bell@@ ish dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , rejected a different poli@@ cem@@ an his ri@@ f@@ le , and cried : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; Fer@@ rell recalls her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can typically call .
at this moment I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
you booked a return trip and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she fet@@ ched her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; , &quot; in the cinemas from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and Protest@@ ants , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consist of the vision of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as a Fer@@ rell with her daughter who carried a flower dress and a suitable crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for that , what they believe in ? &quot; &quot; she reminded of what she said . &quot;
&quot; we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take them , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
she has to know and see it and be re@@ ared in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give her an experience , in which they personally experience no ec@@ cl@@ ant racism , she is no different than the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would prove to be a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a location opposite the police authority that became a camp@@ ground as the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
there was Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared pockets before and hal@@ ves they pass on prot@@ esters .
slowly began to accept a new type of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has been totally altered after 9 August , she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis president of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in organizing . &quot;
it is all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar only wanted to document &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came from Fer@@ rell in the meaning : &quot; &quot; do you document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; these skep@@ ticism was nourished by countless cases of people , often from wh@@ ites in a community that benefited from her sorrow and its resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; how Fol@@ ay@@ an said recently in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and grew up , their voices are not centered and we wanted to make it different . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an already worked together with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field , known for its activ@@ ism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt . &quot;
his engagement brought the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Bro@@ wns Er@@ sho@@ d .
&quot; this documentary is not somebody who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; this was the main thing for me as these people are represented , because I will be shown . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ y@@ ells &apos; experience - to show that it is the movement &quot; not about an Messiah , but &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most open participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ er &apos;s life , as she loves to love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ rell and lau@@ ghed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
&quot; but I have understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability during this work , and when the de@@ human@@ ization of black people must give a certain vulner@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ is history repeated the role of the black sw@@ am women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after the killing of the black teen@@ ager tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; in social media , identify as spon@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in executive positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must wear the main burden of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women .
&quot; however , it is based on that &quot; &quot; this is not a affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; in which Fer@@ rell was selected due to their identity as a heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not a coincidence , although she was at the forefront , because in a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel your energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long gone , but the racial connections between the church and the police remain . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on the currency for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ age of a highway in a demonstration .
it describes the social policy atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a mess .
&quot; nevertheless , they cl@@ ed themselves to a singing and she feels committed to that memory since three years ago she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on on the streets three years ago . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; dream &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; size &quot; &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery &quot;
&quot; the bit gallery moves the people , although it has not been built for a long time . &quot;
&quot; but the idea of a shopping centre at the south @-@ end of the pedestrian zone , divi@@ des the population into advocates and opponents . &quot;
&quot; cold , the subject hardly leaves one . &quot;
on our Facebook page &quot; People &amp; Bit@@ burg &quot; the topic is discussed .
&quot; while one can say to the bit @-@ gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; That would be real class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; does not need a human &quot; ( Sig@@ gi Bet@@ zen ) or quite simply , &quot; &quot; Or@@ as@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while pro@@ pon@@ ents have built that a gallery will attract more customers to the city , of which the rest of them benefit , fear the opponents of the pedestrian streets . &quot;
added : the gallery will be exactly planned on the property on which the market hall is available in the 13 Gover@@ ning market .
with the start of construction work will be the end .
&quot; the Galerie makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building , while Bed@@ a @-@ Square , with possibility to sit outside . &quot;
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been selling almost every week in the farmer &apos;s market for many years . &quot;
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the country are always happy to be very happy . &quot;
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
&quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; &quot; whether the direct market in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the height of the rent . &quot;
&quot; however , it is likely to be very low in the new project . &quot;
Eva Kili@@ c : &quot; what shopping spots in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothes , shoes , dr@@ yers or supermarkets : I find it unnecessary . &quot;
there are already enough of them in our city .
you see how many shop@@ pers can be empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but there is not even a decent weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall will remain intact . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is above @-@ purely inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , Lad@@ in stores will be located in a shopping center only by larger companies , as the dor@@ ms are often not portable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special businesses there is almost no more and what still remains of it , will probably even disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with a market hall does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the farmer &apos;s market during the construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even if the bit gallery will eventually occur .
or does it create the spec@@ s bit @-@ gallery before to exp@@ el all shops from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this is simply not working .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , does not need any one . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion it would have been better to have a real farm market place , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a peasant market hall , it &apos;s up to many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg is no place anymore . &quot;
&quot; when the farmers market hall is taken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost invisible , that hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the Artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and H@@ amm@@ ed@@ os that were sent to her from Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth where the former secret service analy@@ st took a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after they publicly proclaimed diplomatic messages about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks site .
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Be@@ coming St@@ blan@@ ce ( A suitable similarity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was united in technology , computer sciences and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and groundbreaking disco , whose conviction was turned by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his ministry . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorithms analysis of the DNA that could be extracted from Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , such as someone with these genom@@ ic data might look like , even if something intellectual comment could not only be interpreted by the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways of how they can be interpreted and the har@@ dening determin@@ ism of this interpre@@ tations , but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already been committed to identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , including six violations of the Spi@@ on@@ age@@ Act , Computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; in prison , her picture was sup@@ pressed , so much that there was only one photo - a bas@@ kets , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is clearly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ in@@ blonde pearl - with whom it was associated with . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of its 2012 project &quot; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
&quot; it produced the artist portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic ar@@ te@@ facts like cigarette smoke and che@@ wing g@@ um , extract the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look . &quot;
this was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; stated De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg in a press release of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be visited at this time , and she could not be photographed , so she took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use were sent to un@@ equal correc@@ tions over the course of two years .
&quot; they even created one of the Sho@@ ili can@@ ung@@ o illustrated Com@@ ic &quot; Sup@@ pressed Images , &quot; which would fores@@ ee a future in which the President Chel@@ ation would convert judgment , and she would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama is actually only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing release would demand for seven brutal years in a military coup in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome way of happy meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something low@@ land and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against Trans@@ form@@ ative troops to find new , twe@@ et ways that he actually should fix , continue to fl@@ out . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen to happen on a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the gallery on the written artistic statement , Mann@@ ing called with their over@@ large signature including ( the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in her family name ) is an end to the &quot; automatic de@@ frag@@ mentation , whose foundation may have been gender , racial , sexuality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thou@@ sand@@ wich of Cs and Gs and As , in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped , through the inclusion of the 200 characters ( or nuclear oti@@ de after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , how amazing , at least in biological things , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people hopefully will take with it is that our genome is not about who we are and how openly genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell as many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , kept in a separate room , is one side of the above com@@ ic No@@ vel@@ le mentioned above . &quot;
&quot; she shows Mann@@ ing , how it appears with a free pre@@ diction in hand from the discipl@@ in@@ arity of the United States as King Kong . &quot;
&quot; if they speak your speech , they have won , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so do never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the Artist that greeted from Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I still get ge@@ aring , when I speak about it . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it predicted in the com@@ ic book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , which collap@@ sed as hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also targeted , as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic H@@ ap@@ log@@ ins were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it feels like a mass movement that feels formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which also hidden behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford because of killing .
&quot; a country @-@ wide fish@@ y @-@ hunting is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who were sought after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries . &quot;
&quot; on Monday for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them@@ self ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) Ar@@ rest War@@ ren , because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau , were shown as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died . &quot;
&quot; one of the police authority , published by the police authority , states that the Lei@@ che was discovered on 27 July . &quot;
&quot; officials received a call , came to Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries in his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau still proclaimed the place of action for dead , and det@@ ective the stit@@ ches as murder while the police actively seeks after the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
La@@ them@@ self has been a professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University for 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ es , the vice @-@ president for university relationships , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them@@ self now had to be ruled abroad and excluded from the entry of the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal affair , which is studied by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help US investigation authorities in every conceivable way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shocked and want it to be .
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the Police Association of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he said the susp@@ ects firmly on the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to loc@@ alise them , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the property management of the Grand @-@ Plaza &apos;s building that had just had an en@@ ig@@ matic tip that said in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as a very cruel one .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July . &quot;
it has been confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them@@ self and War@@ ren in the building were .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza released a declaration to the residents : &quot; &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada roadmap in the near future &quot; &quot; - the Russian vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko &quot;
the Russian vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not last long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a particular stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ ada roadmap has been updated in this regard , &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of the W@@ ada , to comply with the Code that describes the criteria for the re @-@ setting of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could be concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria listed in the list is noted , however , that Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results obtained by the Canadian At@@ tor@@ ney Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on the alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we lead the investigation since our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has collap@@ sed an error . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos &apos;s words voted with those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales office R@@ sport at the beginning of the day , S@@ mir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly told that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; S@@ mir@@ nov was added . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ als of the W@@ ada of the execution of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
&quot; however , it was permitted to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the main agency of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving into the right direction . &quot;
Al@@ di sold no eggs about :
the shared management groups with .
&quot; it is a pure incident , it could further be assumed by no health impairment , it says in the communication . &quot;
&quot; from now on , eggs are likely to be supplied to Al@@ di , which have been proven neg@@ atively on fe@@ ather@@ ed anti @-@ lung disorders . &quot;

start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the happiness during your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the pol@@ ls didn &apos;t work .
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers were not aware of the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce H@@ air Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from outside to help .
&quot; a new race of the Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on the wax , to help companies find out how their employees feel . &quot;
&quot; by creating and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of the measurement of employee engagement , they allow companies to address surveys , special groups and demographic groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to circum@@ navigate the C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ Bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools used by companies to measure their employees . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ ret@@ t said that she had a better insight into what your employees think , and have won G@@ lin@@ t in the three years . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap Sur@@ ve@@ ys and surveys by certain teams , it provides a heat map of the company that have at a glance which units have most ail@@ ments and which managers can have low measures - so that you can check out why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the head of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber that has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ ale since then a former employee describes a blog post , who spoke an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment , in which those who have spoken , were punished . &quot;
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t this wish is an overview of an lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility .
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value in 2020 , following the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ ting companies tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat @-@ cards of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , which allows the employees to report a bad behaviour . &quot;
&quot; and if the main business guides are included , complaints will go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the Reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that his staff is poorly treated or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience precious consequences due to consumers boy@@ cott , employee flu@@ tu@@ ation and law@@ suits , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has been deployed C@@ cent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to have their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a intimi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good opportunity to track the complaints from employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company convertible to work , can problems that were formerly hidden by managers who have been hidden in offices in towns or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or irre@@ voc@@ able practitioner - quickly identified and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree perspective on experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders in front of employment , li@@ tigation . &quot;
&quot; companies began to take eth@@ ic , ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron scandal , Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it lasted until the &quot; Social Media came to their right &quot; , &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology for the monitoring of ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and strain the company with recur@@ rent fees for the use of their products . &quot;
&quot; it is a business model and an opportunity to find the consent of Venture Capital investors , which have supported both start @-@ ups . &quot;
&quot; convertible received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , which gave the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ itz@@ ern secured up to $ 10 million in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners , and brought its entire financing to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more than before . &quot;
competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only .
the staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to feel in a company that &apos;s their voices heard , and that work that you do is profitable , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience . &quot;
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ ten if their portfolio companies work well . companies are running well if employees are working with and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third promise , commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you find support . &quot;
the data on employee commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
&quot; however , the data is useless if administrators do not take action . &quot;
&quot; in fact , if a company asks employees after your feedback , it can have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , can dis@@ appointments and in@@ dem@@ oti@@ ves at all . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 discussions , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company to rely on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow , employees will ask themselves , &quot; Hab@@ t you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
and whom you don &apos;t care about why should I ?
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who has now passed monthly staff surveys , was able to initiate action on the same day when a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , she was able to organise new teams within the company by the quick@@ ness of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , capable of organizing several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; on Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run this leads to a better binding of workers in a industry that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; &quot; Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose company . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the br@@ other@@ ins
a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ ers are talking on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have moved their tri@@ kot@@ ar pieces and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these in@@ active minutes make a lunch break .
&quot; players who are registered to the summer courses will return after the three @-@ hour exercise , before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 to the water@@ man Football Center . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ ad@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and she has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three sessions of U@@ CL@@ A must begin at 19 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to meet the full @-@ packed schedules of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day , at which the Bru@@ ges moved almost one week after the last season , and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises . &quot;
they should hold 18 exercises in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 prior to the formal rules for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he support the control change of the N@@ CA@@ A support , even if they add a further point to the player &apos;s complex routes . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous burden three or four days on her , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it down , they plac@@ ent themselves , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ CL@@ A will finish its practices , as soon as the camp is termin@@ ated , what has been dis@@ car@@ ded by the clear lines of his fields from an adjoining car park and the adjoining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that is already covered with pedest@@ rians , which is a protective net behind a tor@@ ch @-@ posts , no easy task . &quot;
&quot; brood @-@ players should occupy the hotel starting this weekend , but Mor@@ a means that there could be a problem as soon as those rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then set off on it to record an exercise . &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ and from an exercise it is a fairly good deal .
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not too worried about this because of that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensify facts @-@ verification in the fight against counterf@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential items with counterf@@ eit@@ ing of third parties and show their results under the original post then the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News .
&quot; the company said in an opinion on his website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to send possible fal@@ cons and to send them to fac@@ t@@ aller , which may display results of the fact inspection from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of which have been influenced by the US presidential election in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , whereby the French voters were flooded in advance of the presidential elections in May with wrong stories , and Germany will support a plan according to social media networks , if it does not succeed to eradic@@ ate H@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate explanation to German that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of the new facts review . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the realization that stories of fac@@ ten@@ ders third parties are challenged , people want to make more context in order to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product man@@ ag@@ ger for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature related to the &quot; &quot; related articles &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to his messages Fe@@ ed to decrease false news . &quot;
creating a com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ ting hole for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ he years .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cozy seat at the Be@@ wl River Valley in K@@ ent and now is now for inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look for the manuscript of someone who has been dead for over 300 years , &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; embr@@ aced the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney - Isaac Len@@ kie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes , which is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he had unexpected emotional . &quot;
&quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ b pressure on the side of a letter , which was written by a double car in the 1700 @-@ s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thum@@ b pressure ! &quot;
&quot; and letters always smell to smoke , because at that time one lit a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as if he himself were also involved . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who be@@ aten so with old Pap@@ ers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest ) , this seems too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rhodes spent his days exploring the vi@@ kt@@ orian &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; castle to explore the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mon@@ oton@@ ous hybrid heads at the walls and the bottles , the centuries spent in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emigr@@ ated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landsc@@ ap@@ ron , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and started writing . &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , because the National Trust was only given full access in 2006 as the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died . &quot;
&quot; when Rhodes came a decade later , the employees started to take care of the archive that he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Ar@@ isto@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; &quot; Oh , wir@@ es it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English emp@@ ires , maps , which represent what he possessed : &quot; you might think that land conflict would be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch for which two families have fought . &quot;
guys , let &apos;s go all his course ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on a broader basis in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; which leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a turmoil that 13@@ 80 came in the castle in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ fe &apos; of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rhodes . &quot;
the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start .
perhaps the two are connected to each other ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle , like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who tells the story of the Jesu@@ it &apos;s history , that the family has hidden seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell is represented in the 18th century , who filled his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later than his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be a cro@@ iss@@ ant , getting back debts and spend money for things that they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell men solve their debt crises , while rich old women mar@@ ry - I imagine it as a pile of well @-@ looking guys before , with a talent to advertise refresh@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his use in the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique write @-@ experiences . &quot;
&quot; he has taken a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about E@@ ven@@ män@@ mä@@ ki behind herself , the terrain of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed from nature again . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like , &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ en@@ cap@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the revelation of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ en@@ cap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef on Friday launched its campaign for the introduction of a new roof mark ( Rundschau with Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz the logo and the slogan . &quot;
&quot; at the end of August , it will be a highlight of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th . &quot;
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? &quot; ask the creators of the promotion since yesterday on the posters at the rh@@ einf@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; &quot; write them on their own released website . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are convinced that we as a Bad Honnef citizen we know very well about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; in the action it is more than &quot; only &quot; a logo and a slogan , &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate an all @-@ embr@@ acing promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able imagination . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
a middle five @-@ digit amount will cost the town of Bad Honnef their new roof mark and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; each year at the beginning of August consul@@ ts in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on pen@@ sion@@ ers and subsidies in the officers &quot; officer . &quot;
this week also this week .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine of the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; discussions at the presidency of the Heads of State also took the five vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ ers as well as the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; thus , the civilians in the Y@@ as were in the flood . &quot;
the government moves the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; governor Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y were set off . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als has been fired . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army , mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees the Erdo@@ gan as the wire pull of the coup . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people , which should be involved immediately after the put@@ sch@@ ation , is in Ankara this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup Erdo@@ gan had the overthrow of &quot; &quot; God present &quot; , &quot; as he give him the opportunity to puri@@ fy the armed forces . &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan really have the army in control ?
at the end of February the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ eas@@ iness in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
&quot; in the General Staff , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which among other things manifested in the lifting of the head@@ sc@@ arf ban for sol@@ dat@@ as , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the big rein@@ forces in the army and the security guards goes on any way .
&quot; in the middle of July Erdo@@ gan by decree , another 7@@ 3@@ 95 state fire fire , including 2@@ 303 poli@@ c@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan was the military t@@ amed .
the gener@@ als appear earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times put@@ ted them under appeal to their role as a guardian of the worldly state order .
&quot; after his election in 2002 Erdo@@ gan passed the power of the military step by step , not least on appeal to the reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is targeted by the Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; a particularly @-@ called officer who sought for asylum in fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be in a few years &quot; full of extremis@@ ts and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; if this is the case , such development could not be cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , in the Alliance , there is doubts about the cleansing of the Turkish army in the alliance . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; tell Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he sees prior to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Re@@ public@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill &apos;s draft should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and increase billions of dollars for tax@@ payers , and will do so by the US to change the way the citizens from other countries of Green Cards will be spent . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will come good to the candidates who have the financial resources to assist themselves and show knowledge that our economy will come to good , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to re@@ comp@@ ose the trail for racing .
&quot; over the past few months , over the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les had been denied - now it should go very quickly . &quot;
&quot; even before the end of the year , at the same circuit , on which the tourist road drives , will be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the racing period in the long term , according to information from the Federal Ministry of Commerce this year , construction projects will begin on the track . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order and san@@ ize the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country knows itself especially for the tourism important connection , &quot; explained traffic secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost of the maintenance of the route was reduced to about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country over@@ take 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the shuttle will also be ordered in the future from the country , will be finally tuned , stated S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the Southern railway as the operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; thus the roadmap , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway society will be closed for a period of eleven years .
thus the race shuttle will be ordered on December 2017 .
the race shuttle is one of the popular rail links between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; over the past few months , in the course of a pilot company , it was tested whether the circuit is used by sufficiently many people to order them in the future again . &quot;
the track is also in part heavily di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it cannot be any crazy , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , in fact . &quot;
sex @-@ robots are currently a big thing .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ated Professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start to take their ascent seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ els . &quot;
&quot; people make themselves funny , but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more often , &quot; Mr. Shar@@ key said in the publication of his new report . &quot;
&quot; modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicon skin , which feels warm to the touch of human reactions , which are achieved through artificial intelligence . &quot;
&quot; the user can also adjust its robots according to his beliefs &quot; , &quot; and select everything from the eye colour of the robot by the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of its f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it is still disturbing , since many robots have the &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; that would make a step@@ ford @-@ wife progressive . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed to robot@@ ic with a silicon skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robots allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as relap@@ se . &quot;
and then there are the &quot; True &quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; which gives the impression of relap@@ se and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , war@@ ms the website of True Re@@ y . &quot;
&quot; it may like what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you do not like , etc . &quot;
in the course of the day she also has its m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can &quot; &quot; be in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the under@@ lining female properties , when one step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is said here : conflic@@ ting ) Far@@ rah is , be@@ ad@@ orable a most . &quot;
on his website true artist Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy with a Vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a Vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; means it &apos;s on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex @-@ robots are not only a fairy or simply another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; its creation and growing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of equal rights of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission than op@@ tion@@ ale en@@ core . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course keep no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notice their rising popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumption . &quot;
&quot; what per@@ oo@@ zes out of the edge @-@ zones can be in relation to the spirit of time , in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
and many people are not wei@@ rd or insul@@ ting until the free market gives permission .
&quot; there is nevertheless a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time when the rights of women are threatened , in which there is a president in the White House who has led to women to have sexually attacked women . &quot;
&quot; the most aw@@ ful aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the curved body and the extinct eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the aim behind these sex robots is to establish a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their inheritance want to feel that they feel human and im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but to be brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots do not represent real women . &quot;
they cannot be separated from their companions or simply go away .
&quot; they have no placement or a background history , nothing that could interfere with independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission . &quot;
otherwise expressed : they are fake slaves .
or to express it in the Rede@@ mption of 2017 : maid
trou@@ gh great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney for the essence of a healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a t@@ len@@ tic@@ ular of the tr@@ ump era that the political divisions , which have pol@@ arized the US constitu@@ encies , have also split families in small @-@ format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and harvest festival , there were newspapers with advice on how to handle the horror of Tr@@ ump sel@@ fish@@ ers . &quot;
we all said to us all allegedly in order to burst our filtration .
&quot; less noticed is the power Tr@@ umps , families together . &quot;
&quot; I mention this , because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ oriented poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Re@@ public@@ ans in our family , who visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; tr@@ ump in the White House is everyone who knows it , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ dre@@ d , with which she fought for decades due to politics , suddenly and very stran@@ gely on the same side . &quot;
&quot; around the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in another context that this also brings significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the horri@@ fying effect of his presidency has the strength to push all right to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ly possibility that his mosquit@@ oes of one day will no longer come across . &quot;
&quot; however , there is still a more complicated long @-@ time scenario , in which Tr@@ ump Re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes , &quot; which suddenly appeared in comparison with his standards as a by@@ word of reasonable . &quot;
&quot; I find myself today from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s com@@ ic version of the mad@@ man , which saw 14 % income tax ( but at least , we knew how his tax statement looked ) - both in comparison to tr@@ ump occur in fact a very mild crime . &quot;
&quot; if Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only be mentally healthy to qualify as un@@ measurable improvement . &quot;
&quot; as my c@@ ousin in the city was , we brought our children to the Car@@ us@@ sell at Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ells of the New York parking department , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if you do not need any caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all the clo@@ wns are cris@@ p and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climatic music makes this an unforgettable way . &quot;
&quot; so many se@@ is@@ che@@ ers of a city dis@@ appoint , the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is however still a strange magical experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could rate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked him afterwards . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I took my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my road it is the same , plus the option to aver@@ t the rating with a 15 % ti@@ pping - this in order to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to involve personality in a situation where no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was exc@@ used , while I tired the experience made her my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar pist@@ ori@@ us with breast pain transferred to the hospital
pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for the second time in a hospital .
&quot; last year he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts to his wr@@ ists , which he suffered from prison authorities according to a fall in his cell . &quot;
pist@@ ori@@ us was condemned because of murder in an appeal to the pro@@ secut@@ ors against a first death sentence .
&quot; he killed ste@@ en@@ kam@@ p in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Day , by calling them several times through a door of the toilet in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria on her . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us asser@@ ted that he held his girlfriend for a night intru@@ der , who hid in the cabin . &quot;
the pro@@ secut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year imprisonment sentence by pist@@ ori@@ us appeal to which they say it is too clear .
&quot; the National Criminal Law Agency said that they will rise in the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection may be heard in this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us risk is danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful .
there is no penalty in South Africa .
as a peasant Arnold a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the flo@@ wer@@ ies schools , the neighborhoods of F@@ eb@@ ies and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and further schools . &quot;
three of the kid@@ dents in the future go into the gram@@ mar school and four to the Real@@ school .
school @-@ leader Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
&quot; the 29 students of the four classes of four classes , led by Sophia Schu@@ macher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des a young eagle , who grows at the hen farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the m@@ under@@ e Sch@@ ar introduced a musical with the title &quot; &quot; The eagle at the chicken . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it from his chicken . &quot;
instead of a chicken and a small eagle came out .
&quot; but the hope to make out of him a chicken , cutting himself on a high mountain on a high mountain , and escaped . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken . &quot;
&quot; h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder bore to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the eagle stand for the integration , said school @-@ leader Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the young is different from the other young animals ( chi@@ cks ) , but in addition . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
&quot; his purpose is to be free . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she had to wish every four @-@ cl@@ ap that he feels in his new school .
&quot; it was followed by the colleagues , the former school@@ manager Michael Müller , who always jump into teaching pilot , and the parents representatives . &quot;
&quot; the kitchen @-@ time is now over , the classroom Sophia Schu@@ macher declared . &quot;
&quot; she leaves her students after two years of teaching only , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , I can rely on the neighborhoods . &quot;
at the end all students sound a song of summer time and holiday season .
in doing so he got great pleasure in the children .
eight Initi@@ ators are already registered for the new school year .

software update for diesel vehicles : what consumers have to know now
how exactly can the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
&quot; in the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group software updates are offered for a total of around 5.@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they are intended to improve the emission behavior of cars of the emissions classes Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in of ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the tra@@ ded software updates are optional . &quot;
&quot; the obligatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles , the Schum@@ ann software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the retro@@ fit has arranged the multi @-@ drive federal government ( KBA ) .
how and when are customers informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced a high @-@ level implementation in the next months , but not yet a precise date . &quot;
Daimler has disclosed to write every person concerned .
&quot; if anyway a survey is due , it will be done in their context . &quot;
how long is the change@@ over to go down altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the app@@ endi@@ ces from the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen , we volunte@@ ered to deal with the car manufacturers on the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the retro@@ fit itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
consuming it could be an appointment .
&quot; what do motor@@ cyclists who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE reveals to wait .
&quot; probably foreign manufacturers would go down , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
is now a massive price fall from Euro @-@ 4 @-@ cars ?
the ACE feared this .
&quot; but even in the regions , where the har@@ b@@ inger dro@@ w . &quot;
in rural areas there are so far no losses for older diesel .
&quot; the ACE reveals , with a sale yet to wait . &quot;

we make the city li@@ vable
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , continues next year in R@@ ente . &quot;
the place is already written - suitable candidates are rare .
for 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister
and the work is still great fun as he im@@ par@@ ted in the press meeting .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks which are waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , they won@@ dro@@ us no application to request the requirement profile . &quot;
the city is looking for a architects or engineer for the next possible time .
so - considering the regular termin@@ ations of notice - still enough time for a review .
&quot; since Has@@ l@@ ach acts for the administrative community as a sub @-@ law authority , the applicant must show corresponding conclusions . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; would it no longer be able to fill them out , the citizen should go for advice until Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but the closeness of the city and it itself is important , says W@@ acker , who reported by a good operating climate as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , overlooking the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city li@@ vable , &quot; &quot; he is confident about the ministry and its employees . &quot;
but also in the future varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ cl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the precip@@ itation parking lot are initiated .
the chin bridge between B@@ oll@@ en@@ bach and Stein@@ ach is renewed even the stadium of Sta@@ di@@ re is still subject matter .
&quot; the latter alone will hit the latter with approximately 1.5 million euros to be@@ ech , &quot; if we do it right &quot; , &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all waiting great tasks for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , there is great scope for a Stadt@@ bau@@ chery of great man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot;
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own belly and gar@@ dener could be much flexible in the way .
&quot; you can move a lot &quot; , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of green plants will often be praised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; because the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have an eye for what rein@@ forces , &quot; if new@@ buildings are approved , the ex@@ cre@@ tion Stadt@@ bau@@ chery is emphasized . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ chery is responsible . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; at the end everything goes here over my table . &quot;
&quot; in supporting and coordination , he can count on many years of experience : Markus Neu@@ maier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing this for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep @-@ construction ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really want to identify and stay in place . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working environment but also for the further development of the city .
&quot; who wants to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker , according to information from the city of Has@@ l@@ ach , should provide a completed study as a diploma @-@ engineer or Bachelor with professional architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction projects . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt stand high and deep @-@ construction , construction planning , mo@@ under@@ scoring matters , management of urban properties , urban farm house with Bau@@ hof and Stadt@@ bau@@ chery as well as sub @-@ law authority , including mind@@ set protection . &quot;
bike on cables thrown on : south@@ wards track closed
&quot; according to police , the do@@ ers had previously thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track in the field of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot;
these have been so heavily damaged that the commen@@ cing freight pass had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male bag and look for the night hours after them .
near the resort were witnesses of witnesses a ros@@ ine Rol@@ ler@@ - and a bike riders were observed .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ itz@@ ring road , &quot; said E@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator could have brought himself in a great danger and put them in danger .
&quot; in addition to the damage at the Lo@@ k and the plant , as well as the delays and the costs of the vessel @-@ hand traffic could also come to the perpetrators , too . &quot;
&quot; all in all , be caused by a &quot; substantial &quot; sum , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
&quot; the damages were once again fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south @-@ line track could be guided without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; almost ten persons of persons were on Friday afternoon , two of them consider the television traffic . &quot;
&quot; freight trains fell not out , but they had any delay . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres high @-@ lines had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meats , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( inflammation ) . &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare .
&quot; however , a new study maintains exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition , which affects approximately 1,3 million and in the United Kingdom 300@@ ,000 , causes stomach ul@@ ls and b@@ umps , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while those concerned usually come to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washingtoner University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the intest@@ ine pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food not into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to ign@@ ite inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissues . &quot;
if the balance is too far in the direction inflammation tends to result from an inflammatory disease .
&quot; in experiments , it has been noted that a sort of tolerance conve@@ ying immune cell in mice occurs , which carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their initi@@ ates . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium needs tri@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the components of proteins - to resolve the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a link between a bacterial - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an an Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet also encourages , less infl@@ amed intestinal tum@@ our , when the same system also wir@@ es people . &quot;
&quot; the Post@@ doc@@ torate in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance as she found out that a group of academic grades had such cells , but a different group of the same tribe which was not separated . &quot;
they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ cs of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that usually live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the mice of the mice were decorated to DNA sequences and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells , but without lacking in mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were raised in an ster@@ il@@ ful environment so that they were l@@ acked a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ om , and they did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria played on the immune system , the researchers did grow in a liquid and led then small quantities of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerant cells .
&quot; as the active component of the fluid was cleans@@ ed , it proved as a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism , known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ l@@ actic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the for@@ age of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ ger have been hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cerv@@ antes Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same intolerance @-@ promoting cells such as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal traction . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ side @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i could develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ ger can lead to an increase of this population .
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot;
&quot; at Manchester United , with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , &quot; &quot; Gen@@ ie &quot; , &quot; believes in Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der player on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pounds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game , before the UEF@@ A @-@ super cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday and impres@@ sing in the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Po@@ g@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira after expos@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; however , MA@@ TIC had been excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and only spent 45 minutes , what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had to improve it before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later be ready .
in addition to M@@ atic star@@ ched also Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in the Avi@@ va Stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
&quot; the Independent revealed in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had three further new commitments , but he ins@@ isted that the club has already done a &quot; &quot; fantastic job &quot; &quot; to meet three of his four prime concern . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , for this I thank the club , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happier if they get four of four , but they gave great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US aircraft manufacturer has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers into the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan , and drew up in the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers about the USA , which are several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar shield the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole was an endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already taken such advertising earlier .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing &apos;s logo was painted in the sky .
new lows for Martin Schulz - Hannover - we have a problem
&quot; how the wind rot@@ ates : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel still SPD chief , the Social @-@ Democratic Prime Minister of elections always had a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; only no stor@@ ks from the party central , merely no head@@ wind from the covenant - so the most important wish of the champi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz , the party has changed , has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees watch from the Willy Brandt House with growing the events in the SPD ruling capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , with the head@@ wind would not be described in the approach . &quot;
there were low rainf@@ all .
and one after the other .
&quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Greens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be trusted , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising freight of a Green MP has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
&quot; five months before the elections , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green Managing Director Michael Kellner has prompted the ab@@ re@@ ous low @-@ Sax@@ on Greens El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to return to their mandate .
the Over@@ step to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets must immediately return to their mandate , &quot; said the Federal Minister and Elec@@ toral campaign to the Greens to the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not yet be true , &quot; si@@ ghs a SPD rec@@ ator , when on Friday morning the new Hi@@ obs@@ cur@@ ity Party has reached the party central . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ president of Nieder@@ sachsen , stands after crossing the green MEP El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to CD@@ U without its own government majority . &quot;
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national associations .
and no one knows what next comes .
the Mis@@ ere began with the unexpected defeat in the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med down the comrades . &quot;
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and Nor@@ dr@@ h@@ ein @-@ Westphalia will be anything different .
this then became much worse - and it became much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the di@@ m@@ ness , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ ite Haute the party smooth . &quot;
ti@@ res@@ ome r@@ app@@ led the comrades in the weeks afterwards .
&quot; then , when she had just dra@@ ined new courage , the G @-@ 20 top came from Hamburg . &quot;
and he came with him the next deep attack .
&quot; Mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD state , lost its Nim@@ bus at that weekend because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned . &quot;
&quot; and because he did so pretty much in the crisis communication , what you can do wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z fights for its political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW Ab@@ asi@@ an and his role in the Supervisory Board the Nieder@@ säch@@ sische Prime Minister has already been in criticism for a long time .
mi@@ ese re@@ frac@@ tional values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely , Wei@@ l tried to get stronger in the past weeks ever stronger , in the covenant . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the former mayor of Hanover , his power in Berlin , also remained hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they let him grant it because they spoke to a stabil@@ isation of the party by Wei@@ l .
&quot; now , the exact opposite could occur . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l meets in the party internal constraints , is basically no fault . &quot;
and Schulz was not at all .
&quot; sometimes , the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed towards the Greens , and here especially on the ab@@ out@@ ist parliament@@ arians T@@ v@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ arable and democratic principles , such as Ms T@@ jack@@ ets put their own career interests above the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the Party left in the SPD Parliam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ jack@@ ets is not elected because of her person as a direct candidate , but also on the state list of the lower Sax@@ on Greens , so the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on MEP continues . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD Parliam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ained a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vote of four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l for Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Nieder@@ säch@@ sische SPD as a top candidate in the Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career memory of a future CD@@ U S &amp; D MEP , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he asked to resolve the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there were further commitments to the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen
conve@@ y@@ ance for Ort@@ k@@ ern III
who wants to re@@ ap the house in the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of the city &apos;s urban development on Wednesday in delicate . &quot;
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler had once again given a review of the happ@@ enings .
since 1991 there have been in delicate refurb@@ ishment .
&quot; at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the State of Baden @-@ Württemberg still took over two thirds of the funding . &quot;
&quot; in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still at 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous sanctions are a &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote the inner development , and not just opening new buildings . &quot;
on 4 April one will receive the information provided by the Prime Minister in Karlsruhe that there will be a san@@ itation area III .
&quot; the total amount considered 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which were 500 000 Euros from the country , the rest of the municipality received . &quot;
how is now a refurb@@ ishment ?
&quot; you will continue to study as Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; real old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but it also plays a role , whether in the planned area at all interest , to san@@ e . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the territory can then also post@@ p@@ one another . &quot;
&quot; the jet@@ ty appeared on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal government &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; program , in which framework conditions would then be performed . &quot;
&quot; core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alisation of inner cities , the improvement of living and working conditions and maintenance and expansion of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be object @-@ related , that is called per property . &quot;
the refurb@@ ishment area would then finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the approval period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2017 .
&quot; even until September this year , however , the inventory of the inventory will not be carried out once , as part of those who receive a questionnaire to filling out a questionnaire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the pro@@ posi@@ tional order should be made possible , so that the next year will be started with the refur@@ bish@@ ments . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann declared that any Commune had to perform the said pre @-@ investigations .
&quot; therefore , it is necessary to evaluate and decide the urban planning and to decide when re@@ funded and to what extent . &quot;
it will then also be included in the manual for the respective property .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again once again , and make a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
got@@ hic stressed : an essential success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .
&quot; therefore , the questionn@@ aires will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and property bow &quot; , &quot; in which it is among other things around the construction condition and the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; data can be made to size , division and residents of an apartment . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; arc &quot; &quot; is only to fill out if in the building business premises can be operated . &quot;
&quot; however , in mind , Got@@ zel pointed out that a more fulfilling questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , new measures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler also stressed that the distribution of funding for the &quot; &quot; wind &quot; &quot; principle &quot; &quot; who comes first is ex@@ hor@@ ted first . &quot;
no funding can be reserved for later &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the end the pictures of the project &quot; &quot; Ort@@ k@@ ern II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a reconstruction &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot;
British inventor uses itself a micro@@ chip in order to come with a movement in house and car
&quot; a bri@@ tish inventor is the first in the country that is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his door@@ step , enter his office and even start his car . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ pl@@ anti@@ ed the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and for@@ ef@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory meeting at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standard . &quot;
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ pl@@ anti@@ ated micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am wants to change the locks of houses and cars , so they are compatible with the chip , everything for an extra charge of £ 300 per castle . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now built both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is on the wheel . &quot;
the advertising cost of the White House will cost tax@@ payers thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , to fly a marine helicopter to South La@@ wn for an event that raised the American production in the last month , tax@@ payers will leave the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter @-@ made helicopter was issued next to a yacht from Maine , a fire car from Wisconsin and a for@@ k@@ lift truck from Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in an frag@@ mentary order or F@@ RA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before Hel@@ icop@@ ter landed at South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I only wanted to realize that you are aware of this , because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event his superi@@ ors , the vice @-@ commander of flying for aviation . &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn on July 17th at 7 am at the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 pm and so long stayed until the lawn had been vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
&quot; the note adds that if your flight is delayed from the White House , due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would be required for return flight . &quot;
&quot; the original flight insurance was during the event during the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane . &quot;
&quot; from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether the latter was required for a second flight . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act provides state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked whether the event could inj@@ ure the determination .
&quot; a question we asked was if it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were told that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the President gave an impetus for the reform of health reform that was going on in the Senate , and he set up efforts to susp@@ end governmental rules . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
President are committed to use them for the journey .
but their use only demand for a photo @-@ OP is unusual .
&quot; Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February than the aer@@ op@@ lane in the background of his first Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the air@@ planes through its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy director of the White House , Lin@@ d@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 gar@@ s often lead training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn through to aver@@ t the US President in the White House with precise cuts .
&quot; as a tr@@ ump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House had 58 exercise varieties in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event was in case of training needs for the month , said a be@@ amer . &quot;
Heli@@ kop@@ ter units flew in addition to 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support . &quot;
&quot; the White House said , the tax@@ payers were the burden for none of the other revisions that were presented at the event . &quot;
&quot; said to Si@@ kor@@ sky , the company would not have been involved to put the helicop@@ ters at the South La@@ wn . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget instructions for the presidential @-@ flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Defense Department for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D re@@ plac@@ ements for the v@@ H @-@ 3D is 24@@ 380 USD per flight @-@ hour . &quot;
records of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argued that the actual cost of the operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; to determine the costs of tax@@ payers based on income rates , is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs , which are included in the annual means . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , revenues for DO@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs for fuel , maintenance and contract . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ icer , the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present this week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the federal state , Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for whom so many Americans have worked tirel@@ ess@@ ly .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize this . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether tr@@ ump inter@@ acting with the helicopter , when he joined the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of fire@@ fighters . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and cher@@ ished with the media over its own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of a tricky task
leaders of the Second Tennis Bundesliga enters the table S@@ V at the table of the third Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
the TC blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss starts tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the table of the third Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
&quot; despite five games an even more flaw@@ less record , the leader in the Second Tennis Bundesliga have received the sense of reality . &quot;
team of Mari@@ us Z@@ ay certainly has respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , which is always in quite similar formation . &quot;
straight on the rear positions I find the crew very well . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V , the imports comes from the high north . &quot;
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in the double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view of Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , Mor@@ ör@@ en and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen , as well as Andreas Bj@@ ör@@ hus ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; this is as always hard for us .
you also need a good serving happiness . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white might give max@@ im four .
&quot; at the moment , in the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active French@@ man does not make the Bundesliga game , the tournament is in the Czech Li@@ bere@@ c playful Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) for his first use in this season . &quot;
the so far un@@ defeated Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the white cit@@ rus An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski still at the AT@@ P @-@ tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
&quot; he should be in Kiel , as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ school , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgi@@ ans Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
after his two victories on the last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster also Má@@ t@@ é Val@@ kus@@ z again could go back to the team at Má@@ t@@ é Val@@ kus@@ z .
&quot; it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hung@@ arians who was still number one of the junior world cup in January 2016 , no one fills anyone from the trainer for Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the cad@@ res . &quot;
how America can harm the O@@ MV
&quot; really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump did not , when he put his signature among the law on the ti@@ ghtening of sanctions against Russia . &quot;
&quot; in his capacity to en@@ act the law , the Congress have packed a few &quot; constitutional regulations . &quot; &quot;

Nar@@ cos season 3 tra@@ ilers : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i C@@ art@@ el is at the center of the area of Net@@ fli@@ x
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer revealed , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over . &quot;
the season three and four were already confirmed by streaming service that first received their first trailer and showed the latest Bö@@ se@@ wi@@ gs of the Show .
with the third season the DE@@ A has directed their attention to the richest organization of drug traffic in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell .
&quot; led by four powerful P@@ ets , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une @-@ 500 company &quot; with more state deposits and non @-@ violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ it@@ ela ( Damian Alc@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ it@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is the Mexican link , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly published trailer , Pedro Pascal is returning as Javier Pe@@ ña , the type , the American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs . &quot;
&quot; further new actors are Mati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Sil@@ ves@@ tre , Kerry Bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st .
roll back@@ wards : the town provides 46 kitchen subsidies .
the city organizes the K@@ ita @-@ Mittag@@ table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the urban centres of children the watch will be revers@@ ed .
&quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply chain in the urban centres of children ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ m@@ anz , deputy director in the field of youth aid , this is good news : &quot; &quot; we were all very happy . &quot;
&quot; cooked continues except house : a Cat@@ erer , takes charge of this task and delivers fresh air @-@ cool@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the town operates 46 children &apos;s area in the district of 46 children , and in 44 the children get a warm meal in 44 . &quot;
&quot; the last Kit@@ a@@ Year sat down at 2@@ 800 children at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; by now , not only children who are taken care of 45 week@@ days , in the K@@ ita &apos; mid@@ day , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour support when children stay up to 2 pm .
&quot; 46 sub @-@ time @-@ workers have heating up from 1 September kitchen service : they warm the angel@@ ic foods , supplement them about salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ing the meal individually , give the food off , clean rooms and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group institutions just like seventy @-@ group facilities - decides on the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; so they are much stronger , and it is easier for the cold , educational concepts . &quot;
because that is why it is about healthy eating and cooking .
the children should help prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is therefore useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far the task of the kitchen forces - will in future be done by special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , it also has the charm that it turned out in the cost between equity and foreign currency for the city as the most economical option , is it from the press department . &quot;
and that although 46 sub @-@ time forces are new .
&quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the gu@@ ardi@@ ans range not so strong in weight , &quot; Son@@ ja Pom@@ m@@ anz . &quot;

GM@@ B concerns about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a union would like to have a union on the production of the Bis@@ cu@@ it @-@ producer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow .
GM@@ B Scotland said the company moved over the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the plant that is next to other products hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea cookies .
&quot; at the last few years , Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said , he has invested more than 5 million pounds in the last few years . &quot;
&quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives should be experienced as the first , if their activities were changed . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Fili@@ alle@@ ans of the company called GM@@ B Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to express &quot; &quot; concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be promoted . &quot;
&quot; GM@@ B @-@ Senior Organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity about the needs and investment plans for the future of rab@@ ies , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers are concentrated on the local community and the large rooms of Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ xit , the increasing living costs and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needed a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person on Pla@@ dis said , &quot; The Fili@@ alle@@ ite at T@@ oll@@ ern only received a letter from GM@@ B Scotland and the company will react directly to it , as we value the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and GM@@ B representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed the employees that we operate like all companies that are active in a highly competitive and uns@@ afe economic lim@@ a , our business are constantly checked and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognise the heritage of rab@@ ies as a producer of production and completely at all . should our operations change at the location , employees and their trade union representatives should be the first to experience this . &quot;
has warned the PS@@ G Barcelona three years ago in front of Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the side of La Liga likes their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain did not leave in its persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar , after having issued an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to resolve its open air clause , but they have warned Barcelona three years before the world crash ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , whereby Paul Po@@ g@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after completion , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and for the most paid professional sports@@ men of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GB@@ P per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced his way to outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans Executive Board ins@@ isted that the club has always given its best to take care of him since its arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but the football world was warned three years ago by the PS@@ G @-@ president in front of this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 interested in the signing of the Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any association who would sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players at the sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona does not seem to have passed this line , whereby the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar . &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen report un@@ last@@ eth Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger
the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen report on the abuse of the Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse of the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen provides further discussions .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ sen@@ sing , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; &quot; We are Church , &quot; said to publication from the former Regen@@ sburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; it would greatly serve to the prestige of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would have expressed deep reviews about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false assessment of processes . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; spoke to critici@@ zed that in the coverage of violence at the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen with &quot; &quot; two levels &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in terms of the attacks in Regensburg doubt nobody knows that it would have to be punished and sh@@ ame@@ ful acts , but the &quot; degree medi@@ al manipulation &quot; , &quot; said the &quot; degree medi@@ al manipulation &quot; , &quot; as the author in Lu@@ c@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and Member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit , the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils to describe , is already part of the day @-@ day experience and preparing public opinion that is normal for normal &quot; , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis , in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; we are happy to go on to the church and that is a fr@@ ing@@ es fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; beats a quite normal pedago@@ gic means &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one , finished . &quot;
&quot; they are unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with reports on the mis@@ use cases , the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong , the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who recorded the &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; he adds the results of the final report . &quot;
&quot; what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which was presented by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ voy General Ulrich Weber presented ? &quot;
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in conclusion , it can be noted that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases of physical and psych@@ ic violence have been applied . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment of the students was also severe . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to numerous other allegations , many victims falls on the general humanity by R. and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Ez@@ ra explains why the Final Report on the abuse of the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved of his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ pages report on the &quot; incidents of violence at prot@@ ection@@ ism in the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen &quot; gives a conflic@@ ting picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
for a lift many students make up his &quot; humanity . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tionist who has been tangible , even if a Dom@@ sp@@ atz has not brought top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate as his bi@@ ograp@@ her this final report ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you make the trouble and reads all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one has to ask yourself , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all present at all . &quot;
he is dedicated straight to eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspi@@ cion of intermedi@@ aries or co @-@ workers in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
also the violence at the pre @-@ school occurred outside of its activity .
&quot; it is possible to throw him at all , or have not taken seriously enough of it too late , or not taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ing school , on which he worked , was perceived by practically all the respon@@ dents as - so literally - &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thus also the vast majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was an excellent witness , described him as &quot; warm , &quot; &quot; sincerely , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding &quot; , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers , who cat@@ ered the guys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; always en@@ camp@@ ed by the grapes of children . &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tionist and its high level of emotion@@ ality , which also led to W@@ ut@@ er@@ brü@@ chen . &quot;
&quot; that he didn &apos;t only pe@@ aked with chairs and cast the key@@ hole on the ground , but also ear@@ ly shared with the hair or ears , he gave herself already years ago , deeply de@@ pl@@ orable and exc@@ used for it . &quot;
&quot; to his honor of salvation , however , must be said that such educational methods in the questionable time , the 1960s and 1970s , were widely used , in parents as well as teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think of each one of us born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; also I have seen this in a se@@ cular school , a state @-@ Gymnasium . &quot;
&quot; compared to that , what is actually happening in this report , namely the irre@@ plac@@ eable sexual abuse and violence at the pres@@ ch@@ schule , there are certainly dre@@ at@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; you ask yourself , whether it is not more to do with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media had just stepped onto him . &quot;
&quot; Bav@@ arian Pope began working many , who have never understood him , still eager@@ ly . &quot;
the truth is : the report dra@@ fted Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; in the media , the report was reported very much about the issue of abuse at the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also put any involvement or co @-@ workers in terms of sexual abuse on the load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual attacks claims to become familiar to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to speak with my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; said a person for the others , &quot; It was very embarrassing for me . &quot;
the real problem with clarification of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent from shame .
&quot; if they do not even trust parents and si@@ blings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral manager , who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ator . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a be@@ dent student formed it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... not a case in which he would have had timely findings and could have had the perpetrators of the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd , to assume that there is more urgent or more clear or more clear as compared to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ governance , Trust , etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ thin@@ kable . &quot;
&quot; thus , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; that the student and / or their environment were entrusted to him in advance , could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
what sexual abuse is concerned is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger thus acqu@@ itted of all contribut@@ ors .
&quot; thus , he cannot be accused , to have not prevented him or have brought him to display . &quot;
&quot; therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media was much of &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; with the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was thrown out in the report .
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the coverage everything mixed and mixed up to a giant mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; however , precisely this in turn is a misuse of the report . &quot;
&quot; namely , there will be clean separately : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the g@@ ymnasium of the cathedral , between sexual abuse and violence , we say once , other allegations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report deals from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral conductors . &quot;
&quot; the whole horrible audit pedago@@ gy , the cases in which Kn@@ aben were trans@@ acted by sa@@ di@@ st teachers and mal@@ ign@@ ant , un@@ sett@@ ling on the pres@@ ch@@ schule in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to be ruled . &quot;
&quot; but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when they were already on the cathedral @-@ fir@@ ing school . &quot;
&quot; on the way the most witnesses emphasize , the topic &quot; &quot; pres@@ ch@@ schule &quot; &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; it was just happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment , and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states . &quot;
what was different from the cathedral @-@ minded school ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann , there were already discipline , but is not a sa@@ w@@ ess force . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report comes to conclude that &quot; many victims were estim@@ ating the general humanity by R. and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; thus , at the most still the accus@@ ation remains to have looked at . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported from the states at the pres@@ ch@@ schule . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and was not responsible for the events at a school , which he didn &apos;t want to hear and was responsible ( so the witness ) had nothing to hear , and then again to 1993 . &quot;
crossed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral @-@ bag Gymnasium , which the report was even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this , he points this out , &quot; that she will continue to practice the exam@@ iner in advance . &quot;
&quot; already , given the risk of negative press @-@ raising , he recommended urgent progress . &quot;
&quot; of course , this was at a time when legal clarity was ins@@ isted , as testing was also held in Bavaria too long . &quot;
&quot; before , it occurred in a legal gray area , as each one of us probably still know . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for him to cher@@ ish it , where the affected may be even exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where really the per@@ missible border had been exceeded . &quot;
&quot; however , one cannot say , he had always looked at it . &quot;
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the exam@@ iner in schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria too .
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis , yes , it is unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gic standards to the then time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; &quot; stri@@ ck of the an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger to assess the past of today &apos;s moral principles . &quot;
the princess has already been right .
&quot; of course , this is not true of sexual abuse , which at all times was vile and not for what was broken down in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of resistance and violence against inno@@ cent chil@@ ds , which goes far beyond that at that time . &quot;
this is all terri@@ bly horrible and I am happy that it will finally work .
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means to discipl@@ ining and punishment , i.e. ear@@ ring and to pull in the hair and ears , were widely used in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as physical punishment then banned , he has also kept strictly in it . &quot;
&quot; what image of his Regen@@ sburger Period , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger took place in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
came the subject audi@@ ted to language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ k@@ ts XV@@ I. tells of his perspective , the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I am not at all that he conducted a stric@@ ter reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; but even this must be said once again : without these perfec@@ tionist discipline , without the call for unconditional discipline , it would probably hardly possible to form an institution of world revolution , true cultural message in Europe and his musical tradition , which went twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ y alone one does not even make a big singer and stand before every success , just in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ lap . &quot;
what kind of person have you experienced as Georg R@@ atz@@ inger on talks about their book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition , I have seen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well known and repeat@@ ed@@ ely experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , deep believers and heart@@ felt people , from which one could not imagine that he can do something even just a fly . &quot;
&quot; I get regularly with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen still get in touch with him today , 23 years after his embar@@ go , visit him ; he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who have not for@@ given him to this day , that he once was strictly speaking to them , are therefore clearly in the minority . &quot;
most Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen are grateful to him today that he enriched her life and brought them into the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect , to which they today still look up and to honor them . &quot;
&quot; and please , yet again very clear : everything you pro@@ ach him , are tut@@ orials methods that were on the agenda at that time . &quot;
we can be glad we have overcome this time long ago .
&quot; but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because it is prominent and has a even more prominent brother to make a sc@@ ap@@ sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the nasty intention that is behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eved him . &quot;
&quot; now the dec@@ ency was , a 93 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old man who has earned great merits , and without the outside of Bavaria , and perhaps no one would probably know the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen , finally in peace . &quot;
