<seg id="2">An Irren Anstalt where youth should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A Gruftkapelle which is now buried for the S-Bahn Tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners provide the one-term basis for farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying when landing cards are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">"everybody knows each one who had to exhilarate itself, because the car Navi took place in a green meadow instead of an envelop."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the State government, are anything but up-to-date - but just therefore very enlightening."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread-area of Munich Mercury has changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a makeshical work that one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the great oversight map, for cities and municipalities are more detailed maps, so-called Urpositional datasheets."</seg>
<seg id="13">These emerged according to the Bayeriscation administration between 1810 and 1864 and skipping of the first measurement of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French military guide held Bavaria from the spring of 1800 during the Second Koalitionwar with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted to get an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographical inclusion of Bavaria's order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops marched with the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801, there were today's neighbors that created the idea of a nationwide Bayern-map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" "topographic Bureau" "- and thus the Bayerische Vermessing Management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urpositional sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all the others to be found on the Bayerische National Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of Early / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subverdling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was cancelled 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, as Munich district."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling lies in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses in Lower Saxony focus around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the revolt of Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: in Hindi zooming, a smaller red card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbering from the so-called" "Uruptake", "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots do not occupy there today no farmers - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 Schauch of the October Revolution, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the Urpositional sheet, one reads in the area of today's district of Au-Haidhausen not only the street names" at the guest "" or from the hill "" On the ventilation "" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt." "</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstrasse, there were once people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">There was 1858 / 59 the Munich district of Irrenanstalt on the Auer air.</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard headed by Gudden the institution - the psychiatrist, who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time and ended up, for example, the chains of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he is forbidden to apply the personnel to apply violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen who has engaged in an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"initially, for 280 patients, it was first place, later on 500 places was expanded."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the county seat in hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"there since 2006 the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-east, one of the largest psychiatry in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="40">On the Areal of the former Auer Anstalt we meet young people in Munich's Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order expected the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">"west is the football field of the TSV Munich east, east residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children" "Casa Don Bosco" "was built in architecturally based on the origins of the Irrenanstalt that had been destroyed during the Second World War."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as" main square, "the department store was called" Kaufinger alley. "</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies in December 1944 take many holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big stayed until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business buildings and a Gruftkapelle from the Middle Ages was once the Marienhof, where those days were working on the ground and on 5 April 2017 the spade for the second S-Bahn members."</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider the old Munich map can be compared with the air picture of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group published travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of colored has issued a warning for colorful people based on discriminatory policy and racist attacks of the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel advisory for the federal state of Missouri, who will come into force by 28 August 2017, call special attention to visitors and Missourianists, since a number of questionable, predatory-based incidents in the whole state will occur and here," "says it in the statement of the group."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it people harder to gain discrimination, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state, the disproportionately proportionate to minorities, prompted the group to set out the travel warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of civil rights that humans happen.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin colour, they are assembled or killed," said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency, which we have not heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group quoted as a racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after having had no more gasoline anymore during the journey through the state, and taken by the police of Missouri in custody without a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the General Office of Missouri, in which black drivers in the state will be 75 per cent more common than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be ready to bring any Caution and let the relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri described in 2015 100, hate-hate speech, after the latest figures from the hate-breaking reporting of the FBI, which constituted the state with regard to the number of such injuries on the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">"the time of travel is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to complain a company because of housing or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties (ACLU) Travelling for Texas and Arizona, following the states of immigration laws, committed local law enforcement agencies to conceal people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial legislation."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travelling wares are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent times, stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Pasture project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisbacher Weight fence project is a success project and will be continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliaments Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have created a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the right-grabenhof of the Schwendemann family representatives of the Fisbach CDU local network met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members.</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann granted initial insight into his operations, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk cells and also many young animals, and in five apartments Feriengaeste hosts."</seg>
<seg id="72">"black milk-milk" is for him the alternative marketer path for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste occurs exclusively regionally.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also BLHV chairman of the fisherman, he described the pasture project as" elementary "." "</seg>
<seg id="75">I can act on such steep areas not profitable.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green area care for a lot of work, much must be processed with the engine sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and with the topography," "stressed Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003 he took over the eleventh operation and generated this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he did not conduct bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "the Commune has recognized the meaning of the pasture of wheat, and is pleased with the leader promotion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">One hope that the reforestation of surfaces could be brought up for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure we have, are the people working in agriculture and make thoughts of how they continue their operations," "stressed the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion of funding</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure area is 40 hectares that can not be stopped until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">"the total cost of 71 500 euros was funded half by leaders, a quarter contributed to the town of Fisbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers left 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pastures."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," declared Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and women, it does not go."</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter white stood firm:" "here best food is produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscapery (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state promotion of wheat-coated.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Schwarzwalds.</seg>
<seg id="93">The condition is the presence of one of the LPR-recorded conveyisse.</seg>
<seg id="94">"moreover, the invigorous surface must not be shly contemptible (Hanging over 35 percent) and therefore must be threatened by the recovery."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the fisherman Weidiscreet project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build approximately 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure of 35 hectares, the Calabrian costs are more than 112 000 Euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty in front of</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime transfer is it when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he took a symbolic Axt in a hitant dispute with Jim Acosta on the proposals of the president to the drastic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imitators would have denied him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he attacked their importance, and in particular the meaning that it was written, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus, was 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base was added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"to Miller Acosta:" "I don't want to go down here to a full thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that the world illuminated."</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you refer to later was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is correct properly, but as he himself formulated it, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about contemporary resonance on the upright words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state will not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" "your exhausted, your poor, / your suppressed masses that would like to breathe free, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "miserable waste" on our screen was better to see.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not devise himself in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural struggle: it is in fact a conflict in the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who put themselves in place to place their words after her death at the base - knew very well that they have taken a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by showing the female embodiment of freedom in a fully exploited.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminine coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and precisely how Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, people wanted to switch from the right wing this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the big scribe, Rush Limitgh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty no one drawer but rather an early neo-conservative was that the American flame is in the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty is proceeding. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It is intended to carry the Fackel of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The Fackel is not supposed to enlighten the way to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">Rather unusual is Limbaugh here on something hit.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely at all a matter of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted of Lazarus to see them as they were seen from the exhausted, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump will ever recognise.</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not enlighten the way, but the hatred, which is their only source of power, ignite."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championships 2017: Neil Black lorazed members of the UK's team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle reminds itself of a time when only two scots belonged to the team of Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="130">"the director of the athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Congress of the World Championship has a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes selected for London 2017 that starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that in Scotland something special develops and the athletics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue until we find it," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think there is something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think there is something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy on the corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butovo - which will compete against Sir mon Farah on the 5,000 m stretch, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to the team member."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eelidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"her captain's speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were shoottically or wherever they live or train, went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feel that Eilidh was totally natural, were magnificent."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth of silver medal, who will compete in their fifth World Championships in the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" incredible "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015. "</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-range Muir Muir leads on this path and has put up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runners."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, the 1.500 m is running, is another Scotsman which one should look after a great season that included victory at the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers its first World Championships as the only other Scotsman in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the Mannestry captain says that they are" hugely proud "to the fact that many of their countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases also join the medals and the Finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special about this team captain came to be in it that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour, but to know that my team-mates voted for me and have chosen, makes it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the villi who belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes, who want to rise on Podies."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech concerns as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back in the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go there and compete, and it will be so a great atmosphere out there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking critic on Facebook: Beverb not a public office if you cannot tolerate the heaters of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last long until the newspapers struck him because of all, from domestic politics to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he smashed in criticism, safe."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not have his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783 Washington said," "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we will lead the sheep to the slaughtering."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to governor Larry Hogan, who must work on it to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinions on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties promised him this week in the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the rod of the governors sent the lawsuit as a frivol, and the line comment was full of a counter-reaction with" "Na, and?." "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a republican governor in a overwhelming democratic state, which is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the two-ranking approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as the primary instrument to disconnect with its voters and to debate his haarless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blockage of persons who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum that is called officially and paid by employees who are paid by public tax-Dollars - unnecessary, and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan Specherin Amelia Chasse the actions of the Governors and argued that the blockade of comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hwater-filled people, which vibrate online the whip."</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said their comments are respectful, thoughtful and not profound."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic Faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer's Lakshmi Sarma Ramani by Bowie, Md., was not hwater-filled, but she asked to break hate."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate hate and other latest news," wrote them in the commentary area of the news release "" The Post. "" "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are misunderstood by some rather than so-called collective action and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the employees of the governors referred to as" "concentrated spam attack", "others would probably call" intercetic. ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by removing a critic, or deleted a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same thing that employees have been sent to gather newspapers with critical heads and to burn or burning protesters, and to silence."</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is precisely what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complained by Twitter-users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question coincided last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the chairman of the Board of Supervisors, Loudoun County expelled the First Amendment, according to the U.S. District of James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they proclaimed a voter from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bein (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at present, Washington's time had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiply between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous briefs smashed on his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had an anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people, used pseudonyme such as" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius "wrote all letters to newspapers, which made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, which criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and navigation with Great Britain, overwhelm his office, according to historical documents collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not have them silenced.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of expression, opinion of opinion and discourses belong to the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true guidance means to accept that.</seg>

<seg id="1317">The big living lives: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrunk from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex at Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">"this apartment was shown in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1323">I love me in her and made an offer on this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first viewing, the 1,000 square feet had been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">"originally a one-room estate with a dawned layout, you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne's storage space and a mezzanine to make the generous ceiling height."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, plenty of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"this was my requirement," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development but also a place to live for joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms in one another, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the submission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel plant is rather complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were overthrown over, without having to wipe ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the top or at the bottom."</seg>
<seg id="1334">"this arrangement allowed it to place Erfan, two rooms in full height - with a lot of extra drama."</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine looks a classic copper window from retrouvius via the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold moebel, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">On both ends there is a short corridor mirrored to let him take longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirroring looks like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance mirrored units place space for all the bridle and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in," explains Erfan from the stahlreinforced, veneered MDF-door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is very important, so that if you push the door open, very easy to guide."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could win extra 16 m ², an extra bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the base, or how your property is valued," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a vestigial shape, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they managed to enlarge the floor space while using high quality materials, which gives space to its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and who therefore help create an emotional relationship in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not love yourself into the electric plugs in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>

<seg id="1581">"if NGOs not submit a new code of code, it is difficult to see how they can work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turiner daily La Stampa. "</seg>
<seg id="1582">"Minnitis warning came one day after the Italian authorities had seized upon a boat of the German aid organization 'Youth Rettet," because their team had worked effectively with traffickers in a manner which facilitated the illegal immigration. "</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organization, which has only been in operation for one year, declined it to express themselves in detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor of Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the salvation of human life remains our top priority. so we are sorry that we cannot operate at the moment in search and rescue zone," said the organisation in an opinion on social media. "</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can judge all accusations, which are currently raised, only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>

<seg id="1589">"the occupation is dained by authority of the authority of the Italian coastal guard, who monitors the bailout rates in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motivations."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the conduct of conduct, boats like the Iuventa must mainly have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations, have so far been prepared to keep up the code: save the Children, MOAS of Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules were regarded as unnecessary, but acceptable as they wouldn't bring any" significant changes or disability "of their bailouts."</seg>

<seg id="1594">"Minniti said in the meantime, that the number of migrants agreed upon bailout measures in Italy came greatly in the past few weeks, which suggests the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguards and working with the local civil servants."</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the Weekly Riodoce usually meet in order to review their plans for the reporting of the latest chaos in Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and unceaseless drug wars. "</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">It has been told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure: they are supposed to take their children to the office, which in 2009 were the goal of an attack with granite, or at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"safety experts have written three words to a table at the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the Reporter, names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug addicts, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspicion to stand on the secret list of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest period from violence, and while throughout the country the bodies of corpses are increasing: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took place in December 2012. 589 are standing after attacks and threats under Bundesschutz and until now there was at least seven deaths in seven countries this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, their editors and their inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"its absence is felt deep even though his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, which shows its medium-finger with the word" Justice ", hanging t-shirts in the mid-12 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the porters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, its nightmare, insomnia, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although in 2010, a Sonder-Federal Office was built to edit the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of killers who are linked each year with drug stores and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely put on trial."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"in Riodoce, they still insist on the violence of Sinaloa while they are uncloudy and even though the terrain is now in stock."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting concerning the discussion of security has little benefits, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to squander my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we know not the Why, we mistrust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla has been stopped by two men. he was forced from his car and 12 times was shot at him, presumably due to the name of the newspaper - the" Twelded River. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly in Culiacan free to fly.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest in the past year and delivery in the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, since rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of missed, two-story Mausoleen for drug royalty, which are bigger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget for a minute that there is a state of" tranquility, "if only a cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February the publication of a interviews with Damaso Lopez, a leader of the rivaling cartels in the war with Guzmans sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may be annoyed the sons, suspected gangmembers bought each copy of the issue, as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kioske."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second error was to force Valdez, not to force according to the confiscation of another newspaper which has published the same story to leave the country to its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues won that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was active in 2003 as an experienced reporter for Noroeste as he joined the founding of Riodoce in 2003 and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa, it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the crawry problem," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1847">"at the time, the newspaper served a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising revenue."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved it to publish hard-wise investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize "for their reporting in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuit of the Mexican drug history, wherever it brought."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue" "he said at the time of the CPJ distinction."</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trade in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV in October last October."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take the task that you as a journalist falls - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I would not like to be asked:" "what did you have done in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team miss Valdez, the spawning-bird, who was like a harbour worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trusted on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guaynabo, the bar across from the office, and always sitting there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now, ask her: was his love for routine his destruction?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also has forced them to question their own assumptions on how to get their work best, and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it if you are dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runway and cross-ways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, you keep away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that" smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier has happened. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer considered in Sinaloa, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lucrative smugglers, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the employees met Riodoce for safety training, suddenly there were no mobile phones allowed. days before has been known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, for monitoring journalists and activists living in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside two policemen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the national government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters were asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen, which the governor itself was not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago, since the reporters have gone into the mountain scenery, where drug gangs are under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has alded on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the government spending which focused on the hometown of the Governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"there was a group contained in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the Prosecutor's office, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local retailer and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"reporter of public records, that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy leader, who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (Pri), who ruled almost the whole century all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several Pri governors have been accused because of high-quality cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this pub, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman got a military overfall."</seg>
<seg id="1883">Just a few months before the reader had seen the column of Valdez as the best informed source about kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"in the past we had already knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "" El FLACO "" because of his slender body stats. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez was devoted to storage space for signs and stickers who protest against the murders of journalists, because the staff have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">"on the Ramirez Miriam Ramirez, a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist for the office of the Prosecutor."</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA testing that it is his."</seg>
<seg id="1890">"in the whole country, journalists have become stronger, having been written in organized" SOS Press "on walking paths and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, the director of Bojorquez is gone in Washington and tried to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the Governor of Sinhala on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities, journalists and bring them around because they told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has been asked that she was once again divided by the government, because it is concerned that their anger has violated their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez has repeatedly told that journalists in Mexico by organised crime, involved in government officials and a simultaneous society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs but also on command of politicians and security guards which have organised crime under a ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"in the past year, the media" Articulo 19 "has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials in the past year."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico-minded you give, because they would like you keep the mouth," said Ramirez. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"your body was signed together with a note that was supposedly signed by the Zetas de Kartell:" "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer-stats and earphones located next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">"some stores have chosen to close, like the newspaper El Norte at the northern border of Chihuahua according to the assassination of the correspondents Miroslava Breach in March."</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do as it did El Manana from Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of their director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez made public attention to the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the title "What do you want from us?</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists are fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they will be hunted, as it was obviously murdered by the photographer Ruben Espinosa, which was killed in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"to those who stay back and continue working, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be poets, gives us that the drug trade is scared him."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and so I was reporter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat down before the office and drank beer, than once all their phones began to be summoned."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of slips with Bandreefs and security guards near the bathortes Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war escalated continues as promised by a series of Kartell messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the on-board stone, they released the news on the website of Riodoce on mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens heats close to - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez gave a look at the policemen. the guards held to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">If they were afraid they did not showed it.</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the powerful portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose Central finger was visible for the whole Sinhala, the staff of Riodoce followed its mark."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you also only think about it," said Bojorquez, "if on the same day, on which Javier was murdered, the practicant asked me to send them to reporting on the road."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to soften its enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">At first sight it looks like a statue if also a terrifying.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"now researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible nascent of a Canadian mountain workers have been so well received, that experts have described it as" Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs "." "</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so good that they could even notice that his love of reddish-like Braun was - and they said, they would have had something from a" troubled past. ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" Current Biology "recorded it as" the termed-termed dinosaurs that has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">Fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosauaurs that lived in the middle of the chalk between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his unbelievably well preserved state has researchers, who describe it as" really remarkable ","</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant-eaters is the best preserved fossil food of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he was on 21 March 2011 at Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something, out of the surrounding rock was missing, and decided to see more exact."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1.100 kg) heavy earth."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only see a little with the eyes blinking, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is visible. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs, the Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this plant-eaters, although it is covered with an armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by meat and send dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage in order to hide from predators, and used a parachutibility that is used as a countercase, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed to mix better in its surroundings and soften its enemies, say experts, which suggests that there was threatened by greater dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaur has made headlines in May and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the Museumsteker Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the astounding preservation of the specimen allowed it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of scales and armor through his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shaded, a widespread defence method in wildlife, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shaded is common, the results are surprising since the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaurs were hunted by enough pressure by flesh, and the dinosaurs that the evolution favored the wear of the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of the most contemporary animals, which use the counter-shaded - think of deer, zebras or girders - are much smaller and vulnerable as a prey, which signaled that this Nodosaur was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behavior on a massive, strongly armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators have been to have been the chalk-time", "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skals also shows that the skin of the dinosaur. brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal on references about his life, including his labour-fourth intestines to find out what it had eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, driven into a river and was driven out into the sea where he sunk on the back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta has been as warm as Südflorida today, and rivers and oceans most likely more widespread than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaur is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with consistent skin, but also in three dimensions remains and the original form of the animal retains," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal is almost as similar today as in the early chalk time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you just have a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it is at bedtime."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time when huge Theropoden, carnivorous dinosaurs that were standing on two legs, the earth crossed."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them lived, the tyrannosaurus Rex, millions of years after Borealopelta lived, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his furious ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons heavier monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta has been versed after death in the sea and in the mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was on 21 March 2011 at Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum it is the termed-termed dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3.000 pounds (1.300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch-long tips that razed by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armored crop-eaters have been mapped by the Western Canada, until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the underwater ascent of the dinosaurers keep his armor in exquisite detail."</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still bumpy eplings along the dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as' rare as a profit in the Lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confusing it gets."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy tank plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers crossed upwards."</seg>

<seg id="1989">And then: pufff.</seg>
<seg id="1990">"comes the creation, and wakes up an unsurft or strikes the driving force in the middle of the workflow."</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of breaks are soon over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the creator-card control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">One simply confirms the phone that you have taken his place and thus devaluated the ticket.</seg>

<seg id="1999">"in order to be able to use, however, some requirements need to be met: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - which is already the most passengers to do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"you must also have bought it via the app, the DB navigator, which is anyway the most convenient way of ticket sales."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And finally one needs a seat reservation.</seg>

<seg id="2010">"it enables the passengers to shape their travel time in the train of personal," says Michael Peterson, Marketing-Management of DB Fernandes. "</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second plus: "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"who often goes, knows that besides delays and passivly the ticket controls are to the biggest health conditions."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"because often, in any case one of the fellow travelers do not have all the documents that you need for devaluation of online tickets."</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"just one day after they arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis, on the bed of an Airbnb apartment, which they rented and scrolling through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled across a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year child, and it is still on the street," it was called there. "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, because no one had posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., who was killed, live live."</seg>
<seg id="2027">"he posted a picture of browns lebloated body, stretching on the street and would stay there four hours."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," thought Ferrell. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She placed her cell phone later to return to Tweet via people on the Canfield drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people, crying, and by a man who claimed to be Browns father, who contributed a sign with the inscription:" "Ferguson police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">They watched a live feed at which a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a bellish dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, rejected a different policeman his rifle, and cried:" I will kill you... animals all kill. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," Ferrell recalls her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can typically call.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a return trip and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock, she fetched her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? "," in the cinemas from the 11. "</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and Protestants, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consist of the vision of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as a Ferrell with her daughter who carried a flower dress and a suitable crown, after Ferguson, the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black condition. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for that, what they believe in?" "she reminded of what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we go to Ferguson, because the police have killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take them," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">She has to know and see it and be reared in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the luck to give her an experience, in which they personally experience no ecclant racism, she is no different than the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would prove to be a bad service to keep them away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a location opposite the police authority that became a campground as the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">There was Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets before and halves they pass on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to accept a new type of activism for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has been totally altered after 9 August, she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"" "I had no experience in organizing."</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the film-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to document" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came from Ferrell in the meaning:" "do you document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"these skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often from whites in a community that benefited from her sorrow and its resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"how Folayan said recently in an interview:" "we heard that people born in Ferguson and grew up, their voices are not centered and we wanted to make it different."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan already worked together with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field, known for its activism around Todestrakt."</seg>
<seg id="2064">His engagement brought the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns Ershod.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not somebody who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak," Davis said. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"this was the main thing for me as these people are represented, because I will be shown."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferryells' experience - to show that it is the movement" not about an Messiah, but "said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrer's life, as she loves to love and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I have understood that there must be certain vulnerability during this work, and when the dehumanization of black people must give a certain vulnerability."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferris history repeated the role of the black swam women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killing of the black teenager trayby Martin in 2012 have shaped the film" "BlacklivesMatter" "in social media, identify as sponul."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in executive positions have carried the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must wear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to notice that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women.</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it is based on that" "this is not a affirmative type of action," in which Ferrell was selected due to their identity as a heart of the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who stirred up this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence, although she was at the forefront, because in a life on these crosses as a black, gay woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel your energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile the news cameras in Ferguson have long gone, but the racial connections between the church and the police remain."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on the currency for 2 ½ years because of the blockage of a highway in a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the social policy atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "a mess.</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, they cled themselves to a singing and she feels committed to that memory since three years ago she went into Ferguson on the streets three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">"" "it is our duty to fight for our freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">"dream" "to" "size" ": TV-readers discuss about bit-gallery"</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves the people, although it has not been built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"but the idea of a shopping centre at the south-end of the pedestrian zone, divides the population into advocates and opponents."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the subject hardly leaves one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">On our Facebook page "People & Bitburg" the topic is discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while one can say to the bit-gallery:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be real class "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" "does not need a human" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply, "" Orasahn! "" (Lars Scholz). "</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while proponents have built that a gallery will attract more customers to the city, of which the rest of them benefit, fear the opponents of the pedestrian streets."</seg>
<seg id="2095">Added: the gallery will be exactly planned on the property on which the market hall is available in the 13 Governing market.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the start of construction work will be the end.</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the Galerie makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building, while Beda-Square, with possibility to sit outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been selling almost every week in the farmer's market for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country are always happy to be very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Gerd Densing:" "whether the direct market in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the height of the rent."</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, it is likely to be very low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what shopping spots in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothes, shoes, dryers or supermarkets: I find it unnecessary."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You see how many shoppers can be empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but there is not even a decent weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall will remain intact."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly from the producer and is above-purely inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, Ladin stores will be located in a shopping center only by larger companies, as the dorms are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special businesses there is almost no more and what still remains of it, will probably even disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping center with a market hall does not fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where is the farmer's market during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even if the bit gallery will eventually occur.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it create the specs bit-gallery before to expel all shops from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "this is simply not working.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, does not need any one."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion it would have been better to have a real farm market place, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a peasant market hall, it's up to many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg is no place anymore."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmers market hall is taken, a piece of culture will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost invisible, that hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the Artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Hammedos that were sent to her from Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth where the former secret service analyst took a 35-year prison sentence after they publicly proclaimed diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks site.</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Stblance (A suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was united in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transwife and groundbreaking disco, whose conviction was turned by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithms analysis of the DNA that could be extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, such as someone with these genomic data might look like, even if something intellectual comment could not only be interpreted by the formability of DNA data - the many ways of how they can be interpreted and the hardening determinism of this interpretations, but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already been committed to identification as a woman since her puberty, including six violations of the SpionageAct, Computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in prison, her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a baskets, black-white selfie, in which Manning is clearly sitting on a driver's seat and carries a platinblonde pearl - with whom it was associated with."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of its 2012 project "Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"it produced the artist portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette smoke and chewing gum, extract the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," stated Dewey-Hagborg in a press release of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not be visited at this time, and she could not be photographed, so she took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated muse were sent to unequal corrections over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of the Shoili canungo illustrated Comic" Suppressed Images, "which would foresee a future in which the President Chelation would convert judgment, and she would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama is actually only a few days after the book was released, Manning release would demand for seven brutal years in a military coup in Kansas, was a welcome way of happy meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something lowland and Starkes, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against Transformative troops to find new, tweet ways that he actually should fix, continue to flout."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen to happen on a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of the gallery on the written artistic statement, Manning called with their overlarge signature including (the" "i" "in her family name) is an end to the" automatic defragmentation, whose foundation may have been gender, racial, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandwich of Cs and Gs and As, in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped, through the inclusion of the 200 characters (or nuclear otide after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), how amazing, at least in biological things, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hopefully will take with it is that our genome is not about who we are and how openly genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell as many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, kept in a separate room, is one side of the above comic Novelle mentioned above."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"she shows Manning, how it appears with a free prediction in hand from the disciplinarity of the United States as King Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they speak your speech, they have won," "says it."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so do never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," "said the Artist that greeted from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get gearing, when I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it predicted in the comic book - but if they should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, which collapsed as hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also targeted, as everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), in which their genetic Haplogins were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it feels like a mass movement that feels formed with Chelsea, like the movement, which also hidden behind its liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"however, a new study maintains exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition, which affects approximately 1,3 million and in the United Kingdom 300,000, causes stomach ulls and bumps, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while those concerned usually come to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washingtoner University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the intestine patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food not into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are able to ignite inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in the direction inflammation tends to result from an inflammatory disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experiments, it has been noted that a sort of tolerance conveying immune cell in mice occurs, which carry a certain bacterium in their initiates."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs triyptophan - one of the components of proteins - to resolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a link between a bacterial - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an an Tryptophan rich diet also encourages, less inflamed intestinal tumour, when the same system also wires people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the Postdoctorate in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance as she found out that a group of academic grades had such cells, but a different group of the same tribe which was not separated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbics of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract. "</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the mice of the mice were decorated to DNA sequences and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells, but without lacking in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were raised in an sterilful environment so that they were lacked a intestinal microbiom, and they did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria played on the immune system, the researchers did grow in a liquid and led then small quantities of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"as the active component of the fluid was cleansed, it proved as a by-product of the tryptophan-Metabolism, known as Indol-3-lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the forage of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophanger have been halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes Barragan explained that people have the same intolerance-promoting cells such as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal traction."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-side-products from L. reuteri could develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said:" "the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophanger can lead to an increase of this population.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report unlasteth Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse of the Pope Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weissensing, spokesman of the reform movement" "We are Church," said to publication from the former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-year-old Benedict XVI, an apology. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would greatly serve to the prestige of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would have expressed deep reviews about their own omissions or their then false assessment of processes."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican" "Osservatore Romano" "spoke to criticized that in the coverage of violence at the Domspatzen with" "two levels". ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"in terms of the attacks in Regensburg doubt nobody knows that it would have to be punished and shameful acts, but the" degree medial manipulation "," said the "degree medial manipulation", "as the author in Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and Member of the national Italian Bioethics committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit, the Catholic Church as a source of all evils to describe, is already part of the day-day experience and preparing public opinion that is normal for normal", "writes Scaraffia."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis, in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" we are happy to go on to the church and that is a fringes frescoes. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth" "beats a quite normal pedagogic means" "to be done with cheeky children, as I was one, finished."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"they are unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with reports on the misuse cases, the Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrong, the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who recorded the" "My brother of the Pope" "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "" for all this had nothing to do with him, "" he adds the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">"what exactly is in the 440-page report, which was presented by the Bistum Regensburg with the Envoy General Ulrich Weber presented?"</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s," "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" in conclusion, it can be noted that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases of physical and psychic violence have been applied. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotionality, the punishment of the students was also severe."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"in contrast to numerous other allegations, many victims falls on the general humanity by R. and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Ezra explains why the Final Report on the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was relieved of his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-pages report on the" incidents of violence at protectionism in the Regensburger Domspatzen "gives a conflicting picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">For a lift many students make up his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he appears as a choleriker and perfectionist who has been tangible, even if a Domspatz has not brought top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as his biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you make the trouble and reads all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one has to ask yourself, why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all present at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated straight to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of intermediaries or co-workers in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the violence at the pre-school occurred outside of its activity.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"it is possible to throw him at all, or have not taken seriously enough of it too late, or not taken seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzenging school, on which he worked, was perceived by practically all the respondents as - so literally -" "salvation", "" "heaven" "and" "better world". ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"thus also the vast majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger was an excellent witness, described him as" warm, "" sincerely, "" competent "and" understanding "," as extremely good-natured teachers, who catered the guys with cakes, biscuits and Bonbons and "always encamped by the grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complained about his perfectionist and its high level of emotionality, which also led to Wuterbrüchen."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he didn't only peaked with chairs and cast the keyhole on the ground, but also early shared with the hair or ears, he gave herself already years ago, deeply deplorable and excused for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his honor of salvation, however, must be said that such educational methods in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, were widely used, in parents as well as teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think of each one of us born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"also I have seen this in a secular school, a state-Gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to that, what is actually happening in this report, namely the irreplaceable sexual abuse and violence at the preschschule, there are certainly dreatry."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"you ask yourself, whether it is not more to do with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media had just stepped onto him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"Bavarian Pope began working many, who have never understood him, still eagerly."</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report drafted Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, the report was reported very much about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger in the final report also put any involvement or co-workers in terms of sexual abuse on the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual attacks claims to become familiar to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to speak with my father or mother about it," "said a person for the others," It was very embarrassing for me. "</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with clarification of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent from shame.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they do not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral manager, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrator."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen student Ratzinger's role in regard to abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a bedent student formed it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... not a case in which he would have had timely findings and could have had the perpetrators of the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd, to assume that there is more urgent or more clear or more clear as compared to their parents, internatsgovernance, Trust, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus, the report comes to the very clear result:" that the student and / or their environment were entrusted to him in advance, could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse is concerned is Georg Ratzinger thus acquitted of all contributors.</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus, he cannot be accused, to have not prevented him or have brought him to display."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflicting crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media was much of" "violence" "with the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger was thrown out in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the coverage everything mixed and mixed up to a giant melange of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"however, precisely this in turn is a misuse of the report."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, there will be clean separately: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the cathedral, between sexual abuse and violence, we say once, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report deals from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral conductors."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole horrible audit pedagogy, the cases in which Knaben were transacted by sadist teachers and malignant, unsettling on the preschschule in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states have to be ruled."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they were already on the cathedral-firing school."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on the way the most witnesses emphasize, the topic" "preschschule" "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">"it was just happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment, and for many even" heavenly "states."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the cathedral-minded school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann, there were already discipline, but is not a sawess force."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report comes to conclude that" many victims were estimating the general humanity by R. and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories with it. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"thus, at the most still the accusation remains to have looked at."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported from the states at the preschschule."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and was not responsible for the events at a school, which he didn't want to hear and was responsible (so the witness) had nothing to hear, and then again to 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Crossed Georg Ratzinger consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral-bag Gymnasium, which the report was even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this, he points this out," that she will continue to practice the examiner in advance. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already, given the risk of negative press-raising, he recommended urgent progress."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"of course, this was at a time when legal clarity was insisted, as testing was also held in Bavaria too long."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before, it occurred in a legal gray area, as each one of us probably still know."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult for him to cherish it, where the affected may be even exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible border had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"however, one cannot say, he had always looked at it."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the examiner in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis, yes, it is unfair to apply today's pedagogic standards to the then time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the" "strick of the anachronism," so the danger to assess the past of today's moral principles. "</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"of course, this is not true of sexual abuse, which at all times was vile and not for what was broken down in the preschool of resistance and violence against innocent childs, which goes far beyond that at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all terribly horrible and I am happy that it will finally work.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger, for all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means to disciplining and punishment, i.e. earring and to pull in the hair and ears, were widely used in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as physical punishment then banned, he has also kept strictly in it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what image of his Regensburger Period, Georg Ratzinger took place in the talks with you for the book" "My brother of the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the subject audited to language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedikts XVI. tells of his perspective, the Domspatzen played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I am not at all that he conducted a stricter regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must be said once again: without these perfectionist discipline, without the call for unconditional discipline, it would probably hardly possible to form an institution of world revolution, true cultural message in Europe and his musical tradition, which went twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and bony alone one does not even make a big singer and stand before every success, just in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overlap."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person have you experienced as Georg Ratzinger on talks about their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition, I have seen Georg Ratzinger really well known and repeatedely experienced as wonderful, humorous, deep believers and heartfelt people, from which one could not imagine that he can do something even just a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regularly with how many former Domspatzen still get in touch with him today, 23 years after his embargo, visit him; he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who have not forgiven him to this day, that he once was strictly speaking to them, are therefore clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he enriched her life and brought them into the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respect, to which they today still look up and to honor them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, yet again very clear: everything you proach him, are tutorials methods that were on the agenda at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is highly unjust, a man, just because it is prominent and has a even more prominent brother to make a scapscapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the nasty intention that is behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, relieved him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the decency was, a 93-year-year-year-old man who has earned great merits, and without the outside of Bavaria, and perhaps no one would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
