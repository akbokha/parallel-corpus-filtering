Jennifer An@@ iston : I will always put in drawers
Jennifer An@@ iston must not always be perfect or successful .
this has made clear the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ambiguous .
&quot; I will always put it in drawers , or get fro@@ sted from the outside label , who have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
&quot; I do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; honestly speaking , these things are rather car@@ eless . &quot;
Jennifer An@@ iston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is regarded as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as it explains in the current Cos@@ m@@ opolitan magazine .
&quot; at the dearest time , the act@@ ress spends her time at home , pre @-@ television with lo@@ cker@@ em D@@ utt and mex@@ ican food , says it in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; now she is the question of the desire for child desire : &quot; &quot; we do not have to be married or have children to be completely &quot; , &quot; so the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new film &quot; mother &apos;s Day - love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; is An@@ iston as a single mother of two sons to see .
the film runs on us from August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sport@@ pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a bit with a few colleagues with a ride on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses reminded themselves of their celebrations , they j@@ umped in fast g@@ allo@@ p to the for@@ age . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I am afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and this ended the riding career then again .
on Saturday Germany was best gol@@ fers of all times - 101 tournament wins - again near horses .
&quot; he allowed himself to carry out his family about the facility of AL@@ RV , on a horse , he didn &apos;t have a photograph for himself for photo purposes . &quot;
the first time in Aachen and therefore also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Spor@@ thilfe passed the man from An@@ hausen in a small gala into the Golden Sport@@ pyramid .
on awards it lacks the sympathetic athle@@ te .
&quot; Bundes@@ finan@@ ci@@ z , sil@@ ber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour of the Year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already dressed him .
a long is the 18th winner of the sports pyram@@ ide .
&quot; at Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; this award means me a lot , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring .
&quot; and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time Master@@ V@@ winner was recorded on Saturday in the Hall of Fame of the German Sports . &quot;
&quot; the Un@@ known Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Sch@@ mit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ ese , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ rival Sch@@ mit@@ t , the Ru@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Spring@@ leader Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand@@ craft . &quot;
many of these sports@@ men had come to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustr@@ ative Society emigr@@ ated to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za price ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a distance to the great animals .
Clin@@ ton and trac@@ umps in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the trade deal at T@@ TP - we want both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two US presidential elections are however on the tax and energy policy as well as in a base question . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a prin@@ cipl@@ ed , more philosophical difference . &quot;
the role of the state .
&quot; tr@@ ump wants to keep a small size in doubt and warns that , as the state of economy can harm , with taxes and regulations . &quot;
Clinton wants to raise the economy to death and regulate death he says .
&quot; on the other hand , he would be quite different , claiming a tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely return the regulations , and it makes for a wide @-@ ranging tax reform with lower tax practices - for individuals and for businesses . &quot;
Clinton said to him : the state has certain tasks to fulfill he has disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it .
&quot; therefore , the taxes would be increased to the rich , it says . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost wor@@ e . &quot;
the Democratic App@@ lic@@ in announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
&quot; state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies , and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ap@@ y wing of the re@@ public@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; so on Tr@@ ump , you could also send a party internal discussion . &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policies are clearer .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ power plants and drive up the coal mining in the USA .
&quot; oil production is to be possible also in so far protected areas , the Paris climate agreement wants to announce . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly strengthen the renewable energies with their investment programme : &quot; a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be China , Germany or America - I want we are . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ fish trade agreements , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the US do not want to isol@@ ate the U.S. from international trade - but just want to better protect American jobs . &quot;
the should then also be better paid for around Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a famine .
she wants to increase it on 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump will do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to go , then he says he should not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump is standing , which aims to rel@@ ieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics hold on to him , so that the budget deficit would be even greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand Clinton is , who wants to ask at least from the rich that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every swe@@ eping woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is one of women who fled alone , almost in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
each baby has a baby that is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in the arm .
he will be curious with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother wins on the table top .
until they noticed that it is observed .
they smile short and kis@@ sing the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; it is the management guide of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria , and is concerned with the subject of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen were found .
they live in Munich &apos;s north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ ated accommodations for single women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs took place together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich &apos;s Women &apos;s Aid relief .
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - even not as visitors .
the exception is a wa@@ ist in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has done on her escape experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee for wars because they are pro@@ secuted politically , because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them as hop@@ eless@@ ness to Europe &quot; , &quot; she tells . &quot;
&quot; in women they weigh other reasons for the escape : &quot; many ste@@ al secretly , because they see no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced marriages , honorary , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is driving them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs demand for example for a bottle of water a sexual act , is not uncommon , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not being protected by their families .
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they are ank@@ ering in Germany , tells us danger . &quot;
&quot; even here , all the women in refugees would often be considered inferi@@ or and worse . &quot;
&quot; this leads to that about 90 percent of women staying in the north of Munich city , traumati@@ sed them . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not optional . &quot;
many women are so accustomed to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too great . &quot;
&quot; as they often do not help to help , more accommodations need more accommodations for them , call for danger . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven District governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the question whether or not they knew by a similar project like in Munich , in their jurisdiction , answer some with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is something like the governments of the governments . &quot;
&quot; also in Schw@@ aben are not separated alone , Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ person of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken , there are some common shel@@ ters or houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two main accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
also the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separately from men .
&quot; in a study that has been published for the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; if there is a lack of privacy or for men and women , men and women can come together , it can be - constant violence against women . &quot;
&quot; mainly the wash@@ rooms should be separated and readily available for women , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women of this protection can be felt , it is possible to read through the An@@ d@@ ote , which there is in the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since she has been around for us that there is us , we have a long queue , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily make a second house .
general practitioner : demands for new work conditions
&quot; representatives of the assistance personnel have called on their union , to create new working conditions in their dispute regarding a new contract . &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tor Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded his entire Council from beginning September more work measures .
the J@@ DC said that there was Minister of Ministers to respond to the concerns relating to the contract .
assistance and medical students have voted on the rejection of a contract in July with the BM@@ A contract .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to members , who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , that the government would have remained &quot; pers@@ ist@@ ently &quot; to problems , which was rejected that the treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board adapted to reject the proposed new contract , and requested official re@@ negotiations for all of those who are concerned . &quot;
&quot; the response to the silence of the government has provided a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council , in order to escal@@ ate a current programme of escal@@ ating work measures , beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to that assistance in this year was sixteen , the first total failures in the history of N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the director of the BM@@ A Ass@@ istance in Dr. Johann Mal@@ a@@ ana came after the choice for rej@@ ecting the agreed agreement conditions , which had been recommended by BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which were still known prior to the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistants and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; following the vote , the Minister of Health Minister Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t said that the contract for physicians in England would be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of exterior &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and pro@@ claim an official end of the eight month long lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart at the St. Petersburg &apos;s palace in reception , I cannot defend oneself of the expression that Ankara wants to end this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles had a little bit of heat , even for its revers@@ ed circumstances . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke about his &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report all the five times . &quot;
I could no longer count .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis , but will even be improved . &quot;
&quot; the next day a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have heard that , than would never make something worse . &quot;
to me his enthusiasm seemed to indicate rather the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cooling showed that the President of Russia had not forgotten anything . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his quotes : the de@@ preci@@ ation of a Russian struggle aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the period was w@@ ut@@ ated .
&quot; Putin shared and accused Ankara , Russia in the back . &quot;
passing was even bigger since it was committed by a alleged friend .
freezing rebuild becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at one time it seemed like the Turks , for all the guilt . &quot;
&quot; most serious , the accus@@ ations of leading officials killed that Erdo@@ gan would have benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , which are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message that it was time to look ahead . &quot;
&quot; after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology of President Erdo@@ gan , who he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the benefits of a cease @-@ fire clearly lie on the hand .
Erdo@@ gan needs first and foremost all the friends who he can get after the last month with a failed coup d &apos;@@ et@@ ched almost his wheel .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban of charter flights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
the number is decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel insurance and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
you count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week projected the state television , cheaper with fruit and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti imagined it : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West as it was the response to the tried to take power of power as a weak response .
&quot; to do so , the continued Gro@@ ll over the snow@@ fall of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke is to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , Russian leader won a bonus in Ankara that he called for the tried coup d support for the elected government organs . &quot;
&quot; this is well @-@ evident for Moscow , a matter of course , which itself has a deeper fear of reg@@ im@@ e@@ changes . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this glorious palace at the sea made possible Russia and Turkey , one , as it was once an analy@@ st , described , &quot; alliance of external side &quot; : two countries who are rejected and poorly treated by the West and now . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in spite of public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently got the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sites . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both Presidents were told at the press conference , that they could not even grasp the subject . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey dis@@ mis@@ ed it on a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open en@@ m@@ ity , and in view of the potential for a complete dis@@ aster , as NATO member Turkey abol@@ ished the Russian martial arts - it is certainly better that the two heads of state will at least talk to one another . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for Scotland outside Scotland is no longer available
&quot; according to the Board of Directors , the R@@ BS brand should be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the Board of Directors . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan divided the BBC Scotland with that the R@@ BS brand associated with the global ambitions of the Bank .
the Bank has since dist@@ ancing itself when she had almost collap@@ sed and saved for eight years ago .
&quot; at this time brand &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer financial brands . &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds for Sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now it has decided to put more national brands into focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and the stock exchange at Nat@@ West will change . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are others , smaller brands for the private customer business which will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; he divided the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will become our Invest@@ ors &quot; brand , as well as the brand , which will be employed by our employees , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now I say that we do not pursue global goals , but local objectives . &quot;
each of these brands will be totally different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
&quot; R@@ BS has already told that its Six Nations sponsor@@ ing will no longer be continued , and that it will increase the perceptions of different brands in his sports sponsorship . &quot;
&quot; it is time for us to develop the brands of brands , because how do we focus inside ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the Board of Directors . &quot;
three years ago it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these marks .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can recover these brands again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3.@@ 000@@ ten prize at New@@ market
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori Br@@ üh@@ t champagne after a double in New@@ market , who brings him 3,@@ 000@@ ,000 gain &quot;
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3.@@ 000@@ ten British profits at New@@ market .
&quot; he sat on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey , who reached the milestone in the low@@ race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , Pat Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ ali@@ ge winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won at G@@ hay@@ yar , said : &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here
&quot; I am very happy that it is with New@@ market , because I am landed here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ aler Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the j@@ ubil@@ ation when he wins the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
&quot; two yo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacles race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4.@@ 4@@ 93 careers . &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey of the modern age and it is not a surprise that he has achieved this milestone in a few before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that differs from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma fans have been excited for this sport for years . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie some weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already scored 6,000 profits when he was not just a weekend and big tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already got a winner in the UK almost 30 years ago .
&quot; he has a living personality , what is good for a bri@@ tish race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Fl@@ ying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from flying finishes to Fl@@ ying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of British low@@ lands for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; glorious Seven &apos; in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban . &quot;
&quot; three years ago he had returned difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month Sper@@ re , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to de@@ fy its branches and to return to its shape . &quot;
and he is still not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said earlier he wants to continue at competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russia Putin fired rod in Serge@@ y Sergei Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has released un@@ expect@@ ant his staff leader Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a lot of years of the closest conspir@@ ators of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed special representative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is that Putin asked without giving reasons &quot; the dis@@ mis@@ sal of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidency . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was dep@@ u@@ ties since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he made his degree at the prestigious international Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Krem@@ lin , it is said ( in Russian ) , that he later was the chief manager and Chief of Govern@@ ors of the Govern@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; about his appointment he said to Putin , &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as President Prime Minister for the law , and checks for the implementation of your instructions . &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov has asked that Ivan@@ ov has asked to leave his post and called V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has turned Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest conspir@@ ators Vladimir Putin &apos;s and works like he for the Soviet secret service to the K@@ GB .
he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the leader of his own request came back . &quot;
&quot; but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , here are few of them - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
this is what nobody knows at present .
&quot; but the official claim - that a man , who was once appointed as a potentially president , would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - thrust into great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks on Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said &quot; It is true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation , to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - compl@@ ained posts four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
&quot; before , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of Defense . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin &apos;s former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , the K@@ GB was established , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted . &quot;
&quot; it was once believed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , as a third presidential term coup against the Constitution would have been violated . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , close ally Putin Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became prime minister before he became the President three and a half years later .
Serbian Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he was producing producers
Gib@@ son participated last month in a physical confrontation on the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that manufacture the series reported in a joint statement on his cancellation .
&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , was publicly announced on Thursday before the announcement of his cancellation . &quot;

Queens@@ Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
£ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project must be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the Nord@@ deck of the Queens@@ Cros@@ sings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four narro@@ wn@@ ings of the &quot; &quot; cover blo@@ wer &quot; , &quot; which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the bridge @-@ section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 ton .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , and 46 s@@ lash @-@ sei@@ ling . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; the Minister of Economic Minister Keit@@ h Brown stat@@ ute today took a visit today , and was one of the first to go out from the country to the bridge . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queens@@ Cros@@ sings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering team of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30.000 tonnes of concrete and steel , which alone were used for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge is a delicate activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , nearly 79 % of the total flo@@ cks in their place and last section of Dec@@ ks gets a Bet@@ ong@@ g for the Deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
in this fantastic project the clas@@ p is setting forward @-@ looking high@@ - and deep @-@ construction .
&quot; after installing the last stre@@ ch section , and the connection with which in the expansion of the North Gate , we had to close the existing gap on the north or country side . &quot;
this was achieved by dra@@ gging the northern Zu@@ er@@ bridge 700 millimeters in the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , because the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct 2@@ 22 meters long , about 6,000 tonnes weighs and with a slope of about 3 % had to be pulled up . &quot;
&quot; pag@@ an , as the toler@@ ances that work on the team are tiny - on each side they bore only a few millimeters . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
&quot; rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three males have &quot; &quot; happiness still to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; happiness still to be alive &quot; &quot; after being thrown by her fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim in security , while their boat moved on their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and placed us the worst before , &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds used the boat apart from their reach until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found at a bo@@ oths without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all arrived on board of the coastal road boots and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr. Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men who were cast into the water have fortunately un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boot @-@ engine had a not@@ ori@@ ce , but this del@@ etes the boat off the person from the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has awakened over these men today .
heavy hurt - man sti@@ cht on his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
&quot; as the police yesterday afternoon , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had got the keys to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcoholic perpetr@@ ator cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when this came into the apartment , he saw twice on her . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and by the body .
the police could take the perpetrators .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot;
this aler@@ ted then his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother . &quot;
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the road they met the ex @-@ partner of the man .
&quot; when the two women played the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old took his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ friend . &quot;
who builds comfortable apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Greens mean : investors should be much stronger in the future . &quot;
how to react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 @-@ cheap apartments in the next few years ?
&quot; the SPD suggests a &quot; &quot; scope of life &quot; &quot; to the next meeting . &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
&quot; first and foremost , it is about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ? &quot;
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; SPD spokes@@ person Christoph Brat@@ mann believes : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Greens : those who want to build on urban areas must continue to show 20 percent of all the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be found in the stock . &quot;
&quot; but the great defense point in the Town Hall is , however , such as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you talk to investors , who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build such a minimum of 10 percent , but as possible 20 percent of the apartments are building as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing program , which will cost millions of cost and is still financed , should provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , such as Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the left wants to be more rig@@ ged for investors .
&quot; regardless of what Brat@@ mann , as Brat@@ mann , a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; the scope of action is implemented , which will provide additional tasks in the administration administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the specialists .
&quot; yet the program is not entirely different : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
how do you compare the loss of further approximately 1300 @-@ priced apartments which will run for the next few years ?
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , the plan@@ ing policies of Nicole Palm , should now be bought from the city . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it would have to be thought about it , apartments again and return to prices . &quot;
this is possible in the West@@ stadt .
one fell on one stroke to solve the problem .
&quot; for in the west city , the end of the year will run . &quot;
&quot; approximately 1800 apartments , one could get back to the price delivery for cheap apartments . &quot;
&quot; only : this does not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the Western city is dramatically increasing , it is removed from the objective of the so @-@ called Com@@ bin@@ aries . &quot;
there should no longer be a concentration of social weak in just a few neighbour@@ hoods .
the Greens expect that there is still movement in discussion .
&quot; leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a wide majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot;
I have concentrated on more buildings for single @-@ family dwell@@ ings .
but what does not mean that cannot be found yet a compromise .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon go , a hunt for health and happiness that is profitable &quot;
it &apos;s fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; that teenagers and child are no longer going outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time enjoying on screens , was in the last decade of many laments . &quot;
&quot; with Pok@@ emon Go , it is about getting people from the sofa and get active . &quot;
&quot; the time on screen was initially limited to TV , then on video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters , which were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later this creates a animated series , game cards and other spin @-@ off ) . &quot;
&quot; like many phenomena of the population , the interest in the US , Australia and New Zealand began in early July . &quot;
the launch of the market in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the server over@@ head .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players with their smartphones go outside and looking for Pok@@ é@@ mons to be followed by a GPS and once they were found once , &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; ( over a scre@@ enshot on the mobile ) or &quot; &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation who played the game as she was still younger , joined the whale and sprang out for the sofa . &quot;
in the US the game has led to a considerable increase in steps that puts the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
&quot; car@@ o@@ gram , one app for Apple Watch , followed by the 3@@ 5.000 users , divided the Washington Post recently concluded that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays from which Pok@@ é@@ mon go - it only sees the raw data to enhance performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health people want to take &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; to get involved &quot; &quot; from the sofa and &quot; &quot; get active &quot; &quot; every day , because many public messages for health are boring and coming from people who look miserable . &quot;
&quot; however , the importance of sport can not be over@@ valued . &quot;
&quot; who drives regular exercise regularly , reduces his chances to be suffering from cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonder@@ full of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is , that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine and fun . &quot;
some people join the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as always , there is also mur@@ ky game spo@@ on , who always have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could go against a door . &quot;
what should it be ?
it has made a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ Bit could already follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its charm and will leave the use with time .
&quot; due to their poker success , however , there will be more games , giving apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and help many people to hunt for active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ a

Simone Bil@@ es is on all the im@@ mu@@ n .
dynam@@ ically on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breath@@ tak@@ ingly on the floor .
on the whole line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympics .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast cl@@ auses on Thursday to the surplus @-@ title and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
&quot; the total output of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the Silver medal and &quot; &quot; Final Five &quot; &quot; team @-@ sk@@ amer@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ a@@ ill@@ en@@ um@@ er Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the American Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ ers on the pig @-@ beam during the individual multi @-@ struggle between women in the Olympic Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; it is the fourth hetero@@ sexual American , which wins a surplus @-@ venture and altogether the fifth , while she solidi@@ fies its reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
she broke tears in tears as their final result was shown and her long journey at this moment found an end .
this success puts it in the same league such as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
&quot; it has been the last three years its sport species dominates , 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises , which include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u re@@ ton of her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I have ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it expected them last test in Brazil , a competition which was not so much between it and the rest of the athletes , but rather between it and a burden @-@ dimension@@ ed expectations . &quot;
&quot; do not return with a handful of gold back to family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American ow@@ es Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ acing , after they have won gold and silver in the individual multi @-@ struggle division of women in the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , &quot;
&quot; it fet@@ ched the first medal on Tuesday , while she served on the farewell party of the team of retired cre@@ at@@ ters Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi used as a fe@@ der sign . &quot;
&quot; although it was ins@@ isted during their long way@@ &apos;s to the top , never the future planned , this is not really true . &quot;
part of its soil exercises - which contain its typical Tum@@ bling passport - is matched to Latin American music that would fit home on the road outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was adopted by trainers A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a shoulder @-@ flu@@ ent in the g@@ ymnasium , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has lost no multi @-@ struggle competition , a triumph@@ al series , which will stop as long as it desires . &quot;
&quot; even when Must@@ af@@ ina led easily through two screen@@ ings , dec@@ eived the picture . &quot;
pig and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es the World title holds - lau@@ ghed .
she fet@@ ched again with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig and sat on the ground with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ aced them gently when she anticipated her duck @-@ age - a mere form@@ ality - and tears flow into Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision that they once described in their collective book , in reality . &quot;
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke at Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team @-@ capitalism had called &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; , &quot; which is called a lead . &quot;
&quot; after their soil exercise , they cast to the audience of Kus@@ sh@@ es , blown away by a com@@ eback , which sometimes was du@@ bi@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; in terms of it , that rapidly spread T@@ we@@ et of 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week , a whole new meaning : &quot;
police : 3 victims in mass attack in music hear in the car
&quot; according to police reports that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot in one of the most mortal attacks since a decade in the first series of mass attack , while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot at the 12th of June while the car was parked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , said the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire weapon , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and fled afterwards with another vehicle , is in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police shared that the thre@@ e@@ fold murder does not have been the result of a rob@@ bery , as the att@@ acker doesn &apos;t have the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of the investig@@ ators opened , a closer look at it , if it is connected with four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , predominantly in h@@ isp@@ anic neighbour@@ hoods were killed in nine months in nine candidates seven people and two others wounded . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , divided Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that they led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized due to their wounds and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness of the police with that it was not uncommon for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which desc@@ ended on an empty Pick@@ up Truck for half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial mur@@ ders . &quot;
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ auer and secured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as ball frag@@ mente from the motor space .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old loves Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to the singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the least of his aging , Ed@@ mund micro cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy did not know . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time it was my first thought , I won &apos;t . &quot;
I am not creating this .
I did not let myself down .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course one has left it on it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
your husband Vincent and her was told that Ed@@ mund she can never see her under certain circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far they sought to institu@@ tion@@ alize it .
&quot; my first answer to it was &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do it , &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor sit down to his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but it slowly makes progress .
he can run with support and ride bike .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; Elizabeth shows the drawing language , which Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please do something ahead &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him a language , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical character -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as at Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or ci@@ ca@@ vi@@ rus during pregnancy .
symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to tell how to influence life with the ci@@ ca@@ vi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to remembers the emotional price of a certain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
I have wondered for a prognosis for a long time because I didn &apos;t expect to really tell me someone really .

&quot; fierce rainf@@ all and large @-@ scale floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana were forced to the governor , on Friday the emergency . it will be calculated all over the Saturday with more rainf@@ all . &quot;
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast Lou@@ isi@@ anas and the south of the to@@ pp@@ is flooded their banks and dro@@ wn with large @-@ scale floods in extreme rainf@@ all , reported the National weather service . &quot;
&quot; the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John Bel Edwards shared that government officials are standing in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the way to the communities affected . &quot;
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ se of the Govern@@ ors , shared with that the requests for high water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that alone the church has requested Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a floo@@ d@@ war@@ med system is used over large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ anas to Saturday .
the weather service allowed in this area to drop additional 3 to 5 inches in rain .
&quot; on Friday in the south of Alab@@ ama , an early spring @-@ free system was used , while in the area of Mobile continued to rain . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are all likely to reach record over the weekend . &quot;
the Me@@ ter@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flooded many houses in the subur@@ b near Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that a down@@ stream @-@ oriented floods into Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , since the rivers flow slowly into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 . &quot;
rescue teams still cover people from the floo@@ d@@ water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kinson &apos;s southwest of Mississippi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , over night . &quot;
he said to him another step@@ son who lives nearby .
&quot; we are awakened and the water flowing and flooded in , &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it finished my wa@@ ist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford that she lived there during the 48 years , where she had never seen such a high stand of the river . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members could have all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that Not@@ hel@@ fer had saved all three in a great military truck , and brought them to the next fire guard in Glo@@ be , where they were accommodated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floods began to spread quickly , since it continued heavy rainf@@ alls and , that the authorities ev@@ acu@@ ated Ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot;

in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond have been set up shel@@ ters to host ev@@ acu@@ ated .
&quot; once the water begins to go back , they will go back into their homes &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a , almost two middle streets were closed due to the flood of water and sand@@ bags for the residents who are hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last great floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to become a similar incident .
&quot; in the pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Coun@@ t@@ ys , that it is still ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his information a handful of houses on Thursday have been in@@ und@@ ated , but on Friday they have not been reported until now . &quot;

&quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen before , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; von sco@@ ops &quot; &quot; survi@@ ves &quot; &quot; - survi@@ vor in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police dealt with that the 6 year old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time being shot a 6 @-@ year child . &quot;
the grandparents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grandparents gave that Brown suffered several che@@ ers , including in the end , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was with his transport to the hospital in consciousness . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his little body was gra@@ ded by bul@@ lets , divided its grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transm@@ itter . &quot;
I simply cannot believe it .
the state of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy divided the transm@@ itter with that he is expected to be approached .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
also shot three men : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year men is in critical state ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in stable state .
&quot; the boy was shot up on the front of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is located in a critical state , was shot , reports the transm@@ itter . &quot;
&quot; the other two victims were not in the car , and the police have just begun to find out if one of the injured men of the do@@ ers could be . &quot;
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to have come to a crus@@ fire between several sho@@ oters .
&quot; pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ auer for stub@@ born tube , which were traced to different storm @-@ fighters , were driven by the scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly an ongoing battle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk , they were sle@@ eves . &quot;
&quot; so it seems to have been here several armed fighters who were very actively involved , &quot; divided police force at Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles made in the area .
&quot; there came to no feast , and the police are currently checking in reviews , according to the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a stop@@ pers on the arm when she played in front of her house in the neighborhood of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a susp@@ ects .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
this is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympic Winter Olympics and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I have been around since 1984 at any summer Olympics and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; secondly , this team has three Tur@@ ner@@ inside , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspir@@ es for many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , which is Catho@@ lics , makes every pride . &quot;
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has solidi@@ fied the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one of the female Tur@@ ner@@ inside an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were both Simone and # 2 .
this shows strength .
in the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympics and the US che@@ ered .
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as it has been unexpected , yet master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics routine . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , hetero@@ sexual American , who won gold at an individual multi @-@ struggle event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are witn@@ essing the top of this sport type , but so do not see turn@@ around in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie hit all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison , to create it into the Olympic Team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Most Five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympics are only four turmoil in the team . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as trainers . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks so that Tur@@ nen is a expensive sport and tur@@ ner primarily in private gym , which are maintained by parents who pay for training , furnishing , travel and hotel costs ( for the coach and their tur@@ ner and families ) . the list can be continued . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ around are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these verses , the Tur@@ ner received a total training and that is for families an expensive and long @-@ term commitment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Train@@ ers of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ ers by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained their athletes since they started with the Tur@@ nen . &quot;
&quot; we need to be inspired by the con@@ gregations of numerous , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , to make a powerful and easily accessible trainers . &quot;
I have founded my gym of 20 years .
&quot; for my events , we have provided free and affordable turtle in Harlem for more than 15,000 inhabitants ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hometown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality Tur@@ nen that earn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
&quot; turtles develop strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for training and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this crew , which bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the tower and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to take part in the sport , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the hol@@ s of the olymp@@ ic team and thanks , F@@ ass her so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance practitioners would like to organise further strikes after they rejected Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over changes through the adoption of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.000 Assist@@ enz@@ ologists who voted in a choice , refused . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t plans un@@ veiled to introduce the contract , and said that N@@ HS was in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ land &quot; &quot; and that the N@@ HS would be harmful to employees and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first assistant should receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekly contribut@@ ors to improve the care . &quot;
&quot; DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , the Chairman of the BM@@ A Com@@ pati@@ ble for Assist@@ enz@@ ologists did last night in a communication with &quot; &quot; Assist@@ ants &quot; &quot; have had serious concerns , in particular that the current availability crisis will be tac@@ kled and it is given to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; in just eight weeks , which remain even remaining until the first group of doctors are under the new treaty , progress must be made and the time is running out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve any dispute with talks during the government on the sake of reluc@@ tance to participate and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; it happened to say that Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t had made it last month , that his door was always open . &quot;
Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t must act now to raise the penetration and address the worries of the assistance .
&quot; if he was not doing this , it did not have the assistance that they are willing to carry out further work conditions . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a re@@ bu@@ b of almost 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates , since nur@@ ses and specialists were included to grant doctors on the post@@ p@@ endant coverage . &quot;
the Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over changes through an acceptance of the reform of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants a better vo@@ icing payment for the 5@@ 4,000 employees who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of N@@ HS staff , called for the assistance to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; working conditions achieve nothing of the only little , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nursing homes and their families only worries , hard@@ ship and break . &quot;
&quot; over the past two months , we have spoken to the Com@@ mentary School of Assistant and with the Ministry of Health and other ministries positively to concerns about the tut@@ el@@ age and wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wings . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who have been returning from a professional career , training holiday and gender @-@ specific wage gap in medicine - a sign of how serious it were employers , health education England and the Ministry of Health in terms of compliance with BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per Tag@@ - drug that can reduce heart attack
&quot; thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , after the authorities have been advised to ad@@ minister this more people for a longer time period . &quot;
the ger@@ ent drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart disease for people with a reduction disease .
&quot; the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack . &quot;
the regul@@ ators N@@ ICE of N@@ HS has recommended a four year long intake to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regul@@ ators N@@ ICE of N@@ HS has recommended a four year long intake to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 14@@ 0.000 people suffer from a heart attack , and a quarter of it suffer from another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attack and stroke will be caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the arteries that make Bel@@ ä@@ ge .
&quot; when the day breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ine caused the blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; if the blood c@@ ots sol@@ ves , it can flow through the flow of blood and conce@@ aled blood flow to the brain , which causes a stroke . &quot;
persons who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ eca and under the name of Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health @-@ evaluation centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons suffered a heart attack , another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack may have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing further heart attack and stroke cases in people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; due to the preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are happy that we are able to expand the treatment options of thousands of people who benefit from it . &quot;
&quot; the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the blood @-@ risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the management board recommends no treatment , which goes beyond that time period . &quot;
culture of the Political Cor@@ rec@@ tor lets elections in Muslim regions
&quot; the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ unto Rah@@ man was lod@@ ged last year on dis@@ mis@@ sal of a government report , because of corruption from the office . &quot;
a culture of the Political Cor@@ rec@@ tor has led to that far @-@ wi@@ dened constitu@@ ents in Muslim communities are ignor@@ ing like a crus@@ hing government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet of Sir Eric Pick@@ les travels to the police , voting and Rath@@ dwell@@ ers to have evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; over@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ nie and religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and local government , who is now a face @-@ corrupt , said that the intimi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so badly that the police should be allowed to set up shel@@ ters outside of electoral cabins to set out voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should lead a withdrawal with him in order to prove their identity in the elections .
currently a vot@@ er must just call his name and address .
&quot; the report proposes to wear not even remot@@ able ink on the fingers of a person , when they give up their vote to prevent that someone chooses twice . &quot;
wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers should maintain more protection says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have more access to community conditions and decisions by non @-@ official commis@@ sions or working groups .
&quot; this not only serves against the election , but should also protect the municipal government in front of the broader corruption and financial culture , which is associated with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Elec@@ sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
&quot; last year decided by a special course , that the acting mayor of Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be enth@@ used after a L@@ itan@@ ei to corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community , &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with se@@ is@@ ations and Islam@@ ophobia . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ man is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the relative obligation of Muslims , to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of a im@@ itation , in which a person chooses to choose another . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there were evidence in the whole country evidence of fraud .
he was especially alar@@ ming on frau@@ dul@@ ent let@@ tering - for older members of the Muslim community have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
&quot; Sir Eric , illustrated , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the filling of out to show the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; as proof was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , particularly women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ tica or bank@@ rupt background . &quot;
&quot; there was concerns that ... state institutions had such a behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; over@@ sensitivity regarding the eth@@ nie and religion . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric spoke about 50 recommendations in order to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activ@@ ist let@@ tering orders to stop &quot; &quot; re@@ ap &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , being considered by Ther@@ esa May , requires also tougher registration tests to prevent that the electoral directory is used for im@@ migrant and social security purposes . &quot;
consider options considering voters before choosing to ask for your message .
&quot; not removing ink on the finger of a person , as soon as she has given her voice to prevent that someone chooses twice . &quot;
systematic review of the nationality of a person to carry out to ensure they are optional .
a three @-@ year limit on applications for an automatic re@@ election .
prohibition that political activ@@ ist will deal with full @-@ elections and envel@@ opes of stamp selections .
the police give the authority to set up b@@ ings for electoral gy@@ ms .
&quot; a legislative change , which made an indictment to be facilitated by intimi@@ dation according to the representation of the People Act 1983 ( Re@@ representation of the People Act 1983 ) . &quot;
photography offered in electoral stations .
requirements that only English can be used in the electoral stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the staff will rule prevail that voters alone go into the cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets no street was shown .
&quot; the electoral court has said Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for because of a L@@ itan@@ ei to corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; he said . &quot;
it was ple@@ aded due to a number of reasons for sufficiently - according to high requirements in criminal proceedings - guilty .
he also critici@@ zed the in@@ effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ checks &quot; of the electoral divisions of the Town Hall .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the judgment part in Tower Ham@@ lets from the last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country bears as the mother of the parliaments a proud heritage , but the worrying and covered spread of constitu@@ ents and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Double Challenge and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ ers in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad in Rio in Rio are out this week on the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot out of the edge and band that has proven themselves as impressive col@@ li@@ ces in the Du@@ chy of Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by no means the only one in order for gold batt@@ ling athle@@ te that displays its own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not , if you can give faith to social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are fli@@ pping at our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a list of Olympi@@ ans that have more than just a certain similarity with hol@@ ly@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o &quot;
&quot; besides K@@ ates doubles on the radar track , there are many people on the internet how a certain ar@@ cher can be the twin @-@ type of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a storm on Twitter after pictures , on which he sees the wolf of Wall Street Star in@@ secretly . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher was given the madness in the social media and gave it to hear that he has already been hearing from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not see any great similarity , except the facial hair , shared Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so do I look at it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; one of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be at the centre point : the rising similarity between the British vast@@ ness Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford , and the popular actor Neil Patrick Har@@ ris . &quot;
&quot; the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expres@@ sive eyes is said to be a col@@ later@@ als for the Cub@@ an American singer of Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with the avenue Star Matthew Mor@@ rison . &quot;
one course higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
&quot; a further prolonged comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ l , which shows similar heavy eyeb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
the Russian Silver medal in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun@@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne McC@@ ord while the Americans Nathan was attacked by fans of an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
&quot; strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , on the right , have a similar facial form and eyes &quot;
not the only ones : a Twitter @-@ user was very happy that other similarities were also noticed
&quot; theory made in the room : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the similarity of the couple perhaps . &quot;
&quot; one Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in explained its satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the US @-@ football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar facial form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular comparisons recorded Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is nearly identical with the act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold medal in Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which has its own gorgeous , wide smile that resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ colored twe@@ ete , &quot; Hat the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ ers died from China &quot; like a pig ? ? ? ? &quot;

&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m Fre@@ isti@@ l@@ sch@@ adren@@ staff@@ el for women , as described : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the bond , baby . &quot;
the criticism against Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard with whom many talked about him
&quot; Twitter users did not think back , when they heard how uns@@ ensi@@ tizing Byron Mac@@ Donald was &quot;
&quot; another Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you re@@ present the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like rac@@ ists . # .
&quot; short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who made the C@@ BC broadcast live , live for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said , &quot; We are sorry that the comment has been broadcast over a swimming pool . &quot;
&quot; it was a unhappy chosen formulation , we are sorry that it is happening . &quot;
C@@ BC apologi@@ zed at the end of more than 90 times in people who have responded to the comments on Twitter
the comment@@ ator @-@ mate Scott Rus@@ sel had to apologi@@ ze for himself in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
&quot; C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology at more than 90 other Twitter users , who compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments . &quot;
the network ap@@ olog@@ ised quickly and gave a message .
&quot; we sincerely regret that these statements were made , and that it was possible that it will be broad@@ cast@@ ed . &quot;
last night we quickly exc@@ used with our spectators on show and our Fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in the social media .
&quot; to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ k &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers in and not on her as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an unhappy chosen formulation . Byron does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald won in the programme and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it is designed as a personal attack .
&quot; I &apos;d like to take a moment to apologi@@ ze for the comment that I did after the wom@@ ens squ@@ ad@@ rons in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ us , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have myself related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers , not based on her as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark outra@@ ged over woman who are in the midst of the shop sham@@ eless under@@ wear
&quot; the buyers did not know where to see , when a woman moved their clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , they numbered how she looked at it , she drew off and put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she continued and tried four pairs of sau@@ cer in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , near . &quot;
&quot; the Pri@@ mark shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place mall in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman sam@@ pled the under@@ pants before they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in the shop , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , she moved again and left the shop , without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the shop standing , she took a pair of pants from the base , drew her own shr@@ ink and pants from and tried them . &quot;
she did not even try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , fre@@ t as O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; each star@@ ing , when they turned back the sau@@ cer , which you obviously have not fallen , since they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three further under@@ pants , before they finally decided that her fell on , went back and went out . &quot;
she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b that she watched someone - or to think about the person who in circumstances would buy the under@@ pants that she had tried .
&quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; as reluc@@ tant to think that someone had sub@@ pants with home which had a different person and which were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Davi@@ dson added : &quot; as I received , the staff tries to pull the garments from the sale after she went - what is just as good . &quot;
&quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of sau@@ cer , and find out that another woman had her and returned , and they were not washed away . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said , &quot; Pri@@ mark is in the incident that occurred on Tuesday , 9 of August in our branch in folk stone , consciously . &quot;
all products in question have been drawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from ceas@@ e@@ fire
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we spoke with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to circum@@ navigate with armed predat@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether one approaches you from the front or behind the rear , this video will show you how to turn around for your predat@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; if one gets se@@ wn from behind , you should turn out to be the first , so that you can see your att@@ acker and go out of the line , &quot; &quot; said Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
grab the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then hit him with his knees in the Le@@ iste , and turn , while the aggres@@ sors were stir@@ red against pain , the weapon from his hands . suggest to him with the run and move back , while they move the weapon on it . &quot;
&quot; approach att@@ ackers , which approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the head@@ line , grab the gun and rot@@ ate them , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight to the gun and strike the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon from its handle before they move back@@ wards and establish the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it is Miz@@ ra@@ chi Pre@@ man@@ power .
&quot; but remember that there is a case with a smoking at the safest , your money should be over@@ enough - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master . &quot;
travel@@ er Ian Wright ple@@ t for a guide to his tongue in the dirty places of Europe
a bri@@ tish travel under@@ went his immune system and wor@@ ship@@ ef@@ le@@ x of a serious test - by doing some of the dirty and ek@@ ho@@ ur@@ est places in Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel gate Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k hat@@ ched his course on a Euro shr@@ ine , a rail@@ ing on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a washing button of a train toi@@ lette as well as a public phone in Russia to prove the immune system of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before the le@@ ak of every object , he used a li@@ umin@@ ometer to show itself and to show us what he will get involved . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was under the title &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; , &quot; brought some surprising results . &quot;
&quot; the thought to throw the dish@@ kno@@ b of a train toi@@ lette , which has already been used by thousands of others , may seem entirely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact they are in a kitchen rin@@ se more bad bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he spec@@ kled , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright has been known to test the resili@@ ence of its Dar@@ ms by travelling through the world and ate peculiar , as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to train stations up to dish@@ wash@@ ers of toilets , the task set his immune system definitely under a sample &quot;
&quot; he told him : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;
in the film he was sure to do justice to his reputation .
&quot; the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot;
his trial line showed a L@@ umin@@ om@@ eters of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ om@@ eters are fresh and less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to deny , after their L@@ umin@@ ometer over 4000 units was , while freshly washed hands one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel agent &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial levels in different places such as the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; This is the worst thing I have packed in a toilet , near . &quot;
there is nothing beats than that !
I &apos;m going to so@@ cks here nothing because it is here in@@ doors .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company flo@@ cked Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ hafts and New categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer really something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiot@@ ics .
&quot; we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings by doing so that we said , &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about products , we wanted to put it into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direction of the film , added : &quot; let me say it : &quot; &quot; let me have lost my respect for Ian , if he would like to see some of the things I have reli@@ ed on it , as the ek@@ el@@ ous Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to empty them and others where this was quite difficult . &quot;
&quot; I am glad , that we recorded some of these dirty goodies to film . &quot;
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o @-@ conducted survey conducted in 2015 , 84 per cent of all respon@@ dents received military @-@ bacterial bacteria in particular with the wellbeing of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products that include both mil@@ le @-@ bacterial bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social family destroyed in front of Del@@ o@@ gi@@ te Social Apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left their social home after del@@ o@@ gi@@ ment with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 because it had terror@@ ising their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were removed from their property , the con@@ federation of the con@@ co@@ oper@@ atives found the property in an irre@@ par@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls of cl@@ aff@@ ised holes on , wooden di@@ mp@@ s were turned down , rub@@ b@@ ish was disper@@ sed on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls . &quot;
the family were surrounded and it is thought that she is now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the household management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said they feared that the apartment is no longer to fix . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
&quot; there are many things to consider , since this property is probably considered not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is it too .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had added , street fights with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ors , intimi@@ dated by residents , drug abuse , drug stores and over@@ ly scre@@ ams , spre@@ es and floods . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an order for anti @-@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which under circumstances will be demol@@ ished , old trash was found &quot;
&quot; there were been in the property , in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden houses . &quot;
neighbours said that they had to fight them on the streets and periodic@@ ally had to be called the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ cked her and her partner this week for@@ ci@@ bly by the property after giving them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to voluntarily draw .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ment were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their life was made to hell .
&quot; one said : &quot; &quot; she moved to nobody . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
&quot; the countless times , which we say the police here are incredible . &quot;
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - that we are not accustomed !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it had administered the family to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
the family lived in the house where the police was sum@@ mon@@ ed at regular intervals 20 years
on the over@@ laid side of the community @-@ house were dis@@ missed rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys .
&quot; he added : &quot; it is a shame that it dre@@ aming the ten@@ ant , taking any responsibility for their behavior and the family as del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
&quot; it was a very difficult case , as the behaviour was extremely difficult and had to be part of their deeds for their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have gr@@ ace@@ fully pushed us and have made us the information we have done . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this development will give con@@ sol@@ ation to some neighbours and im@@ par@@ ted the message that anti @-@ social behaviour is not toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons were to live at different times in the house , but that they all be over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress inside one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ gi@@ ment on the ground
&quot; workers of the household management will now have to leave garbage neighborhoods , which surround the house &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , the police led a raid on the house and found hundreds of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ b@@ als , and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don received a fine , after she had found himself guilty of the possession of a drug of a class B in merchant &apos;s view . &quot;
she asser@@ ted that money for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don was born in 2013 at an automobile accident .
&quot; after having been without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many rooms of the house were awarded with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
&quot; the police tells that they are char@@ med tenants , which are not kept to the house@@ order &quot;
&quot; Angela C@@ row , by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall shared that del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication is a clear warning to the other tenants that don &apos;t stop at the house@@ order . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who are thinking that they can behave without self @-@ accus@@ ations , as well as those who have been s@@ worn by such a behaviour , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that continue to work with partners to protect our communities . &quot;

&quot; this was the moment , in which frightened tourists begin to panic after a ti@@ ghtly jet down over a full beach . &quot;
dramatic video recordings showed how the military plane flew almost in reaching proximity to the sun be@@ ards on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers pointed , as they were understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the bowls , without having to see what was coming through the clouds . &quot;
&quot; the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers , told the videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; it flew twice really very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would rush . &quot;
&quot; N@@ uno arrogan@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt so , as if the airplane falls down to me . &quot;
&quot; tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic , when the plane came out of darkness and flew incredibly deep . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese air forces gave today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Orion aircraft was placed on a training trip to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and so deep fly , that this was the only way to recognize them . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man said that the Jet due to the poor visibility of view was somewhat deeper than usual , however , the air forces ins@@ isted that safety at no time was endangered . &quot;
&quot; Fle@@ mish fires have destroyed this summer parts of the Portuguese celebration , where four people came to death on the island Madeira . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese air forces gave today that the pilot had to fly because of the conditions - heavy fog and br@@ anding - so deep , what he restric@@ ts his point of view . &quot;
the plane was on a training trip where the pilot fishing boats had to identify as part of the exercise .

&quot; in addition , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andre ter Ste@@ gen is missing . &quot;
&quot; the German suffered a change in training in training , with which the request for Bar@@ ca is at least being clarified in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
the Chi@@ lean International and T@@ er Ste@@ gen weather in Barcelona has been a number one for two years now .
&quot; so far , Coach Luis Enri@@ que did not put it up until now on a clear decision and made Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er Ste@@ gen in most of the other applicants . &quot;
&quot; before the first obligatory game of the new game time there is doubt about the fitness state of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;

Ma Long in a separate League for ping @-@ p@@ ong gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympics .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old took place on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one @-@ sided finale to his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; title defence &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4.2 ) .

bronze went to the Japanese Jun@@ Mi@@ ros@@ ani .
the two Chinese have made it as expected to play in the final game and made the title among each other .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympics was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left to the record alone , between the sets and in time @-@ outs they had no co@@ aches . &quot;
they withdrawn into the ble@@ ach@@ ers and left their prot@@ rac@@ ers in a fair competition alone .
&quot; the Mat@@ ches up here , I have played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for me , &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang up . &quot;
after the scores of gold and silver med@@ all@@ ists with the China @-@ Flag .
the match itself was unexpected one @-@ sided .
Ma had to fight with his 28 @-@ year opponent only in the first sentence .
then he set the pace on the plate and left the slope as only a total of 13 points .
the superiority of Ma was not developing the expected match match .
&quot; nevertheless , there were nonetheless enough stunning ball @-@ change to see . &quot;
Mi@@ best@@ ani won the game around bronze against the 40 @-@ year Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; the white rus@@ set had drawn up in his quarter @-@ finals against the German European Championship , Dimit@@ ri@@ j ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , was then in medical treatment , had to settle for &quot; ultimately &quot; with sheet metal . &quot;

Donald Tr@@ ump abo@@ t ″ enormous problems ″ in the electoral campaign
&quot; the leadership of the U.S. Re@@ public@@ ans will be pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditional conservative federal states their majority . &quot;
President Donald Tr@@ ump now gave weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can stronghold Utah .
&quot; a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ lane and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire did something like concerns , such as correspon@@ dents . &quot;
&quot; having thrown 16 Riv@@ als within the own Republi@@ can camp , from the race , the doubts are now growing in the struggle for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump before evangel@@ ical Christians , whom he asked for support in important federal states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; blame was false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he again took his known media bi@@ dding . &quot;
Re@@ public@@ s Hoch@@ bur@@ gen w@@ ack@@ able
Utah is usually a secure bank for re@@ public@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ ve@@ y@@ USA from June onwards , Tr@@ ump and his wife of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , were equal . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance , which for Republi@@ can candidates are common in the federal state . &quot;
&quot; as endangered , Arizona and Georgia are also regarded . &quot;
&quot; in an interview of the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC Tr@@ ump rep@@ lied on the question , as he wanted to stop the march of Clin@@ t : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and h@@ ore : this will be &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
&quot; he does not make anything else , than to tell the truth . &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , be that in order , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to the press report , the party Tr@@ ump will have threatened with funds to support his election campaign , he should present no better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead of considering the candidate of re@@ public@@ ans , the candidates of the Republi@@ can hold more strongly among the arms . &quot;
Olympia : Dre@@ ams scam at D@@ oping test
the IO@@ C wants to set a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ commission to the fall .
Kenya &apos;s athle@@ tics threatens after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after a quick check @-@ off in a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a coach to home . &quot;
&quot; the International Olympic Committee divided with , as soon as a disciplinary Commission to set up the event . &quot;
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary has communicated that the former Spr@@ inter and today Coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , was released in the Olympic Village a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ meter runner . &quot;
this was reported by the team leadership K@@ eni@@ as reported by the dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; the International association IA@@ AF has requested the IO@@ C to get information about the event , to put their own investigations into strict , shared an IA@@ AF speaker . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following actions taken by the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; called it in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the D@@ oping control station and turned out to be &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , &quot; &quot; declared the sample and signed , &quot; &quot; declared K@@ eni@@ as Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I . &quot;
he was owned by the ac@@ creditation of athletes who stood on the list for training procedures in the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was over 800 meters in 2015 in Beijing .
four days before the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics of President Michael Rot@@ i had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio @-@ games .
he should have notified against cash payments of his country over pending dop@@ ing tests .
&quot; according to media reports , he is said to have been arrested in Nairobi at the airport of Nairobi . &quot;
Kenya is at the IO@@ C following numerous dop@@ ing associations for a long time under special observation .
&quot; at the announcement of the IO@@ C laid down by the IO@@ C more than 2000 dop@@ ing targets in front of the Rio @-@ games , it was usually noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are being taken into sight . &quot;
&quot; the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil , to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics .
&quot; in the episode , the W@@ ada Kenya took from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing fight against counter @-@ counter with the rules of W@@ ada . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athle@@ tics of the land won the most medals in Beijing at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports of the ARD , the ARD recorded again and again , that in Kenya D@@ oping resources are easily accessible and there shall be a significant mentality of the sport ab@@ out@@ gs . &quot;
&quot; at least , IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had placed them in Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
thereby it could be proven that in this sport @-@ style and systematically investigated .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics were excluded as a result of the summer .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in Shakespeare @-@ year Salzburg Festival explores the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic love couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a Musical is Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; the artistic director Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classic , and filled themselves with the role of Mary a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; in orchestr@@ al , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ elan Di@@ ri@@ gen@@ dered Gust@@ avo Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms . &quot;
we always say they are very Latin American co@@ ined .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really really have music in our blood !
in this staging Bart@@ oli plays an older Lady .
she remembers with melanchol@@ y to her love with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances . &quot;
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it is exceptionally exceptional ! &quot;
and then Mary would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
&quot; so she is wise , of course also naive , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; it resembles me very , my Italian character , whom I have as a ro@@ ot@@ in , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour to work with her .
it is an enormous man .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compliments back : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and passionate ! &quot;
direct is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in each of its movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it &apos;s such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
for the American film@@ maker Philip Cup . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up to date : &quot; in this piece it is about prejudices and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have walked the refugees , back then to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same issues , and they are as much stronger today as at that time . &quot;
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;
&quot; London school n@@ anny , who joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za S@@ UL@@ TA@@ NA , one of three British girls who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;

&quot; it was thought that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ wark of the group in the country , I@@ TV news reported on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; S@@ UL@@ TA@@ NA was 17 years old and died according to her family shortly after she imagined , to leave the war exploited and return to England . &quot;
&quot; you can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with it , to go into a war area - people will ever meet that decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , S@@ UL@@ TA@@ NA and two other school@@ maid went from east London into an airplane towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tan@@ as Family has been told that she married a ISIS fighter in Syria , and has been a widow in a few months . &quot;

&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the leader of Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Republi@@ can in the Senate have blocked confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ nell is the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor of the late judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a phone conference that he expects from Clinton to choose Gar@@ land , with a certain degree of assurance . &quot;
speaking at Rei@@ d later he said that he was not talking to Clinton if they were to nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulate .
&quot; he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clin@@ t team would not worry about unrest with a new candidate . &quot;
Gar@@ land is the top judge for the U.S. App@@ ell@@ ation Court for the District of Columbia .

the Tre@@ ats magazine works with the photographer David Belle@@ mere in order to extract a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of Top@@ cs for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the chief editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his neck @-@ magazine of classic school @-@ play@@ boys distinguished himself , since &quot; Play@@ boy for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he believes that it is the calendar also .
&quot; we need to return to the representation of timeless and classical s@@ nu@@ dity , in which both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release to publish the Kal@@ en@@ dar@@ s . &quot;
women are going to participate in this project because it is a beautiful artwork .

Turkey : Kurdish Church counts with mass cur@@ sed
&quot; who doesn &apos;t fit and Erdo@@ gan is engaged , sitting on packed bags , &quot; says the Inv@@ isible of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation dialogue and world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un . &quot;
the Kurdish community Germany expects ten thousand seekers who escape from Turkey to Germany at short notice .
&quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; &quot; some hundreds of thousands &quot; , &quot; the exile Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; because of the hard passing of the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan following the coup , the Kurdish Church is expecting a mass cur@@ sed to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with ten thousand seekers from Turkey in Germany when the Erdo@@ gan regime fight against minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; says the association &apos;s leader Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; world &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had moved to Kurdish Hoch@@ bur@@ gen , with imp@@ asse , be 500,000 Kurds within Turkey on the run . &quot;
after the failed put@@ sch were still se@@ cular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks .
many are going to start anew in Europe if they are further sup@@ pressed in Turkey .
&quot; it can not be that a state , who is engaged in refugees , produced in their own country of refugees , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the employer compl@@ ained by the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Algeri@@ an cities . &quot;
thus Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the footh@@ ills to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were ex@@ termin@@ ated or sold over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
&quot; the Prime Minister called for the German government positioned itself as sharp , as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its followers . &quot;
also in Germany there is a &quot; Hex@@ en@@ ch@@ d &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics .
in the last few months I did not feel secure in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks .
&quot; more Tur@@ k are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition . &quot;
the Brand@@ mark@@ ers as freight supporters destroyed teachers and other academics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is engaged , sitting on packed bags , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and se@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ based Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reported on appeal to figures of the Federal Ministry of Department , the Turks reported the largest group of the asylum entitled against political persecution accepted by the coup in Germany . &quot;
&quot; on the third day of June 30 , these are 11.@@ 386 people and therefore nearly 29 percent of all accepted as a treatment ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , there is not the prior to war , poverty or the lack of violence . &quot;
&quot; asylum entitled to the Basic Law shall be exclusively political , so by the state side , individually per@@ secuted . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives receive nothing from the summer @-@ election campaign - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from Nor@@ dr@@ h@@ ein @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
&quot; to 2021 the agricultural choice will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in parliament decided already at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for blin@@ dly , as far as hitherto it does not go : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ care struggle - that is both . &quot;
the natives who are to be convinced by the elections are on vacation .
&quot; most vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are on the way , are not the locals , so do not choose the country day . &quot;
&quot; to this end , practical problems arise : during the holidays are hel@@ per , the posters open , ballo@@ ons bub@@ bles , fl@@ yers distribute and out at the end of the voices , only lab@@ eled lab@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the election and last day &apos;s day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to let Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has gone over again to the people of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; the hot stage , if one can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , is now clearly beyond the CD@@ U . &quot;
exciting is how strong new@@ com@@ er Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of cooking .
&quot; cel@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his grand@@ stand . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , distributed ro@@ ses and ch@@ atting a little with the people , as it did already his legendary wor@@ t@@ kar@@ ger predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , past@@ el @-@ old feet got lost and gives the chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel to blame for the blo@@ om of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; your refugee policy , &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; have accelerated the rise of right @-@ wing popul@@ ists , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry now . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its peak data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you are at the wrong time at the right place election campaign . &quot;
she has invited two chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to Grand Chancellor ; Merkel &apos;s parliament is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not have , it was more Nor@@ dr@@ h@@ ein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but there is a shame to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the nor@@ theastern CD@@ U is largely om@@ itted to the usual choices on market spaces and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; so , Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; minor role &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also noted that in the country you are br@@ ittle the base that it needs to be very strict , again a wire to the people . &quot;
&quot; you are just like the left , the SPD , the Greens , in the expan@@ se of the country there are hardly any problems . &quot;
&quot; the council of the CD@@ U constitu@@ ent Kok@@ ert is also self @-@ yiel@@ ding : &quot; they have to go to where it we@@ ave , namely , where men are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Gol@@ dene Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much on the game stands , Sell@@ ering his SPD now called for an especially committed election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just in front of the Af@@ for@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD was still clear with 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Greens , small party with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , are likely to create the leap into the day of land . &quot;
they make a modern virtue of the holidays @-@ need a modern virtue and place their electoral campaign in the internet .
&quot; online Elec@@ tions &quot; , &quot; calls it the governor of Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green election champi@@ ons embark on the search for local stimul@@ ants among the holidays . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top @-@ did@@ did@@ atin , kur@@ t just with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ cl@@ en@@ bur@@ ial lakes and also finds it beautiful . &quot;
&quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; voting in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ renov@@ ations : host@@ esses suffer from blocking
&quot; on the speed , with which the B 27 is renovated , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work that will start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and will not end up until 8 pm , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; they have done everything fairly jag@@ ged , &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff of the Jet @-@ Gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no de@@ duction .
&quot; the construction site could be moved to the South in the mid @-@ season as scheduled , until the end of October it will be ready . &quot;
&quot; praised is also praised , which is responsible for building works , for example , when it comes to setting up accommodation . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday in the South , the block of asphalt road in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen is lifted , and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is restored , the traffic situation within the resort has relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now travel both from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from B 27 .
the so@@ fter traffic through the place seems to be returned .
&quot; there was partly considerable complaints , &quot; said the management manager Florian King responsible for the wrong management manager Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach@@ el@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , port street and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many ra@@ ils were looking for and more likely to be familiar to their Nav@@ i familiar than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to some truck in living areas is fran@@ ste .
&quot; as also the speed of speed are not respected , the municipality emphasises the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there was considerable crossing , &quot; says King , who made himself an location on site . &quot;
two to three per minute have been blown up .
the fastest was with 77 km kilometres at the speed @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
&quot; since the construction site is continued , but it has become more calm . &quot;
&quot; for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg , the street is now open again . &quot;
business owners do not like to look in the cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment has led to their turnover in sales , everyone lets you ask . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some are less concerned . &quot;
&quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; &quot; so for other companies , for whom the reconstruction hardly has consequences . &quot;
&quot; also with the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; slight decline &quot; , &quot; but also a thing that of course is missing . &quot;
the most exploited are the restaurants along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the owners have made it hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was missing the customers of He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil . &quot;
we have to be glad about every euro turnover .
&quot; the revenue bu@@ sted on &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Stre@@ et@@ an@@ ization has thrown its operation &quot; &quot; two years back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his staff have to release them .
if I had had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dischar@@ ged the policy would have changed differently .
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether it might give a financial compensation , with the critic , otherwise , the location benefited from the advantages of the location at the B 27 . now it is also the disadvantages that arise through the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties , where such a funding has been handled . &quot;
&quot; in all cases , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his host will continue . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been settled since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars are less common now due to complicated traffic management , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you cannot drive away , it is also elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; that his stem cells returns to the end of the refurb@@ ishment , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BS@@ E and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of B 27 construction work on its cli@@ ent@@ ele for the biggest crisis which has experienced its hospitality in its many years of history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction , which is already brutal . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; constantly , in the name of the terrorist fight against laws . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now sending a thick security package . &quot;
but what has a d@@ ul@@ sion status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner mean to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; to the coalition @-@ partner &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new safety package . &quot;
they do not demand anybody .
&quot; other , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also participate in the participation .
&quot; but in the Minister of Interior , he is located on results and at a &quot; &quot; al@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère has made a little time after the recent attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach before he presents his conclusions for the safety of the Republic .
&quot; however , they are all the more extensive , but all the more extensive . &quot;
&quot; some have already announced , announced that a new security authority should take care of the b@@ aking co@@ ded communication , is not new . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany must implement several EU requirements to aviation data and weapons . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security agencies is also not surprising .
&quot; to the part de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , the Mai@@ zi@@ ère does not begin to make a second attempt for proposals which have not been made with the SPD : he wants to be sympath@@ ized for terrorist groups under punishment and p@@ opping jihadists with dou@@ bling citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; the CD@@ U @-@ man will be . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he still consider this to be reasonable and demanding nothing , what does not have any chances when co@@ ali@@ ases . &quot;
some new ideas presents de Mai@@ zi@@ ère as well .
they are partly in itself : he is planning the de@@ port@@ ations for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for the imprisonment of people before deportation .
&quot; refugees who are deliberately fet@@ ched into the country , are to check @-@ in before their smartphones , and disclose social media accounts for a safety inspection examination . &quot;
&quot; at D@@ ul@@ ties for exp@@ ired asylum seekers , he wants to ask some still worse than so far - about such that commit crimes , or have consciously taken away their pe@@ ers to conce@@ de their identity . &quot;
some of them is political and legal .
some also affects un@@ exploited and leaves questions openly .
&quot; and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of thought , for example - is the question : what does this actually have to do with certainty and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it does not allow me to speak that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Wür@@ zburg were refugees .
&quot; moreover , many people were worried about the high refugee pay for security . &quot;
and things that are deeply concerned themselves have not settled in election times even now .
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are election struggles . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly taking place in the subject of internal security . &quot;
in the last days there was high between the two parties .
&quot; only a gar@@ ter dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the resorts were also calling for a Bur@@ ka ban and a deduc@@ ed from the double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also a conc@@ il@@ able tones .
from a return from the double pass he kept nothing .
we have free@@ zed the discussion in Germany .
&quot; to re@@ make you new , be not useful . &quot;
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether his own package is constitu@@ ent on all corners and whether it is &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ er partner , has to show itself only . &quot;
there is quite a few things that could provide for arguments .
&quot; however , the SPD is also trying to pro@@ ach themselves with the issue of internal security . &quot;
&quot; party manager Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes once again careful talk and says , &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the security further . &quot;
still Volkswagen g@@ lim@@ p occurs through .
&quot; despite diesel engines , the pay@@ outs increase worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets it is running around .
in the recall there is a term .
Volkswagen starts with the deliveries in the second half of the year .
&quot; Europe &apos;s largest car@@ makers can continue to expand over the course of the year , despite the diesel of diesel , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ moving markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July the core brand VW is weak@@ ened mainly in Western Europe , and with it again the total sale , as the company stated in D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; the brand sold the VW brand in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1,8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales rose 14 percent below the previous year . &quot;
in the homeland market Germany acc@@ ede the ship@@ ments to almost one six@@ ties .
&quot; Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July , particularly on two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it has been given a sales framework in some core markets by &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup in Turkey , British V@@ ot@@ um had deb@@ ited from the EU , explained a spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the car@@ bure@@ au managed to escal@@ ate first , there is also a minus one . &quot;
great stand for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; altogether , the mainly affected domestic brand of Nieder@@ sachsen continues to be further str@@ lim@@ it@@ ated by the diesel scandal : after the first seven months merely a range of minus from 0.@@ 9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles to be@@ ech . &quot;
consolidated Prime Minister Fred Kap@@ pler was able to continue a sales split from January to July .
&quot; 1,3 percent more vehicles supplied Volkswagen at this time , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software package .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW is calling for 2.5 million cars to upgrade into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of retro@@ fit , VW confirmed that the conversion of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after the re@@ armament of the vehicles , there are no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ makers ask the customer after the retro@@ fit a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; guarantee , &quot; as it was on Friday in business travel . &quot;
&quot; cause , legal defects . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen granted its German customers now a guarantee of self @-@ standing diesel models .
this would have confirmed the last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
out of the Verkehrs@@ Ministry was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has completed the conditions of my research Commission , and the KBA . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of this are not accepted , &quot; stated Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power after the upgrade does not take place and all the type of approved vehicle values have unchanged . &quot;
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; warranty &quot; but not how it was in business travel .
&quot; with the vast term &quot; guarantee , Volkswagen is the possibility that customers are coming to a workshop for example half a year after the retro@@ fit , and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; in customer interest , it is important to avoid that in any other damage , which has nothing to do with the distr@@ action , resulting in uncertainty about possible warran@@ ties , as it was called . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW uses the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see is required by wealthy de@@ posit@@ ors in the future as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; President Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers , who park 40 million euros on gyp@@ sum or daily accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Bundes@@ verband Deutscher banks speaks of an individual case , and does not see it as a signal : normal Spar@@ er would not have to fear to pay for their austerity pen@@ sion@@ er . &quot;
&quot; bearings banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.@@ 4 percent criminal record . &quot;
this charge requires the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund from September by private - and corporate clients for deposits on 100,000 euros on po@@ ro@@ - or daily accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs will be 400 euros per year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
it has been estimated 40 million Euros that could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not fail .
&quot; they lie with me at the central bank account and cause 0.@@ 4 percent costs , &quot; said the banking chief . &quot;
&quot; I can not lay down for each million 4000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs will now give him further to the caus@@ ation principle .
&quot; the cash can be easily found in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; I already experienced four survivors , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; , &quot; said the bank . &quot;
most of the customers would have more understanding and rarely respond to other investment forms .
only a few migr@@ ated to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative association Bayern stated : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is causing significant costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; solely to wear , be &quot; business @-@ economically permanently not possible . &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their fees for transaction , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
&quot; with criminal off@@ ences for deposits of three million euros , the Thur@@ in@@ gia Pop@@ ular and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank Alten@@ burger land had made head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive leader of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect individuals to pay up @-@ to @-@ end relief for deposits , this is the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks too much . &quot;
&quot; a banker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a cliff which is equipped with a bit of exu@@ ber@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , if they are free money . &quot;
&quot; the newly established cooperative bank G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ like , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; in the region you have known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; the cooperative union Bayern &quot; are currently no other banks known , which comp@@ ut@@ ate an ex@@ propri@@ ation for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the German People &apos;s B@@ anks and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ banks ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared end of June : &quot; the threshold , to go to Neg@@ ative towards private customers , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is hard , and it threaten the migration of investors to competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany will not please the same in the width .
destination panels : who does not buy record records ?
lonely men middle aged love records .
&quot; before you share the commentary box , to over@@ se@@ wn him under the pseudon@@ ym of non @-@ aging men with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the specific@@ s of sound plates is not attribut@@ able to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , which would like to welcome the new ones of physical objects , but to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently purchased a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght after the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyers . &quot;
there is also no hor@@ des by hob@@ by@@ ists - it has an emotional meaning : older plate far@@ es retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on television , I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy road in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and wild stri@@ d , before I ste@@ er my hands and tell something certain of the saying , &quot; &quot; so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let &apos;s take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even though the heart of So@@ hos is slowly entering its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were located , there are still a handful of fantastic records . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera to the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and minds . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , the I of S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle aged ) , a woman , presumably around the 20 ) , is one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I already treasures , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 boards . &quot;
&quot; this record , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed him home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records , which he could not afford , when they appeared and bought again items that he sold , when he was young and ple@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 1960s , early 70@@ ies who appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things that I probably was something too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend alone time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink not much . &quot;
this is my disaster .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers that he meets on the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and set themselves to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have led , people usually get emp@@ tied to their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs now to buy their records , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offers a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to WE@@ B , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record @-@ fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound@@ pl@@ atten@@ s , from objects , the bl@@ iss@@ ful je@@ op@@ ies alert . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
this is the case for me as a collector and I think it is the case with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; fl@@ utes a staff of a record pile .
&quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people purchased last month , they have not yet heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player which they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; at this point in the news report , I would probably look very concerned while I stro@@ ve through a pile of bos@@ sa Nova Komp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle aged ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the Revi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone came only recently here and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead record , so I can put them into the shelf , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; read@@ ju@@ y , less musician . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones who come only slowly . &quot;
&quot; stop@@ over , that has dedicated the record almost a whole floor , has a b@@ under@@ ed crowd when I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ ager and women middle @-@ age . &quot;
&quot; even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above @-@ standing shops - Wild Be@@ asts New Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ be@@ pack@@ er Pop instead of experimental , from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity in the customer . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks very ugly , but na@@ ve mental trau@@ mas are hard to det@@ ectable when you stand next to someone 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around the shop for a few minutes and looks at the vari@@ et@@ ess of the standing plates for sale . &quot;
it is more of a showcase than a big purchase .
&quot; it does not deserve much , so the collecting of plates is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or another way but the beauty of plates is ... it drives along with a loved si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
&quot; my last stop is a shop , told by that a new generation of record @-@ lovers is supposed to have inspired : urban Out@@ f@@ it@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; while I give the impression that Je@@ ans Hot@@ ell@@ um , I watched a group of young teen@@ ager , formed for a moment to buy Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a Cros@@ ley turn@@ tables . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one sees her to - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record @-@ art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these objects might mean more money for the industry , and some customers could send to the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave at least in record business in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record company who exist in reality , record business and in Online@@ for@@ en . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; you will not spend their Thursday morning with certainty through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while at the star@@ ing view of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator , which rises over the shoulders of the middle aged men . &quot;

French court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court has rejected a proposal from the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; in a trial period this week , the authorities argue in Cal@@ ais that the state should be authorized to sell 72 pro@@ vision@@ aries , sell hair services or tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture , argu@@ ing that these places should be crus@@ hed because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and san@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state supported and other groups were not enough to provide enough food for the growing numbers in stock . &quot;
they also led out that the provisional business and restaurants can often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there were no legal basis for expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 pro@@ vision@@ ing business , but spati@@ ally that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais are absolutely comprehensible . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ de said that the grocery stores , cafés and restaurants would play a much larger role as merely people live , live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting place between refugees and volunteers offer .
&quot; one of the places that were threatened by the fall was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des camp , which is shared and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
more than 17@@ 0.000 people have signed the petition to keep the Kids &apos; cafe .
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was that the closure for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the most recent eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Migr@@ ants estimated on Friday that the number of people rose to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep rise of new arrivals over the course of the summer . &quot;
in spite of Olympia disappointment : Martin stays a comb@@ ative

he had to analyze in peace which would have led the reasons for deb@@ acle .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany &apos;s r@@ ink must adapt to the next generation of speed measurements : in various federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , the Tem@@ pos@@ ing particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic operations of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden , for instance , can be used at random points , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on motorway construction sites or at sandy bridges with temporary Tim@@ pin connector , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary blo@@ wers for compliance with speed limit . &quot;
a continuous mobile device can however be too dangerous or consuming .
&quot; the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery holds five days , the case data is encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser @-@ measurement technology , all vehicles can also be captured over several tracks simultaneously . &quot;
variable speed b@@ umps as well as speed b@@ inger after time , lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the highly @-@ run state , one can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with a p@@ airing cl@@ utch . &quot;
&quot; so that he is not simply cl@@ oned , he is lowered in the measuring process , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and incidentally also disappear in a safe outside . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is to protect the bl@@ ater from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer for data from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states has been tested and now also used . &quot;
&quot; also foreign authorities bl@@ ush with new technology : rejuven@@ ate , France has made 100 pieces of Georgian , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
Britain wins silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold hits
&quot; the impressive performance of Great Britain on the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came in the finals on Thursday evening to a dead stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were be@@ aten up with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ c stage here in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji divided a master class in handling , side step@@ ping , re @-@ back , line @-@ run and ro@@ her strength to win gold - their first olymp@@ ic wa@@ ist of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was failed by the poor tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Great Britain on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they smote New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ finals on the same day could fall back to it in the finals . &quot;
but independently of that Fi@@ ji would have put a 15 @-@ man team in const@@ ancy in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it is probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite morning a gold medal at his neck will hang around his neck : fi@@ j@@ is Chief trainer Ben Ryan , the former head of England from Wimbledon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago she lost under Ryan of any game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
&quot; this work@@ book will be wo@@ ken , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and left the attacks GB@@ s from a lot of fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. , as if one would run into driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with just four minutes of playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wai added another attack from the right corner that he turned . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly allowed the ball .
&quot; a h@@ is@@ tive bustle of Mitchell stops the mountain by man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third gate to achieve , but it has only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner is a touch @-@ down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re@@ porter and it was still over a minute of play ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed by further weak T@@ read@@ ings of the GB team and rus@@ hed to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the rest .
&quot; it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still growing . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB resulted in fundamental changes to the semi @-@ time period and closed the fi@@ ji@@ b gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the circumstances of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua went through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started a trial for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was running long in favor of South @-@ se@@ sul@@ ans whose fans s@@ ut@@ ches , flags and danced on the ble@@ ach@@ ers . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the cake icing with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the p@@ fi@@ ff , the fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ aced themselves and GB ki@@ cked off in the lawn . &quot;
&quot; earlier this day , Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and the UK urged South Africa in a scarce half @-@ fin@@ alist match from the race - British transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored one gate among the post in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant cit@@ adel of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the gain - and therefore the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with cancer of the trainer for rowing .
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ aler@@ es Gold than with these games and what will mean .
&quot; from the first rowing back to the last , 220 hard h@@ ieve that enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though it was only those who were sitting at the Ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was omni@@ present as she used to the second olymp@@ ag@@ old in two without tax lady , the first women in the history of British sports that put on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their dominance was absolutely , after all their 3@@ 9.@@ ter uses , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins , which gli@@ de on the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ge , which is not the way of the triumph of it . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in the ro@@ ders there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of wil@@ ful hel@@ pers , who make the difference and it was no man @-@ more than the coach , who would not survive this day at all , when it was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he was risky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , the oper@@ able one and they did it . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do it , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a rather horrible situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , could start out what the break was on a minimum in case that under such circumstances is the correct term . &quot;
I needed money so I had to go back soon .
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran at the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient . &quot;
this is how it starts .
&quot; rowing in itself is already a challenge , but this makes it even greater . &quot;
&quot; in the in@@ medi@@ al of victory , their first thought of Williams , who went a nerve @-@ up morning to talk a little more than usual , and tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal arti@@ ll@@ ery reg@@ iment in an operation in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . this is perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it is only repeated how much I have worked , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach of the world . &quot;
I could not have wished for a better person for wearing or better trainers .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning has no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even at the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark have concluded , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were very in the moment trapped .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; abi@@ ding in the process , abi@@ ding in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not get started .
&quot; we had a good start and at the same time , we were not looking out to make something great . &quot;
&quot; today we did not want fire@@ works , we just wanted to achieve a good result , going out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a time for one year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV adv@@ ent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
this would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London it took about six months to understand , that I am a Olympics . &quot;
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; it feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years exemplary on clarity
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; V@@ eit@@ ing Group &quot; , &quot; R@@ up@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , goes into retirement . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; Bav@@ arian too . &quot;
a small fr@@ ame@@ ful drinking water @-@ association as a model for the large water producers .
so it was a time ago in the original book in a contribution of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
a little later the water@@ forum announced the Government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken the second association .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ ing group &quot; bay@@ ern@@ far as exemplary .
&quot; behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who was 31 years in the second @-@ association staff , of whom 28 years as managing director . &quot;
&quot; now , he was res@@ igned at the age of 65 in retirement . &quot;
&quot; drinking water @-@ purpose of the V@@ eit@@ ing group based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , with approximately 150@@ ,000 cu@@ bic meters water and supplies 32 locations and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member communities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Baun@@ ach . &quot;
for further towns and villages there are water supply contracts .
&quot; the current President , Breit@@ brun@@ ns mayor of Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler 1985 was set as a water@@ bed and was appointed as director of the Second @-@ Association . &quot;
&quot; its tasks have been very varied and they extend from the water management and maintenance work , the budget creation , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency changes on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , they called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the re@@ establishment of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , and the multip@@ licity of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there have been no stand@@ still , and you always have added any new additions , because water lives and drinking water the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in their Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o they praised Gö@@ llers , reliable and accurate service over 31 years away . &quot;
&quot; he has worked with a lot of heart blu@@ ff for its water purpose , and he has managed the water@@ purpose association , as if it were his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , he considered a real practitioner to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ ing group to nit@@ rate before the water@@ forum of the district . &quot;
&quot; for this , he received a lot of recognition and praise . &quot;
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler s@@ on the one hand praised aqu@@ acul@@ um Greeks who worked with him 28 years with him .
he is the best water@@ maker and he was a faithful guy .
together we were an unbeatable team .
&quot; as the highlights from his point of view , he referred to the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the restructuring of the Second @-@ General . &quot;
but the biggest challenge and the hardest use were the pipe @-@ quarry at the high rate of church lou@@ der on a 3rd of January .
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages with water could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; also the supply of Neu@@ brunn again can only be maintained , because one filled the floo@@ d@@ der of P@@ ett@@ stadt . &quot;
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose was handed over to Daniel storms of Lau@@ ter who acc@@ esses the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .
the sop@@ rano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko is open with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago and turns to other interested parents : &quot; they have to have the courage to talk about it .
&quot; the medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Corri@@ ere della Ser@@ a . &quot;
&quot; when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she had to die . &quot;
&quot; now , the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago was well ahead and now there was privately in New York , where it will give the best therap@@ ists . &quot;

relationship @-@ stat in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man sho@@ ots on your partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man released an apartment house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) and killed them .
&quot; the man has called themselves to us and stated to have killed his partner , &quot; &quot; said a pol@@ ze@@ al pre@@ cher@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator was on the run , after him I will be public@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown , brown and has a lat@@ ch . &quot;
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
but it is a couple of years old .
meanwhile the man is wearing a g@@ lat@@ ch .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could also bear the weapon in himself so the police .
&quot; who sees Sven S. sees , should the 110 call . &quot;
the police speaks of a &quot; association stat . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the victim is born in 1988 , the perpetrators of 1981 . &quot;
&quot; the police in Lü@@ beck wanted to make no information about the Ta@@ ther@@ or , or the relationship between perpetrators and victims ; but he confirmed that a man had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing , &quot;
&quot; more we are currently not saying , &quot; &quot; said a pol@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher@@ in in Lü@@ beck . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses therefore was a special command ( SE@@ K ) at the scene .
steel - light view of the German steel industry
the cr@@ isen@@ beut@@ ler and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in meg@@ acities .
financial stresses that threaten the industry from the cost of cost @-@ driven support are from the table .
&quot; it remains in the release from the Renewable Energy Re@@ ference to the so @-@ called self @-@ output production in the German steel industry , German Economic Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Vis@@ ag@@ ulation ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally reach negotiations after two years .
&quot; the European Commission was therefore initially planned to ask the steel producer , the gases from the ho@@ ho@@ fen to generate electricity for their own consumption , to checkout . &quot;
&quot; the steel industry acc@@ uses additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year , according to the German industry association . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the C@@ Z , there is now a sign of agreement with the European Commission for talks with competitive Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators used in steel plants will be replaced , in case of an EEG survey of 20 percent . &quot;
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission to its own power supply .
&quot; thus , the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely fixed . &quot;
particular importance have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; it is a first step . &quot;
&quot; further need to follow . &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of the emissions legislation on climate and employment objectives , IG Metall leader Jörg Hof@@ mann stated in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from the financial crisis since the financial crisis 2008 and a substantial price pressure .
last year the situation further more than the world &apos;s largest producer in China raised the weak@@ est demand for steel on the world market .
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel @-@ compliant price dumping .
in the course of this spring the situation has something relaxed .
&quot; on the one hand , Ein@@ fu@@ hr@@ z@@ duties on imported coal effect , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have turned up . &quot;
unclear is how sustainable the price @-@ up is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p remained careful on Thursday .
&quot; finally , the prices would have been more stag@@ nat@@ ing . &quot;
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p did not want to exclude closing of individual works as well .
&quot; in the German steel industry , approximately 8@@ 6,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers remain careful despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3,4 million tons , they produced less than six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , like the economic association of steel on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the quantity set back in May passed the second month . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is worth two percent below the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the Association expects an improved order situation with a rising output . &quot;
&quot; community , Spirit , Health : singing seniors good
&quot; the S@@ ingen has accompanied UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp for her whole life : as a young girl she studied the F@@ ach music , and today she sings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a senior choir . &quot;
&quot; sing me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehearsal , they feel balanced , cheerful and overall lively , she says . &quot;
&quot; right now , she is doing something good for her health and her mind . &quot;
&quot; because S@@ ingen is the same from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior . &quot;
&quot; most seniors sing in chor@@ us and share with like @-@ minded people , the joy of the music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
through regular inter@@ acting seniors social contacts can take up and maintain .
&quot; because often , social and family structures in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
this experience has also made UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp in their choir : to speak and organize themselves on the others - a choir is a very special form of being together .
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
because they are practicing a deep and controlled breathing .
&quot; who calls on his lungs regularly , also in everyday life are not as fast as the Pu@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; even though it is about getting the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; in elderly people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association for seniors . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz frequently observed that the singing or hearing of songs with older people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , himself denied the sick people suffering from long backward events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head is also demanded for a special achievement , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
at the same time concentrate on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - that &apos;s a great cognitive challenge .
&quot; especially older people living alone , practice not only on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through the singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem is growing by the singing in the choir .
&quot; to show themselves : if I am for a long time , I will be better and wak@@ en beyond me - this experience rein@@ forces . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means having little talent , betra@@ ys L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you do not sing alone - with 50 singing people , who sounds there , when a sound goes beside it ? &quot;
looking for the right offer seniors various possibilities - says H@@ ac@@ kler .
&quot; sings someone from the acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a seniors , one can easily join . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views of choirs in the area .
those who like to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church council .
you can also find many seniors in the internet .
&quot; who has no access to the internet , family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with the inter@@ ne@@ tre@@ che . &quot;
&quot; who like to sing , should join in a choir , betra@@ ying H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
sing the soul is good and has a kind of liberation - that applies to any age .
cats react sensitive as a han@@ go@@ ver on the kittens
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hanover what effect the herd of fel@@ ine on adult animals has studied .
&quot; to their surprise the mi@@ ch@@ ew did not let the males not cold - however , they counted in the difference to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognise the degree of cat &apos;s arousal on the use of the little ones .
&quot; they respond to ten percent faster on Lau@@ te of kittens , which are found in great distress , such as scientists from the veterinary University and the Medical School of Hanover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ater also react on the kittens , but always the same . &quot;
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the ch@@ ew of less and strongly aroused squ@@ ad for the males either is not percep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding said of the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; she is the first author of the study , which was published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens with the urgency of their help is distinguished . &quot;
&quot; a total of nine adult K@@ ater , and eight females were observed from the keeping of the MH@@ H . &quot;
they were played for a rod of little ones that were taken out of the throw @-@ box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ blings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more intense kit@@ ten , which were additionally lifted up . &quot;
the researchers consider their results in spite of the minor sample of the probe .
&quot; all the females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , reacted differ@@ ed to the cry , &quot; said Con@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned faster to the loud@@ speaker to play if this herd of the very sublime cas@@ h@@ ates played .
this ability may be alleged or develop with the sex @-@ readiness .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have responded at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already examined many times when people studied the reactions of women and men to baby noises . &quot;
&quot; also , some studies showed that women were sensitive to infants , as if they were already mothers or not , the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ dule . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski starts with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey against the sti@@ cking football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ sed was issued .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup , in Turkey a major football game takes place . &quot;
before the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ bishop between settlements Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul about the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as &quot; is announced .
&quot; even with the suspension of the emergency , after the overthrow in July the government beg@@ ged the government , the everyday life of normal citizens should not be affected . &quot;
&quot; but this does not apply to those who are suspi@@ ci@@ zed to belong to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the attempt . &quot;
it is also not made available to the football .
against the former Star@@ ki@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ sed the pro@@ secutor filed an arrest warrant .
&quot; according to the meantime , the South of America has been accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
Sü@@ ver shall be supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan for the coup .
&quot; although the first is true for 90 days of emergency , even until October , in fact it has the life of most Turks but as good as no effect . &quot;
the ni@@ ghtly &quot; democracy scale &quot; on public places around the country Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday declared over an end .
sport is - like all the country - split in followers and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; especially fans of the workers &quot; club , traditionally not among the friends of the president . &quot;
what the Gro@@ s of the Turks but confronted with dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter whether their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or sightseeing .
&quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be especially late to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; his sporty value presented the Köl@@ ner in the past season under proof : with 17 doors and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old completed his first time as a top@@ sc@@ ure of his organisation . &quot;
&quot; in the end game against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce , he scored 1 : 0 @-@ winner . &quot;
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and secured the podium .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; , the dis@@ appoint season for the record has an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Li@@ ons &quot; also arises in the Europe League early . &quot;
in the south of Li@@ g it only had to rank six .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed and this is the most important , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master Col@@ ect@@ as the game ran better .
&quot; first of all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 seasonal tre@@ ks were placed as a sweet@@ per @-@ sc@@ orer heads the basis for the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year @-@ old .
&quot; in addition , in the AC Florence there had been a borrowed Gom@@ ez under contract and will not be announced to the coup after the coup , &quot; because of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario however wants to come to us , he just must say it , &quot; cited the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; Club@@ chief Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; but the falls would have to be ready to disp@@ ense with around a third of his to 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; its salary in Florence can not pay . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already blocked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa must not start in Rio .
others over@@ led athle@@ tics sin@@ ner can only laugh - they are fighting in Rio to medals .
the topic of dop@@ ing is determined as before the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian s@@ mmer@@ ing in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ o@@ wa , who had compl@@ ained their right in front of the games after a dop@@ ing lock , was mer@@ ed in their start ( 100 meters breast ) mer@@ c@@ ess@@ ly p@@ inn@@ ed and bu@@ gged . &quot;
&quot; it offered a sk@@ id scenario : with a very set smile she was still sitting in the hall , and had prov@@ oked with her appearance . &quot;
&quot; when determined that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a j@@ ub@@ ber storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are many more athletes , who are going to start at the start despite D@@ oping past during the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is among the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was blocked two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since he has been running the Olympic champion of 2004 and Ex @-@ World @-@ champion even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered to be the greatest challenge of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympics and si@@ eben@@ ch World Championship in 2010 had to sit a six @-@ month Sper@@ re lock in 2010 after starting the pain of pain using ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after an operation I had strong tooth pain , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended themselves . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympics was tested in 2013 and European Championship in 2010 to 2016 on the ver@@ itable stimulation of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin .
&quot; Per@@ kovic entered the wis@@ ely intake , and has been locked for six months . &quot;
the four widest lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great Gold@@ fav@@ ors .
&quot; La@@ sha@@ wn Mer@@ tre@@ k ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics and two @-@ time World Champion about 400 m , was in 2010 positive tested and 21 months were blocked . &quot;
&quot; a means of penis enlargement should have been responsible , beg@@ ged Mer@@ tre@@ k . &quot;
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has been over 200 and 400 m of the fastest man in the world .
&quot; I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably hardly an athle@@ te have been das@@ hed so many medals . &quot;
&quot; so lost Ti@@ ch@@ on its World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after it was observed with him testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing . &quot;
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to give Olympia @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ titles 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
&quot; the likewise recognized Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille of the Olympic Games in 2008 , he received due to a great share of the International Sports Court of Justice . &quot;
with 80@@ ,@@ 04 m he is on rank two of the world list .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km Go , China ) : the world k@@ ord@@ ler and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year old World Championship in response to the intake of a botanical dietary supplement , the spar@@ se of the world @-@ anti @-@ D@@ oping agency W@@ ada fell off and ran already on 13 July . &quot;
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Pres@@ ent T@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the foreign Ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fri@@ day@@ early . &quot;
&quot; I have suffered ker@@ fs and had been treated in the hospital , but this has already been left again . &quot;
she planned her home trip for early September .
&quot; whether from the other explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ one also affected Austrian citizens , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is present in close contact with the local authorities , so cut@@ away . &quot;
&quot; at around 200 kilometres south of the capital city of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday morning in a walk @-@ out of two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ let was killed and around 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Italians . &quot;
&quot; Friday early on Friday , then two explo@@ sives went high , and according to the authorities another man was killed . &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket was reported in the morning a bomb of bombs .
in the det@@ ation near the near to holiday@@ makers popular Bad@@ estr@@ us Pat@@ ong has been injured to police information a taxi driver .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the southeast coast of the country , there was a further bomb , killing a municipal committee . &quot;
according to the authorities in a cau@@ li@@ flower in front of the prec@@ inct of the coastal poli@@ cem@@ an in the air .
&quot; finally , deto@@ xi@@ ations were calling in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ ing on the southeast coast for several wounded . &quot;
&quot; one was called from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called . &quot;
&quot; the Bom@@ ben@@ att@@ un@@ ates bear the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said army @-@ General Dan@@ ai Zei@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ ag@@ early before journalists . &quot;
we assume that this is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves on possible motives , but probably it is the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot;
also Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks which is typical for the bom@@ b@@ att@@ un@@ ate Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; on the other hand , the Thai police declared the attacks not in connection with the Islam@@ ist protest movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , one thinks that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities would have received secret services to im@@ pending attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
still unclear is the group behind the attacks .
&quot; the police dis@@ missed its officials across the country to increase security around important government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and amuse@@ ment areas . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are always smaller bombs , but they are mostly not opposed to tourists . &quot;
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace built over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the successive bombing of Bom@@ ben@@ explosive , the Austrian Foreign Ministry in his homepage recommends to achieve the instructions of Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high safety risk ( safety stage 3 ) paid for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a , as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ ac and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; according to disputes between security guards and Muslim populations , there is no need for necessary travel to these provinces . &quot;
increased safety risk ( safety stage 2 ) paid for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday made a few days after a controversial referendum on one by the military jun@@ ta .
this spatial influence is also important for the military in the years to come .
&quot; Juncker boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ Ch@@ a said , the bombs were an attempt to make chaos , while the country moving towards stability , improving the economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , which in 2014 had seized power after a phase of bloody distur@@ ban@@ ces , keeps herself to have led the kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , it has not succeeded in getting a grip on the military for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost one year ago in Bangkok the attack was killed in a popular Hin@@ du Sch@@ purely 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack on the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; is in the vision@@ ing of the Federal Minister for Constitutional protection . &quot;
&quot; according to several national offices , the Constitutional Treaty also placed the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see in the &apos; identity movement &apos; clu@@ es for efforts against the free democratic basic order , &quot; said Constitutional Court Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ did the German press agency in Berlin . &quot;
thus the im@@ migrant Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist way .
that is why we watch the movement now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and the &quot; loss of their own identity by es@@ tran@@ gement . &quot;
&quot; Constitutional Court in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - watch the &quot; &quot; identity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ did said , his authority was closely coordinated with the offices in the decision . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; identity movement &apos; try to pick their target group out where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; in general , extremis@@ ts are trying to speak with you@@ thful language often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the French Islam@@ ists just as well as right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts .
this is not true advertising for one &apos;s own cause .
propaganda is to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; recently , from several federal states there have been reports on contacts of the &quot; identity &quot; to Af@@ D @-@ politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ did said , he did not have knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type would be relevant only from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changing their aims and so is extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; thus , decisive is whether such persons have controlled influence on the party . &quot;
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase in human rights crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee income , Ma@@ d@@ ined , he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
yet we have noticed in recent years that there can be ri@@ ster@@ ous structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the free group .
&quot; it may well be that further legitimate groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seekers , against Refu@@ ge@@ e or attacks from other right @-@ right motives . &quot;
but a nationwide or pan @-@ wide control of rect@@ angle @-@ hor@@ ism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; Ma@@ inten@@ sely expressed themselves , that many attacks on the account of people were not appearing in the right scene in the right scene . &quot;
this is worrying .
&quot; many of the Tatra attacks on asylum seekers were not previously known as criminal , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have therefore committed crimes committed prior to right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different or chosen for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , who then have radically changed through right @-@ right mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is becoming the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always determine the Olympi@@ ad or world records the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the brave performance of RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics center sw@@ am of the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slow , that he was no longer able to see in the TV pictures . &quot;
he disappeared simply - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in the social networks Hab@@ te then became the viral Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a set@@ back of 48 seconds ended its over@@ run and won the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather not a sporty figure that drew attention to the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old nevertheless participate in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special charter from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries .
&quot; since in ae@@ dic@@ s most athletes run , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first shre@@ w made the lap .
some media recorded it as &quot; RO@@ BE@@ L of the W@@ al . &quot;
in reference to a &quot; abundance &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ ids &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; about him funny .
&quot; his time , he struck only with a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meters of Fre@@ isti@@ l , did not play a role . &quot;
comparisons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i for media attention .
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ atorial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 meters of Fre@@ isti@@ l alone . &quot;
fr@@ en@@ e@@ tic was fired M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i back then .
the time 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump sees the dro@@ pping electoral position not so close
the Republi@@ can candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at an election event in Florida .
&quot; if the election to the US president should be nothing , Donald Tr@@ ump already has an alternative video . &quot;
he then drive into the holiday .
&quot; loses Donald Tr@@ ump the US presidential elections in November , would it be relatively no matter : &quot; ultimately it will be either cl@@ ap , or I have a very , very beautiful , long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of Re@@ public@@ ans in a telephone interview with the U.S. TV broad@@ casting CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , be that in order , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;

G@@ FR@@ P lead enters into dis@@ closing business figures
the consumption company Gf@@ K exchanged his manager Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the set@@ backs were suddenly - but not quite surprising .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K had gu@@ essed that the chair of senior manager Matthias Hart@@ mann will be even more uncertain , the longer the success of his promised success . &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the head of Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ appoint business figures and the resignation of corporate governance is the global number five of the industry before a personalized new start .

Mr Hart@@ mann has been on the Gf@@ K top since 2011 .
&quot; but the fruit of the restructuring is still not to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business , every shareholder will eventually be rest@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; if that would be the case at BMW , that would also make the quot@@ as . &quot;

&quot; as administration director , Herbert Schmidt presented the panel , was necessary to re @-@ circulation of fees for se@@ wage systems in the market community . &quot;
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 also over@@ - or sub@@ ver@@ ings resulting from the previous calendar period .
&quot; in all three se@@ wage rates , Schmidt established that it is located at all three se@@ wage systems by relatively small facilities with a very low waste of waste , which lie between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; for example , due to the small distribution of distribution , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would affect gra@@ vi@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the se@@ wage in all three plants is slightly declining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the period of its age in all three plants are not least due to its age of san@@ itation and repair applications in a considerable extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for world pole , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt dis@@ missed that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged due to a damage .
&quot; in the p@@ umping station which have had to become outdated for nearly 20 years old , and in the pond @-@ position Lop@@ p had to be extended after almost 20 years of operation of the first Kl@@ är@@ g , the Kl@@ är@@ g provides and an additional load option to be able to keep the water legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; to these extraordinary expenses came into account the advanced maintenance and maintenance costs , which are considered to be considered in the new cal@@ cul@@ ation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which at the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 are still considerably below the current level . &quot;
stone houses made clear that in the case of small wast@@ e@@ water in the three plants the expenditure for operation and maintenance .
&quot; he added , extended Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment costs in the wast@@ e@@ water systems in the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to remain prec@@ arious for a long duration , especially since one could not extend the supply area of se@@ wage @-@ purpose Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal for these facilities , because it is a deficit of deficit . &quot;
Bulgaria charged for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first about zero since October last year as positive 0.@@ 2 % have been charged .
the annual average stag@@ flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.9 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.@@ 0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 was compared to December 2015 ) -@@ 0.@@ 2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was compared to July 2015 - 0.@@ 2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , the following groups of consumer goods has been observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1,8 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.@@ 3 % ) ; &quot;
&quot; prices fell on clothing and shoes ( 2,@@ 2 % ) ; Mo@@ bili@@ ar , household appliances and rout@@ ing expectations ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.@@ 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the prices remained as in the pre @-@ month at alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education remains unchanged . &quot;
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; anim@@ e &quot; effect critic@@ ised as Asian caricature
Sn@@ ap@@ chat tells that this filter is inspired by anim@@ e but some observers say that it &apos;s impro@@ ensi@@ tive to breeds .
&quot; with its filter tool allows Sn@@ ap@@ chat about 150 million daily U@@ ses , to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is already absurd as absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into an pine@@ apple , a dog or a piece which might be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are imm@@ emp@@ tive , stub@@ born tools that generate more than 30 million selections per day . &quot;
all mis@@ steps will come to the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past critic@@ ising that the app Black@@ face supports or white skin as beauty ideal .
&quot; as this week some U@@ ses proposed a filter which gave them slots , wrong teeth and raised che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist caricature of Asian - &quot; yel@@ lowing . &quot;
they asked whether this repeated inspec@@ tors have rejected a bigger issue that the company has with diversity .
&quot; the news and the rebellion were widespread on Wednesday , with reports of The ver@@ ge and motherboard , one day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat , that it would have disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as an homage to Ani@@ me @-@ characters and not as cartoon by asi@@ an .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders , the se@@ gregation experienced , the filter reminded of hur@@ ting cl@@ is@@ che@@ ers . &quot;
others refused the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American arts @-@ student , whose twe@@ et have been widely used over the photos that the filter was &quot; &quot; hur@@ ting and mild &quot; . &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the contrasts of a very conflic@@ ting Asian cartoon and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not successful , but that the yel@@ lowing was drawn into the extreme . &quot;
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crossed this cultural cle@@ at .
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diet and integration , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed in terms of race as their older opponents - could be more of them to expect sensitivity .
&quot; when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters create an image that is irrelevant for a user , &quot; it is much harder that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case before , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Zh@@ u , Zh@@ u , who was working as a product manager and engineering working for medium , delete their sn@@ ap@@ chat account and called for others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said they believe that r@@ ence @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the interference in Sn@@ ap@@ chat . &quot;
Zh@@ u critici@@ zed the great part white , only male leadership position and ended its approach using a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that are working there , but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the Sn@@ ap@@ chat mostly left un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish any numbers on the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , there was sn@@ ap@@ chat starting to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a speaker , the company has recently hired a staff member who focuses on sub@@ ordin@@ ated population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Zh@@ u said in turn , that she is closed her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not o.@@ k@@ . &quot;
&quot; military guide fal@@ si@@ fied ISIS intelligence information , represents the Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military members of the United States Central Command changed after@@ ward information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual states on the spot could have allowed , the investigation committee of Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the provisional report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the force of force , intelligence services , and of the Wehr@@ macht , reported by great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analy@@ st , reported how prec@@ urs@@ ors changed their in@@ estim@@ ations to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; news services , which were typically con@@ genial by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Kom@@ man@@ de@@ uren , has regularly marked a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual states on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; made a newspaper article about the report . &quot;
&quot; what has happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering when poor analyses are presented by our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can become a member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership errors in Cent@@ Com range up to the top top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed enduring problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi armed forces .
&quot; although there is no direct references to that government tips given under Obama &apos;s instructions , the reports shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their pr@@ un@@ laws , an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements prior to Congress were clearly positive than it corresponds to the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com An@@ ders announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s can already start in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; Mike Pomp@@ ei@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress from K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of the Central Command changed the following reports to play the threat of ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force into life , after playing them that analysts are concerned with regard to the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State . &quot;
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations will continue .
&quot; in addition , further investigations into Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the General Secretary of Defense Department . &quot;
democratic members of the intelligence service have published their own findings on Thursday with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted trial for the creation of down@@ grade assessments to IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; gave the highest @-@ level democr@@ at in Kom@@ mit@@ ter , member of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. ship , &quot; delayed the publication of retrosp@@ ect reports , &quot; said the mor@@ als under analysts and &quot; gave over@@ ly little space for smo@@ other opinions . &quot;
but Mr. ship and Democrats have found no evidence of an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com analysts at the Cent@@ Com analysts .
the preliminary results of the investigation of Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by investigations by the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Pentagon , which were included in complaints by Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a spokes@@ person of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not be reports of Congress , while the investigation of the general spec@@ tro@@ op would still be under way . &quot;
&quot; but he also gave that &quot; experts sometimes quite diver@@ ging opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defense . &quot;
the investigation has re@@ perc@@ ussions about the question of a successful air campaign among American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defence ) .
&quot; the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of what President Obama can rely on Central Command at the Central Command in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism in terms of hearing information about the Islamic State remind of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a writing about how the then Government of George W. Bush looked forward to the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation of occupation in Iraq and little time on it to make thoughts of the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year the team asked Mr. Hoo@@ ker after entering government offices that were contrary to the statements of the government air@@ strikes against the financial situation of the terrorist group as this provisional refinement would have taken place to sell oil on the black market .
&quot; however , this realization was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legis@@ lature by members of the legislative situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of the women &apos;s show@@ down with Great Britain before
&quot; one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually be a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , she could not remember that have ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I do not belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
&quot; however , that knows them : the American players are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which remain un@@ be@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday last round of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which the two will reach the first and second place within their group . &quot;
the first @-@ placed man will take a little longer out of the road that lead the other group to the other .
&quot; like the game on Saturday , the Americans have spar@@ ked a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they landed in the last London games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
B@@ AM was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey club in their hands ( her two older sisters played the sport on the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , since they could not qualify for the cad@@ res . &quot;
then came the year 2012 in which she and her team went wrong .
&quot; in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team , and thus began to turn things to better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental transition and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
&quot; we did not have the work place in London , which we now have . &quot;
we can be able to tear the rod completely .
on Thursday morning B@@ at the Tor@@ rei@@ gen opened up in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the se@@ area .
&quot; India had gone out in the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed itself surprising and kept the game level from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she carried a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and lu@@ te the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 guide . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who so far had to book a gate in any of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
exactly like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will we depend on Saturday the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the R@@ age of Olympic Games , the Zen of trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly changing and in@@ escap@@ able , a fast run between competition and quest . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if the olymp@@ ic F@@ ack@@ el itself would be a burning st@@ ab that is handed down from wr@@ ist@@ she@@ ers to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athle@@ te . &quot;
&quot; you cannot switch off the TV to listen to a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbors in the queue , without Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ co@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there are Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s s@@ warm with di@@ m@@ ples , could certainly have been among these known names , built up to Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ emp@@ athy if he would be a swi@@ mmer , Tur@@ ner or even fen@@ cer . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights in the olymp@@ ic trampoline for gold . &quot;
the olymp@@ ic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event equally .
&quot; further from the center , partially in the shadow are the sports that are not generally recognized : air@@ brush shooting , ar@@ chery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast@@ swim and may it be for a long time .
&quot; but if I would like to do arguments for my particular lover , let me direct the attention to the discreet char@@ me of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline has already been a Olympic event since 2000 it had been a debut album , it was the last 16 years that many people I ask , did not know that it is at all a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the US sent athletes to go to competition , it has never won a medal in a trampoline and had an athle@@ te until 2012 , which made it up to the final . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Can@@ adi@@ ans for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline has a certain out@@ sider model , partly because it sounds for the un@@ resolved ear pass@@ able for a Clo@@ wn@@ s@@ schule as the one for the Olympic Games sound . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ful tre@@ mb@@ ling of his never to end clou@@ dy - but also the Grazie of the g@@ ymnasium and diving , the two sports which it is essentially united . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging winner jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , he@@ els and sal@@ tos ) before they land at the feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympics , they are evaluated according to the execution , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ one athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the common Olympic V@@ ector is straightforward .
&quot; med@@ all@@ ists must continue in their quest for gold , faster , upward , and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes and return , upwards and down in the playground . &quot;
&quot; they do not only chase the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the raw wall , but also in television transmission : the world or the Olympi@@ ad of the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; pur@@ pose@@ ful pursuit is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a audience . &quot;
but it is also what I think even when choosing these games as something tired .
of this the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a advance movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ all@@ t , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes upwards , then down@@ wards , then effortlessly back to the top . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no h@@ ectic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves to the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition with the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the Streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; those of the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the ends as part of a afternoon block on two days from 14.@@ 00 .
&quot; in the middle of the Olympia Man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in general turmoil . &quot;
&quot; if the awareness of consciousness can only be achieved through the showing and the lenses of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his way to rin@@ rin@@ se , new fans . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , long an allies of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators to challenge political changes in Ethiopia have to call on violent resistance from the government .
witnesses say that zig prot@@ esting while clas@@ hes were killed with the police at sc@@ iss@@ ors .
is Ethiopia just going to be together ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but during the last few months , protests against the government broke out the country and spread out into ever more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people rus@@ hed to streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was un@@ mer@@ ciful . &quot;
witnesses gave witnesses that poli@@ c@@ emen were shot in zig @-@ armed prot@@ esters and killed .
&quot; there are few videos about the protests that probably come from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people beat young people with st@@ aves , while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN authority for Human Rights now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa from the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded at considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pend@@ ul@@ um train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even though Ethiopia was anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organisations have continued continuous oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited , whereby Dis@@ count became effective for silence . &quot;
&quot; many were put into exile , or sent to prison , or sur@@ passed into the deser@@ ts of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you sup@@ press people and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot;
the whole youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the land of land to the stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a long lasting election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now monitor 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time tensions continue along the border to Eritrea ; a battle for these jag@@ ged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ ga@@ des who have been more or less forced to exploit turbul@@ ence over the last few years .
several factors explain why feelings of the bitter@@ ness after years of age in front of Hin@@ kö@@ chel@@ ns can now explo@@ de .
the first appears harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in the last few years many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate via social media , as cheap smartphones have always been more frequent and improved the internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government lacks access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are staying . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave them to meet the protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since ae@@ ons prosp@@ ered the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from ae@@ dic@@ ation predominantly Christian high@@ lands , in politics and business , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but even this is changing .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests found in the areas of the Am@@ hara and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray that constitute about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military , in the secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the unrest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was until his death on a non @-@ known disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; he was considered tactical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
&quot; analysts say that he was particularly obs@@ essed in it , early signs of dis@@ content and use special officers to process opponents and make them in@@ harmful . &quot;
&quot; the present regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively un@@ attended reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray Region of Nord@@ ä@@ Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. Hai@@ le@@ nav@@ am comes from the South . &quot;
analy@@ st say that he does not have the confidence of the confidence of the Tig@@ ray @-@ controlled safety services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time , that Ethiopia was experienced such a turmoil in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , who were seemingly fu@@ elled by the government according to data analysis , and subsequently stolen by the government . &quot;
&quot; during the following swe@@ eps , many prot@@ esters were killed , even though it were less than in the last months and that time of distur@@ ban@@ ces were relatively quickly over . &quot;
&quot; development experts in Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new pend@@ ul@@ um train , as well as their measurable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of internal abnorm@@ ality of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ esting in gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ian city , of Tig@@ ray guided shops and the hatred against the Tig@@ ray is becoming more common in social media . &quot;
analy@@ st say that the protests the US and other Western allies are bringing in an independent position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring of Somalia , even though she recently voted on that she has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West doesn &apos;t want to support democracy , he does not want his ally collap@@ sing in an already volati@@ le area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin grass . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama was founded ISIS &apos; sar@@ cas@@ m &apos; .
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to all@@ ay the last controversy that surrounds his campaign by being ang@@ ab that his repeatedly repeated claim , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State , not seriously meant . &quot;
this clari@@ fications gave new questions about the communication capacity of the candidate &apos;s candidate to be aware of whether he is able to communicate and communicate with the American public .
&quot; it also brings his collaborators who make an effort to take it during an event@@ ful phase in protecting , into the peculiar position to explain statements that he could not have meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after having made the clear@@ ance at an election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump in regards to the claim on Thursday and ins@@ isted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate , the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday said Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was just sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was opposed to the previous day , on which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump , wanted to weaken the statement anything by causing him reminded that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him , wanted to know the Republi@@ can candidate . &quot;
the final storm of criticism bla@@ ze down on Mr. Tr@@ ump while he attempts to direct the focus of his campaign due to random orbit values on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches for the economic situation in Michigan in this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this issue again . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ ton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
&quot; at the end of July he attracted strong criticism as he said , the Russians should h@@ acking Mrs. Clin@@ ton emails , but later he said &quot; Of course I said the sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it is one of its methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of consuming the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has taken an even higher tone as its re@@ frac@@ tion@@ aries have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , who was published on Friday , showed a guided tour with large lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump in general tries to apologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics , to dist@@ ort his statements or to understand his humour . &quot;
&quot; but while he rein@@ forces the focus of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze have brought his loyal contribut@@ ors to the in@@ convenient situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative may also be his statements . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York , and one of the most sought @-@ prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was interviewed for the accuracy of Mr. Tr@@ umps , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back @-@ pigs , completely false , and therefore it happened because he pulled troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most of the mainstream Re@@ public@@ ans attempt to argue that the government under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton , served as an external Minister , it allowed ISIS to spread out the situation in the Middle East and under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania in Pennsylvania , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and cast them out of riding upon each of his words and be taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he hid the &quot; poor , &quot; t@@ wilight &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t know it ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democrats have spot@@ ted above Mr. Tr@@ umps as only one more proof that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; pushed back over the price of the market , café in Green@@ point comes back &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a s@@ lim@@ mer café in Williamsburg in which one could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years a good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from its Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ Front has been pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , which replaced Ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sold soap in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes . &quot;
native people mour@@ ned as the last loss in a gent@@ we@@ ather@@ ing city .
&quot; the Artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ er wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is changing , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b now is a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York change is , then it is also a new one . &quot;
&quot; a restored Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is also still good .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafes . &quot;
he began to work in 2001 at Ver@@ b and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when he offered a customer to provide money for a new outside , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , held a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same Esp@@ res@@ som@@ ed@@ ine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he also wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ni@@ ings such as cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted oni@@ ons .
there are Natur@@ re@@ iss@@ ors .
&quot; the cafe does not serve beer anymore , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he has noticed a st@@ amped stream of old stem customers .
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices of Williamsburg , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Williamsburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she was moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way . &quot;
&quot; after the black@@ out had closed , she gave a while the coffee @-@ t@@ etr@@ ack , she said . &quot;
&quot; I realized that it was on the coffee and the culture in the Ver@@ b , who fell to me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee , even though they ordered this day instead of their usual I@@ ced Coff@@ ee@@ ee a bl@@ ended cha@@ i Tea , which is another new supplement . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long@@ time and loyal customer since the beginning of the proclamation in 2003 .
&quot; he went there before the work , and he always ordered the same . &quot;
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; photo Rodri@@ guez said , he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu . &quot;
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal getting its usual order , but sometimes he switches his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he won &apos;t have a res@@ eller that the so@@ ap@@ ing has taken the old business space .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , offered a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold bre@@ wed coffee of the coffee @-@ in as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go to their offer , &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez said . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish residents of Green@@ points have also accepted the café as well . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into the Polish and Rodri@@ guez said that he has pre @-@ established , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has other advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ local wants to fill and sell the cold bre@@ wed coffee in the bottle .
there is a chance that the café expands to a newly created building .
for many customers a new verse is sufficient to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was Chief Apostle and said that he was destroyed at the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the bed of the Lok@@ als and the bri@@ des felt a new coffee like a home@@ coming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; an abundant meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roo@@ sev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
as a delic@@ acy President Roo@@ sev@@ elt had a f@@ ai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acy of Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water turtles .
&quot; its menu on this day was a bit more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , mas@@ hed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with lei@@ gh people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ography .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; was about the Chinese cuisine in the USA , whereas in its book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; was told in her book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; about life in a residential house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest cooperation , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , as they met with a re@@ porter in the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , sn@@ ak@@ y snack at Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the IP@@ crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh virgin sand@@ wich with olive trees , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato p@@ ü@@ ree and vegetable mixture ate . &quot;
&quot; when the Reporter has ordered h@@ ackers ordered , this was the couple for discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there was pe@@ an@@ ut , liver cheese and bean . &quot;
&quot; they were prepared from an ingredient and a little bit , that is the ingredient . &quot;
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts eating that they serve them as dinner .
co@@ e gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have put itself in the stomach such as lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ e@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women cooked for male rock workers and it became freshly baked past@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner served . &quot;
&quot; the Americans were imprisoned during the first World War foods on a hungry Europeans . &quot; &quot; A Square &quot; &quot; paints the paths with which the country was killed , no longer to be the lar@@ lar@@ ing country . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , tense theme , &quot; beg@@ ged co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; just as tense was the new bud@@ get@@ ary thing : mysterious dishes like bre@@ ads and cas@@ ser@@ ese were used to stap@@ le food , food remains re @-@ confi@@ dently , &quot; noted Zi@@ egel@@ man , because chefs could hide un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients under a scre@@ aming sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper drought .
&quot; meat , which was the center of the American cuisine , became a rare in @-@ fourth luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculiar compounds have been tried out , since a cal@@ orie swe@@ eten@@ ers had priority to taste or even healthy cooking . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , prepared ornam@@ ents a dish from this time , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular supplement on the mid@@ day , &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons do not fit together to each other .
it was typical for many of the utility recipes .
&quot; as never before or since , flo@@ ated appliances - including Louise Stan@@ ley , leader of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - the eating habits of the country @-@ like . &quot;
&quot; by using recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; household police &quot; &quot; and the challenge to transform the pamp@@ as like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square meal &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historic tit@@ bits . &quot;
&quot; in particular , tasty , the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ food @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple Iowa farms of his kitchen , he p@@ iste like the millions @-@ heavy man of the world to which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked Continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost gold @-@ in @-@ room and had a smo@@ king .
he was deli@@ ght@@ fully realistic .
President Roo@@ sev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have prompted him to stat@@ ure him with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the recru@@ iting of a house@@ keeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs Roo@@ sev@@ elt , that the White House brought the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most dri@@ fts . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , deal with food , was rejected as soon as the country came back on the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as science applied to foods . &quot;
the pair gave the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man in law better understood - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the extravag@@ ance of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man rec@@ alled , &quot; She actually made people ill . &quot;
there was the wind explo@@ iters .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they went and co@@ e a dessert that they had dressed at home : the pl@@ um that ate the president Roo@@ sev@@ elt . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a nasty trick , modest recipes sent a fancy name . &quot;
&quot; there was no s@@ worn cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone emerged somewhat reluc@@ t@@ antly a spo@@ on in the fence , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
surprisingly it did not tasted bad .
co@@ e won three times a stroke .
&quot; like a Can Do Bud@@ dies , he said to his wife , &quot; A pair of ch@@ opped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
in bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life in the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ki@@ cked everything to save others the life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died in a façade attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group who saved the life according to Bild @-@ Newspaper barely 6@@ 0.000 people . &quot;
2@@ 900 volunteers put their own life in the game to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil protection , which shows him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a baby from the ruins of a house , went to the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syrians about the shining symbol@@ ism in the Gre@@ ys of war .
&quot; as a hero , he never seen himself , said according to picture : &quot; for me that is the true Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die , save life , I think that God sees me a mar@@ ty@@ r . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Omar fell into an attack against the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attack in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have four fac@@ bombs above the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ ophyll . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing not . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the poison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb , so that no children are playing with it , &quot; the image quoted his last words before he died . &quot;
the mortal bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ one is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland is usually only in winter to surface .
this Ha@@ i was allowed to go back to the sea after an examination on board the research council .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic Ocean until today .
Greenland - only received with 150 years of offspring .
&quot; painted flo@@ ats along the ground of the North Atlantic at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is just 1.@@ 220 metres far . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes to arrives , the five meters long animal acceler@@ ates to s@@ atte 2.7 km / h - and with this maximum speed half as fast as a Rob@@ ine . &quot;
this has a long life @-@ shaped lifestyle but seems to be a silver bul@@ let for a high age .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the Copenhagen University and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from a Greenland , the 3@@ 92 years old could be . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; said Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein from the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demographic research in Rostock , this life @-@ span , which means for hurri@@ cane a world record . &quot;
&quot; though , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist already pointed out that Greenland is st@@ ony old . &quot;
only l@@ acked the evidence .
&quot; Greenland is difficult to observe , after all , they mainly live in the polar sea front of the spar@@ sely populated coastal regions of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water @-@ temperatures around the six degrees cel@@ sius , they appear in the surface mostly only in winter . &quot;
&quot; about the lifestyle of Greenland , researchers know accordingly little . &quot;
her Zeit@@ lu@@ pent@@ emp@@ o measure her as they exp@@ elled six animals by a transm@@ itter six animals with a transm@@ itter .
&quot; boot@@ y make this shar@@ ks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the rem@@ n@@ ants of a Rob@@ be , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
&quot; possibly they chase them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the ground of the ic@@ me@@ eres , and seek car@@ c@@ asses , that tor@@ ches out from higher water layers to the bottom . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a hub from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimeters long , while the largest 50@@ 2 cen@@ tim@@ etres measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , analy@@ sing them with the Carbon @-@ 14 method the Lin@@ sen@@ kers of Ha@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is already born before the birth of shar@@ ks , which are contained in the proteins that are no longer renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ er .
&quot; after the early 1960s , their birth should lie greater quantities of this radio@@ active carbon carbon into the atmosphere in the early 1960s . &quot;
&quot; in the case of 220 centimeters in length , the third @-@ smallest animal contained a small excess of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday at its investigation in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all major Greenland shar@@ ks had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts , that arises through cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years long Greenland an age of 3@@ 35 years , during the record @-@ shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimeters , even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ females only then get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers were able to assign the length of an age .
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters are probably at the br@@ ink of sex ripe , and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland with the multip@@ lication is obviously at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
even this might be the case for vert@@ ebr@@ ates at the moment .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland whale , whose sp@@ eck at the neck was captured a 120 year old Har@@ po@@ on tip , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , there is often the organism of the animals living there on austerity . &quot;
so you mature then later - and al@@ tern slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are also often very large . &quot;
&quot; because volume is growing much faster than its surface , through which the animal gets heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one grams of mouse is therefore much greater than in one gram elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous , and should concentrate on as many descendants as possible as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary an@@ ologist Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; however , a very big animal should invest more in a long life on the other hand . &quot;
construction background in a double pack
&quot; with topics around the building , the council at the most recent meeting has been focused on the focus . &quot;
&quot; with relief the panel took the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally , the marketing of the recently designated living areas can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the property , par@@ cel@@ ators and lock@@ ers have been clarified and the applications for a survey could be made , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; road road &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße - Ex@@ cer@@ ation section 1 ) to interested parties is nothing more in the way . &quot;
the council is convinced that the blo@@ oming in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au young families and hat@@ ched seniors as well .
&quot; as it was meant , we can immediately report construction sites in the Town Hall , on the allocation of the plots , the council is expected to be advised in his September meeting . &quot;
&quot; to also request requests for the relocation of further commercial enterprises , associated with the creation of jobs , subsequently , the Joint Council , which will only be re @-@ created in the spring of this year in sub @-@ areas . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the field of under@@ mining it is already a proven commercial business by two plots towards state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; the city of the Main Event has today in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg to attract the best opportunities to reloc@@ ate jobs and companies . &quot;
&quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ xit V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the Compet@@ ence &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to run from London from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot;
it is now sufficient for the so @-@ called EU passport to give them approval in the UK .
this is especially great US banks .
several banks have already announced their jobs .
the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; anticip@@ ates 10,000 new jobs on the Main River five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , so the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , has united responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro zone , as well as other important agencies such as the European insurance view E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have their headquarters , but this is less important for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the staff is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in Luxembourg , a large fund sector , but also cut off as Dublin for the infrastructure , as well as in the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the big airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the town with easily available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Seine , the r@@ ents for premium commercial properties are 50 percent higher than the main ones . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt has a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the company consulting Mer@@ cer , the city is ranked seven , Luxembourg on position 19 , Dublin to No.@@ 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot; refuse the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; but despite Bre@@ xit @-@ V@@ ot@@ um of the most important financial center in Europe , the economic researchers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the correlation of forces : in London they worked according to the figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba end 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking sector , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives right costs from the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S.@@ -@@ rec@@ ti@@ fier decided that Gilead sciences are entitled to the reimbur@@ sement of the legal costs that you have emerged from the Hep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June , Gilead were freed from a claim to claim of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster @-@ medications So@@ val@@ di and har@@ oni of Gilead , after a US judge a pattern of mis@@ behavior from Mer@@ cks , including opinion and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; during the complaint of the law@@ suit on Thursday , U.S. resignation of the Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to decree of the cost , which arose during the defence of the F@@ alles . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck attempts with Gilead , attracting the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver illness . &quot;
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck took other def@@ endants and ownership of laboratory work , the Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir attributed to the active ingredient in the medication of Gilead . &quot;
the United States supported troops to say that they have re@@ conquered full control over Man@@ bi@@ j by the Islamic State

&quot; the Democratic forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) comm@@ its after the moving of the remaining remaining group of fighters who settled within the city , currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they have delivered over 2,000 civilian people who were held by the fighters as ho@@ stages , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish , with the D@@ KS military council Re@@ uters . &quot;

&quot; Clin@@ ton candidate for the Vice President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax notices in the last ten years . &quot;
they paid an effective Federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ t Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ hel@@ per was announced in Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; in a cr@@ ass contradiction , Donald Tr@@ ump hides behind false exc@@ uses and extrac@@ tors in relation to his previous promises to publish its tax credits . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax credits , although they are not obliged by law because of this . &quot;
&quot; tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated as a reason for its denial , a tax examination by tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ t &apos;s electoral campa@@ igning in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the presidential and Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ umps special advis@@ er , to CN@@ N that he would not permit Tr@@ ump to release some before the control tests are not completed . &quot;
&quot; trac@@ umps critics , among other things also the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 , have already been sil@@ ver@@ able that its ref@@ usal questions arise regarding assets , his donations for charitable organisations , its business and various other compounds , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already been over@@ thrown on the subject and published on Friday a video on the internet in the high @-@ level Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump to publish its tax statement .
on Thursday she also talked about a speech about the economy in Michigan .
&quot; he refused to do that which has done any other presidential did@@ did@@ actic in the last decades and to publish its tax instructions . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico has reported that Tr@@ ump paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted a series of tax hav@@ n and tax consultants , the indications that this might still be the case . &quot;
federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme which is named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would make sure people earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama supports the proposal also .
&quot; during an election event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ator @-@ gl@@ omer@@ ate has its headquarters here , Tr@@ ump to exchange at a meeting to exchange their tax credits . &quot;
&quot; he said Buff@@ ett , he was also subjected to a tax examination of IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; before the voters and not before the tax authorities . &quot;
Clin@@ t &apos;s campaign has made the tax statement back to the year 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ t , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective Federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between the years 2007 and 2014 and an effective tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0,5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax statement of the Clin@@ ton of 2015 showed that this only USD 100 of their income is related as wage , unlike most of all Americans . &quot;
&quot; its main funds was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ ic dividend and income of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were pet@@ ri@@ fied . &quot;

Jewish director broken Berlin Hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots , en@@ gros@@ sed a media watch , after he betrayed that the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli pre@@ election , since it would have requested Arabic guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Holocaust @-@ documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his trouble in the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
during his last stay Lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find Israel on the outskirts of the hotel .
&quot; the country was not listed between the countries , which can be called directly out of the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new German , possible that Israel eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; saw him , &quot; &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote . &quot;
&quot; the hotel agreed that the measure is a &quot; inten@@ tional decision of the management of Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reason behind it stood , solved in the director even more anger . &quot;
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs , and they have demanded that the election is deleted , &quot; the employees of Lan@@ z@@ mann has been quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ trade man called this a &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and upset by this event .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this has resulted in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident prov@@ oked a fairly large resonance in the internet , in which people called the whole a scandal . &quot;
some sub@@ ordinate the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel that it would have given the alleged &quot; Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; ashamed you , &quot; &quot; was it in a different post in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the pos@@ h Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all the accus@@ ations of themselves and called the incident to &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , tells Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel does not include in the quick@@ ening list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung writes a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel . &quot;
it adds that the country @-@ election has been added now .
police puts Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mi@@ le@@ osse against prot@@ ested Brazilian students
students came together on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they were gathered to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public education system .
the police took Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ mi@@ ra@@ de against the prot@@ esters .
the difficulties began when police officers were trying to con@@ sp@@ ade the students what led to the police officers and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals by the governor of the Bundes@@ sta@@ ats Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools will be closed while 300@@ ,000 students are being implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the protest leaders saw gra@@ ff@@ i@@ ti@@ ts against the provisional President Michel Tem@@ er at walls .
the recent protests occurred several days after prot@@ esters in masses on the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff that had been dis@@ missed by a vote of the Senate concerning their desc@@ endant from the office .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade agreement between Moscow and Tehran in the year by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran has been lifted , the interest in Russian companies in the country grew strongly , distributed to the amb@@ ass@@ adors . &quot;
Russian companies gain existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , the further trade fair is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trade show between Russia and Iran rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , the Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amoun@@ ted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; the trade agreement was reached by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan runs for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign representatives gave around € 3@@ 5.000 Vis@@ as , primarily Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , of Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , which concerns the population of the economy in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Irish tourists in Russia from last year , broken , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; personally , I can recommend the visit of the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ raz and Y@@ az@@ d who received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims at the gate of Mer@@ cy
the Min@@ is@@ tran@@ ts from the past@@ oral unit E@@ ł@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the road on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together four stages have been tac@@ kled .
&quot; in order to bridge the time up to the next no@@ stri@@ pe of all min@@ is@@ tran@@ ts over two years , the upper round of St. Anna has decided to prepare for the preparation and execution of a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; different pilgrimage objectives have been tested and one finally decided to take place in the Bishop of Freiburg , where in this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from Bitt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and hal@@ ero@@ oms made their way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before the pastor Stor@@ es sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and shared the pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b the railway station was driven by rail to the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where also a Münster of Bel@@ ser@@ er , is standing and so the pilgrimage from the Mu@@ enster . &quot;
&quot; the individual day trips were met in the morning and in the evening , depending on a short impulse with various prayers , songs and scrip@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; but also on the road , the Min@@ is made at field cross@@ ings , chap@@ els or churches , and again re@@ ast to sing together a song of especi@@ al pilgrims @-@ Li@@ ed@@ he@@ ft . &quot;
for the nights we were at your disposal of the local par@@ ishes .
&quot; at the Et@@ app@@ rais@@ al Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller for a sav@@ our@@ y , as well as a meal for dinner and breakfast . &quot;
continued on the second day over Fur@@ tw@@ ave to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; tags you entered the stage to St. Peter who was the road to St. Peter , who had to desc@@ ended at sul@@ try heat at first approximately 500 metres altitude and again . &quot;
the earned reward was a common gri@@ lling in the evening at the Bad@@ ge .
after the morning impul@@ sion on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter it went to the Schl@@ us@@ set@@ appe to Freiburg .
clearly facilitated and happy the Min@@ is met at the late afternoon at the Frei@@ burger Münster and under@@ went through the gate of mercy .
with a small impulse there was thanks to God .

after the divine service the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ r@@ isty and the altar .
the next day was time for the Bre@@ is@@ gau@@ ge metropolis .
afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
&quot; in the end , all participants agree that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience was marked . &quot;
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hed at home as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling .
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ging last evening in the male team @-@ Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for glory , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the quer@@ ade role which had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y to emigr@@ ate . the young and made the legend proud when he rus@@ hed to tre@@ ach@@ ate a victory from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
&quot; England claimed for four years ago a shocking victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympics . &quot;
she repeated the trick after she took place in March at the railway World Championships in London despite the return flight just a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the substitute for the Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as Hin@@ des .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap that K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton attempted to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man where they remained when they saw the potential in the sh@@ ot@@ ters that un@@ folds now .
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y and Sk@@ inner in the qualifying rounds of a Olympic ord , but in the stand @-@ round the New Zealand was victorious on the first lap . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ des was close to his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a large part of the transformation , in which Hin@@ des in a higher course went to slow it and enable Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to hold the pace . &quot;
Ho@@ y saw from his position as an BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des that came up on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am just here to do my best and make a name for me .
in the final @-@ dogs we have placed a Olympic ord and defeated the world champion .
it was simply unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 at the page Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys made Hin@@ des that he fell down after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such a victory , there was no such problem for this time . &quot;
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; it feels like London with all the GB of the grand@@ stand as London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
&quot; we have come so badly with so many global titles , that it was incredible to win again at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were seven of 10 titles in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; when a bar@@ ometer of our progress has been in the last five months , we expect successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the area of imagin@@ able that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; this would mean for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a apparently sacred date for the British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger B@@ ann@@ ister was born ) - a explo@@ iting of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
this would be the same thing of Ho@@ y .
&quot; Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int , which begins today and go over three days . &quot;
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lonely to win alone .
&quot; saying , &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be be@@ aten to the k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only med@@ all@@ ists contest of the day but there were further good news for England .
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the Vi@@ er @-@ four @-@ o@@ dom@@ eter race . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 in the destination .
&quot; the world ch@@ ord , which in 2012 won gold , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; today , the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of competition , at the Wig@@ gins and safety . &quot;
he had disputed yesterday with respon@@ dents before the qualification when he called function@@ aries to measure his body size .
&quot; in the relative case of the women &apos;s competition , the tomorrow continues and ended , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in World k@@ ord@@ era in 4 : 13.@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team is leaving its strong railroad team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick a swe@@ ar of medals .
&quot; after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were driven down . &quot;
&quot; drama &apos;s drama in the background , so the resignation of the technical leit@@ motif Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton played in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and bullying , as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ leton . &quot;
&quot; however , if one sees the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite afterwards , as could the now legendary call GB@@ s that has reached its peak again , again to be repeated . &quot;
future of the melting of Port@@ land due to lifting energy consumption
&quot; the future of the aluminum de@@ mel@@ tdown from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work stations of workers - stand at the game , since the system operators will cancel the energy supply contract , and thus withdraw all delivery contracts , such as the supplier supplier . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
one for 20 years set up for 20 years in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be endangered at a closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to Dom@@ ino@@ x effects , as the melting bon@@ ding around 10 percent of the total electricity generation is consumed . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the point of Henry Sch@@ mel@@ zer@@ ei , which resulted in the closure of the an@@ es@@ ea power station last year . &quot;
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risk to closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of speculation in the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian currency , and finally due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminum melting together with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared with that three other owners will cancel their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the complex is mainly owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese companies CI@@ TIC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p will hold smaller pieces . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continues to continue to operate the plant in Port@@ land , which means another physical demand for electricity through the melting system , &quot; shared the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continues to be said that the &quot; &quot; backup &quot; &quot; contracts should have come into force as of November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; from that point , AG@@ L is assuming that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
&quot; all potential impacts on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong cash markets for wholesale prices . &quot;
AG@@ L shared with that the value of the contracts were already written in its annual down@@ turn in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in the expectation of a cancellation .
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... &quot; to operate the melting shop or to ensure the power supply to the melting . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said that in 2010 it entered into force a 20 @-@ year deal with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have taken effect from November this year , even if it is still a declaration , why it came from the contract . &quot;
analy@@ st warn of the poor economic conditions of the sector before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melting shop in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land annually consume around 600 mega@@ watts , and Tom@@ ago about 900 mega@@ watts . &quot;
&quot; should both facilities disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as power producers , this would be not good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a car@@ das@@ h@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ ri and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner Clan@@ s Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der is and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this Co@@ vers for wines , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ v@@ eiling of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ like family ? ) , said the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner family , as well as the presence of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ ly@@ n , as well as the presence of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ ly@@ n , as well as with a classical turn : they have all planned a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the cl@@ aff@@ able action nearly every birthday in a children &apos;s return ( Se@@ ac@@ nant brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You called that we had forgotten you ? &quot; , &quot; with the honesty of a cartoon animation at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity . &quot;
&quot; with a view of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , the new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an began . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls big sister Kim likes them , as far as the Vo@@ gue cover cover , have be@@ aten ( they and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a League for itself . &quot;
the September issue is the most effective issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resembles more images than a fashion magazine , the output pul@@ ls a large number of advertisers ( L@@ aut ph@@ hi@@ on@@ ista ) , from the 8@@ 32 pages of the grove ( 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his co@@ ver@@ stars will be so lon@@ ged that in the last two years pictures of the magazine reviewed yet before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover cover Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; celebrities &quot; , &quot; the Mod@@ ules &quot; as &quot; Mod@@ els that are celebrities &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot;
Oscar @-@ lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
&quot; but even at the low chance that Ms. J@@ enner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; break@@ age &quot; &quot; of their generation - under the previous category , it is in good company . &quot;
these celebrities are not related to famous individuals or Reality stars or young people from today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true for J@@ enner ) .

&quot; of course , Jen@@ ners does not like success to anyone . &quot;
with its Reality @-@ TV history Jen@@ ners was always tense in the fashion world .
in June the introductory Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called them &quot; the M@@ ist@@ pieces of the moment .
these feelings feel high again when the message with the appear Jen@@ ners came out on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but on the mis@@ grace riding seems to be passing by the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sold her made pictures from Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LOVE .

common centres in 16@@ 0.000 people per year
&quot; more than 16@@ 0.000 inhabitants of the country have been rejected annually by the coun@@ ties of the country , while the industry is transferred to the effects of further intermediate abbrevi@@ ations to already over@@ sized transactions . &quot;
&quot; there are already three of five persons - mostly older persons , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ants and similar services - in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly illuminated , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June , next year , this legal centers will lose further 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot;
&quot; the director of the Municipal centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Council centers revealed that thousands of people have already rejected thousands of people every year . &quot;
Far@@ rell said that the situation was only worse without a repe@@ al of the Federal Government .
&quot; the que@@ urs of the country centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and op@@ pressive debts , families who have been released by divi@@ ders , workers who have un@@ just trouble - all these people have problems of a legal way and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government will cut the funding by 30 percent as of June 2017 , meaning that thousands of helpful people from Queensland are forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call for the General Staff General and Bundes@@ judicial Minister as well as Sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to lift up these intermediate abbrevi@@ ations , so that people need help they need to receive legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the national government met its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to view the needs of common centers and their customer communities , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump Elec@@ toral campaign charged after employees allegedly moved weapons
new York : Donald Tr@@ umps Camp@@ a@@ ign has been indicted for alleged im@@ in@@ action after you have been informed that their struggle manager for North Carolina in February were directed to an employee while they were traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , which was submitted on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software program@@ er for the campaign in this federal state . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ i gave me to have waited for months that the matter would be internally regulated , before he realized that &quot; this would not happen . &quot;
&quot; the struggle manager , Earl Philip , &quot; moved a gun , placed his right for@@ ef@@ inger , and r@@ ammed the course in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i gave in his charge . &quot;
&quot; after having described himself with the local and regional struggle management , B@@ ordin@@ i noted that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he gave in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired in order to cause damage , &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i gave . &quot;
the prosecution only comes after two days after the Republi@@ can candidate call an rebellion as he should take action in North Carolina to take action if his ri@@ val@@ ine Hill@@ ary Clinton will be elected and judge should appoint .
&quot; Tr@@ umps Camp@@ a@@ ign clearly stated that media would have removed his words from the context , and that he would not complain about violence . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ is complaint requires damages from the campaign to breach of duty duty , and of Philip for body violation and lasting psychological damages . &quot;
trac@@ umps press conference in Hope Hi@@ cks was not able to reach an opinion .
attempts to contact Philip was also missing .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news station in Charlotte , announces that Phil@@ lip does not last longer in the campaign . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey on countries of countries : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the forthcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , there are significant losses for the SPD , SPD and CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; this will be representative of the opinion research institution , IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while red @-@ black governance in the north could continue to reign in the north , this is not possible after the survey in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and therefore would have good chances to pursue the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD pl@@ ung@@ ed from 3@@ 5,@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party still sm@@ iles just shortly before the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would be at 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented with 19 percent for the first time in the country . &quot;
&quot; despite slight losses , the Greens are hesit@@ ant with 6 percent ( previously 8,@@ 7 per cent ) again into the heav@@ y@@ day of the country . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 percent in the country &apos;s day .
&quot; according to the Berlin Chamber of Represent@@ atives , the SPD of the survey conducted only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 2@@ 3.4 per cent .
they still sm@@ iled behind the Greens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) but before the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 per cent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at 14 per cent for the first time in the Chamber of Represent@@ atives .
&quot; with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the Pir@@ ates would be missed in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9@@ 000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Time lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the sequ@@ el today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device wei@@ ghed nearly half a kilo@@ gram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thicker and bigger , so it was not good at hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite knock . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was initially eight Meg@@ ab@@ y@@ tes , which would range today for about two sel@@ ectively with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ yte .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9@@ ,000 communic@@ ator &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , lovers can still buy the equipment on the Internet , but they come somehow from the era of the internet era . &quot;
20 years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at the Computer@@ messe CeBIT in Hannover as an &quot; office in the West@@ ent@@ sia format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails were sent and received , also by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
even access to web pages was possible via HTML @-@ browser when spra@@ ying slowly .
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be stopped like a laptop . &quot;
then we found a little keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
&quot; quite proud was the price : 2@@ 700 D @-@ Mark , therefore about 1400 Euro . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was in 2015 at 3@@ 92 Euro .
nobody could imagine in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything has been different . &quot;
the smart phones are a success story as well as not for Nokia .
&quot; the mobile @-@ saving of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and handled . &quot;
&quot; today , the market today dominate the provider , which came much later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for very many people in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; sold about 1.4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple at least 5@@ 55 million copies . &quot;
the worldwide sales with the equipment is about 400 billion euros .
these are the well running shops of the paid app providers and telecommunications companies .
there have been a whole industry around the smartphone in the meantime .
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came to the beginning of 2007 , then Apple leader Steve Jobs announced on the Mac @-@ World the introduction of i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communication , easy to use on touch screen . &quot;
&quot; starting from Apple began , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market they had to see . &quot;
they disappeared finally , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
now the seeds have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after his invention a matter of course .
&quot; on the cut , each German now looks for 88 times a day on his cell phone . &quot;
&quot; we all need to learn to put the smartphone again , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina sco@@ op , in the Siemens Board of Directors for staff . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
&quot; He@@ a@@ throw is not only used in our local municipalities and in the whole of London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; for me , it was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as at that time in 2012 in London , when we run a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved again by creating new possibilities for local residents and companies nearby He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities , we will continue to create 10,000 new teachers , 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , it will be such that will think that the challenge of enlargement He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too large . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ aming ourselves on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had injustice and they will be wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to rec@@ ede but He@@ a@@ throw answers every question asked .
like the Olympic Games He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individual a infrastructure project .
&quot; enlargement is a way to create up to 18@@ 0@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to swe@@ ating growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs to leave both the airport and the whole of the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have been a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has been implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure projects in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best transit terminal was built up to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequencies of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to supply a third running tour , which is supported by a £ 16 billion to private investment . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
&quot; it is time for us to ste@@ er this olymp@@ ic spirit and to expand He@@ a@@ throw , as well as create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of the UK . &quot;

&quot; block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and Maus@@ play &quot; &quot; on display @-@ block &quot;
&quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising money , according to one of the software companies attempts to handle ad block@@ ade , a &quot; K@@ atz@@ - and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that ad lo@@ osen up on his desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus a blo@@ gger post , in which it communic@@ ates that users can update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his Des@@ k@@ top@@ us would change the enco@@ ding with respect to his advertisement , to display it display , which is part of the site advertising to complic@@ ate . &quot;
but Ad@@ block declared that there was a new way to deal with new codes .
&quot; in a blo@@ gger post , the spokes@@ person written by Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er battle has been underway since the invention of ad lock@@ ers , and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media has been established in the battle , is a powerful indi@@ an that has become worrying indication for the industry . &quot;
&quot; according to a study conducted by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people worldwide , use some 200 million people ad @-@ lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion every day active users who access Facebook on their mobile devices , mobile @-@ advertising 84 percent of advertising revenue took fac@@ ebooks . &quot;
&quot; the company has no effect on ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , because mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on fac@@ ebooks mobile app for social network and inst@@ agram , shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient large proportion of revenue , so Facebook appears to invest in such a step as re@@ warding . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would be &quot; &quot; ad prize pool &quot; , &quot; to have more control over it zi@@ pped advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook stated that Ad@@ block would dis@@ regard new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not commerci@@ als . &quot;
&quot; for users this is not a positive experience , so we are planning to address the issue , distributed an speaker from Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we concentrated on development tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences , in order to get more control over the hands of the people . &quot;
woman with suspected su@@ icide on Swiss highway over@@ ride
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witness to seeing a woman in the early hours of the morning on Thursday at a suspected self @-@ su@@ icide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud just after midnight .
&quot; a woman slept in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; &quot; on the street and were taken by several cars , the police in V@@ aud said . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a sweat at the age of 49 years , used by several vehicles , including a truck , was driven to kill herself . &quot;
it died on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police , who calls this as well as any witness to the incident in order to report . &quot;
&quot; it has opened an investigation procedure , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation divided Gilles Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gene@@ ve . &quot;
however it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a clash of avoidance ?
&quot; this is something that the pro@@ secutor has to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held accountable .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran into the dark on the highway - was decided that motor@@ ists don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian right in the middle of the night is running on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
&quot; last year , a poli@@ ce@@ ist of the neg@@ ligent killing has been acqu@@ itted after giving a man over@@ ride and killed , which was in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and has become unconscious on the street . &quot;
&quot; the court noted that the police officers -- who responded to a call -- on a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely extraordinary and unfor@@ es@@ een situation &quot; , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has more information on the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges , should report on the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA climate @-@ od@@ ell : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably formerly hab@@ itable according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies in NASA have developed a model to detect the past of Venus using tools and algorithms which resem@@ ble those of climate research .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere was once rejected similar conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow re @-@ rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin , a similar atmosphere and nevertheless slowly expanded . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably proved to be more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and to be sc@@ anned out more quickly . &quot;
&quot; the early Venus benefited from a sun , which was 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation simulation expon@@ entially the slow re @-@ rotation of Venus its daily side of the Sun almost two months long , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ med the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like a rain @-@ screen to aver@@ t the surface from a large proportion of sun@@ war@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; the result are average temperatures , which are some degree of cooler than the Earth today . &quot;
the model carried out a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously assumed by planetary research .
&quot; although it was formerly hab@@ itable , the Venus -- in the course of several billion years --@@ too much heat and ultra @-@ violet light was exposed . &quot;
the oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was blown away by the ultra @-@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide stayed with a deadly greenhouse gas emissions -- the Venus , which as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy enters the trainer &apos;s trainer
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and vice president of Ho@@ ckey operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a sligh@@ test co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately search for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; over the past three years I have met my duties as chief trainer and vice president Of Ho@@ ckey operations in the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; expressed the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; over the course of the summer , I thought as long and much about how I could improve this team in order to give it more depth , this requires and bringing it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the Vision of the trainer and vice president Of Ho@@ ckey operations must be perfectly adapted to the organisation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a co @-@ determination right in decisions that affect the performance of the team . &quot;
at the moment these conditions are not met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who announced Roy on 23 May 2013 , thanks him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me about this decision today , &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy has been awarded the Best Trainer of the League during his debut season 2013 @-@ 14 .
&quot; he led the association on 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was be@@ aten and missed in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed the post @-@ season in each of the last few years . &quot;
the description recorded in the season 2015 @-@ 16 a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the Wild for a second game spot in the Western Conference around five points .
&quot; as Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the description . &quot;
Nor@@ des@@ dic@@ raft workers resume talks again
&quot; the work struggles regarding the remun@@ eration of Nord@@ se@@ e@@ öl@@ workers are exposed , while all armed parties for a new round of conversation at the table , they said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; strikes against the oil @-@ service providers - Wood Group carried out spor@@ adic@@ ally on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell . &quot;
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ites and r@@ ammed trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution of the current struggle , &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot;
&quot; we will stop some day @-@ day meetings in the next few weeks , which will start at the beginning of next year to re @-@ address the problems early next year . &quot;
&quot; the trade unions said their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , a protest against possible wage abbrevi@@ ations of up to 30 percent . &quot;
wood Group has abbrevi@@ ated the rates to its contrac@@ tion in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the ratings of the company follows a 10 @-@ percentage drop for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the needed space to come through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; Shell has released for his part of thousands of people released and announced plans to abandon his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it ration@@ alised his business activities as a result of his me@@ ating relationship with the British energy company BG Group ration@@ alised . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are located on the basis of lower crude oil prices under pressure , an economic situation that has been abandoned by the decision of the British in June , the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish parliament@@ arian Member Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders in the beginning of this week , in order to discuss one of the greatest unemployed , which happened since a generation in the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few &quot; , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; 2016 will be expected to spend less than $ 1,@@ 1.4 billion spending on new projects in the North Sea , compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures Rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ tel@@ escope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the full catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the star @-@ horses of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
&quot; the new data will help the astronom@@ er to understand why stars in the star cluster may rot@@ ate at different margins , as well as in which connection with the planetary development . &quot;
&quot; we hope that we experience through the equ@@ als of our results with other clusters to learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Centre in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this constellation produced around 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood . &quot;
they are now turning on the fastest .
&quot; to peak rot@@ ational rates , these str@@ apping stars meet large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; because these winds travel through the stars of stars , they have a brake effect on the stars . &quot;
when a star is alternat@@ ing its rotation rate begins to slow down .
&quot; Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of every star , taking the time between the show of an recognizable star -- like sun@@ spots -- recognizes . &quot;
the latest catalogue of Rot@@ ation rates pointed out that more solid stars revol@@ ve slower than a less massive star .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with a larger star slower st@@ rou@@ ters turn off as smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; b@@ allet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas quicker rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ate qualities as rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older &quot; , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still a lot ahead of us what we would like to know more about how the wh@@ ann and why stars slow their rotation rates , and speak to their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and their colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the A@@ stronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball star will start
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in best days of base to base .
&quot; after his emotional review , the 41 years old pro will be transferred on 12 August against the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays a last time the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team .
&quot; I say &apos; Goo@@ dbye &apos; to the &apos; , the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times , Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player of the League , 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series . &quot;
&quot; his signature , under a ten @-@ year contract brought him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the contrac@@ tion on 31 December 2017 , he will be working as consultants and youth @-@ coach - with full content . &quot;
as player paid there Rodri@@ guez a long time with performance .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 H@@ its and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; &quot; R@@ uns &quot; &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es managed to make some milestones . &quot;
with the Hall of Fame @-@ Fame H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays only two further bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics .
&quot; however , in the glory of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is unlikely to be recorded . &quot;
&quot; because so successfully Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; was on the field so controversial his appearance is outside the plaza . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , the Super@@ star was announced at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 banned mortality . &quot;

Rodri@@ guez is regarded as the main suspi@@ cion to have received funding for years over an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a legal dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 because I played a break for 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez then . &quot;
also his farewell @-@ days did not go quietly .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games once again get the big stage , Rodri@@ guez had to sit frequently on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;

&quot; Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa and Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski are first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing tasting the wei@@ ght@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski from Poland in Rio does not start .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by the first official dop@@ ing .
a bl@@ ur@@ ly athle@@ tic could have gained almost one medal .
&quot; in front of the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro have become known . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese s@@ mmer@@ ing in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 meter obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa in Brazil have been positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the anyway critical , athle@@ tics cont@@ ests arrive at this news at the moment . &quot;
&quot; at Ch@@ en was already proven last Sunday the Di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de , which is used as a mas@@ tic means of dop@@ ing distances . &quot;
the International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took place in the finals over 100 m butter@@ fly , only around 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medals . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the pre @-@ courses over 50 m of Fre@@ isti@@ l . &quot;
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of B @-@ sample and a hearing for the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; the national association accept the matter &quot; very seriously and demanded by Ch@@ en &apos;s full co @-@ operation with the investigations , &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a Communication : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ Court CAS and will accept judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS of the sanctions of athletes with positive cases is responsible . &quot;
also in the night of Rio St@@ oo@@ ed the message about the positive trial at Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa through which 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it be inno@@ cent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said to act with the forbidden substance to act at the EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa has been suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B sample is also already positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s prime minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov worked out immediately with criticism of the athle@@ tic word .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians stand under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
thus about all weights from the chronic dop@@ ing nation may not be part of Rio in Rio .
&quot; on Friday the case of &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski &quot; , &quot; the London Olympics in the class up to 85 kg was tested as a positive effect on the an@@ abolic stero@@ ids N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both openly deny the intake , but both may not start in class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the athle@@ te , Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa is another severe blow to the reputation of the entire sport . &quot;
&quot; the world association IA@@ AF had the complete Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing the start is prohibited , even the L@@ ent nation Kenya produces in Rio numerous bad news . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming pool , the earlier closures in China had also taken care of fierce conflicts between the athletes . &quot;
thus the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympi@@ asi@@ eger Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ le li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; if I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ isti@@ l , I want to pass me , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also the centre of a confrontation with the Australi@@ ans M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun had been positively tested with the Chinese champi@@ onships more positive , but had to sit down only a three @-@ hour lock . &quot;
Dat@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ pressed h@@ ackers their ran@@ som
programmer of black@@ out mal@@ ware currently resor@@ ting to a targeted company - and have been successful .
&quot; according to a current survey of the Mal@@ ware @-@ defense specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surve@@ yed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , partly several victims of an attack with black@@ smith software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies already finish the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware yield . &quot;
40 percent of victims paid by the perpetrators requested to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetrators speci@@ alise their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes on attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potentially extingu@@ ish ran@@ som falls much higher than in private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of damages , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetrators will be discovered for themselves .
&quot; first , private users were the goal , but the change to company attacks took place in the past months fri@@ ghtening . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works for a simple pattern : once upon a victim &apos;s computer , it looks for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ cloud , Excel or database files , as well as archives and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als .
then the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
&quot; to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims must pay money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where private users use the personal photo database at stake , it is about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production tac@@ it . &quot;
&quot; accordingly higher the damage fails , if a ran@@ som@@ ware fails . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German firms generated sales losses by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to break the business completely , in case of a case people were in danger . &quot;
&quot; in Germany there were several hospitals victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of sickness . &quot;
&quot; we say to the victims always : paying not , you only promote the problem , &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies , who pay , get their data back . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of perpetrators compared to a stand@@ still . &quot;
the h@@ ackers again know that and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the security researcher of F @-@ Secure took the use of F @-@ Secure , and come into contact with the comp@@ iler and come to the result : the perpetrators are actually trying to establish a kind of customer service in order to take more money . &quot;
&quot; you declare their sacrifices by chat on how to pay by Bit@@ coin , direct support websites or de@@ code free example files . &quot;
&quot; and will trigger private people after payments of a few hundred Euros , companies need to be partly hard to negotiate and five @-@ digit sums up to retrieve their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the Ran@@ som@@ ware degra@@ dation , the h@@ acker will always professional and share the work , the safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of anti@@ virus @-@ provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
&quot; more likely , it is that it is about three or four persons . &quot;
the programmers sell their pollutants in the form of a software building on the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the recent mal@@ ware kits emerged by the mal@@ ware itself , consulting and additional tools for a single , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; included in the package is an adaptation tool , so that minor configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ ser are then looking for further h@@ ackers to spread the newly acquired software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so you log in one of the forums in the background , buys the set of a crime and asked another to install the software on as many PCs . &quot;
the payment is made per in@@ consistent machine .
&quot; usually instruc@@ t the criminals then sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that better secure their data .
&quot; over 50 percent of the companies @-@ IT leaders trust in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey , to be able to rep@@ el the ran@@ som@@ ware using file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful Er@@ p@@ ess@@ ung more , the perpetrators may be explained instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the damage potential for the type of data is still a multiple higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpetrators will be able to take completely new goals on the internet of things in the future . &quot;
at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrated safety researchers as they could get under their control using the internet .
&quot; in the middle of winter , the fre@@ eing of such a block heating system could certainly be a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ator then instead of heating in the future a whole production street in a factory block , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be an issue in the industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and all @-@ day @-@ free
&quot; in the little HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little S@@ UV , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini@@ vans . &quot;
&quot; sounds pretty clear , but the HR @-@ V , who was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the F@@ ond . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top falls out there . &quot;
versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in storage .
&quot; it is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l with high @-@ placed and 10@@ 26 l with um@@ bled back @-@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the sitting areas of the back@@ bank can be cl@@ ap like kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel and thus offer storage space , which is high from floor up to ceilings 1.@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be well loaded , however the load height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
&quot; the tested 1,6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas , very powerful . &quot;
&quot; however , he is likely to do something qui@@ eter . &quot;
&quot; well , the everyday consumption of 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km . &quot;
there is yet another mot@@ orization : a 1.5 @-@ l @-@ gasoline with 96 kW / 130 HP .
a All@@ ra@@ dan drive is not offered .
&quot; driving is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering is likely to be a little direct .
the equipment can be found in the tested top @-@ version &quot; Executive &quot; no wishes .
&quot; among the security systems the City Not@@ brake super@@ visor ( works up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ isions @-@ war@@ system and the split @-@ resistant super@@ visor . &quot;
&quot; the coll@@ isions sometimes irrit@@ ates sometimes , because in Ran@@ ges many obstacles referred to as &quot; her@@ ann@@ ah@@ er objects . &quot; &quot;
very reliable works of the television super@@ visor .
and the intelligent Tem@@ por@@ k re@@ acts on the road detection and d@@ ros@@ ges on demand the speed .
&quot; however , the full connectivity is only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI @-@ jack are under the arm@@ rest and therefore are a bit awk@@ ward .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 Euros for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel diesel are OK . &quot;
&quot; who does not want to invest so much will receive Ben@@ zin@@ er from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 Euro . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 @-@ emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V Honda offers a versatile and exclusive car @-@ free car .
Air@@ line is not liable : down@@ fall on the passenger bridge
an Air@@ line is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
&quot; because a liability is conceivable only with dangers that are typical for air traffic , argued the Upper District Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken up with the overthrow of a knee injury .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of living , so the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
disease cases : when paid the organizer
getting sick people get back after their trip only if the cause of the illness is des@@ perate to be found in the hotel .
&quot; however , this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the latter case , a family was heavy on the second day of their tur@@ k@@ ur@@ ry hard to diar@@ rhe@@ a and vom@@ iting . &quot;
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
their illness led the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a def@@ ective se@@ wage plant that supposedly had poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family had been the view that the trip had been de@@ fici@@ ent - and mour@@ ned against the organizer .
court had no success in court .
although the se@@ wage plant was in fact def@@ ective .
but the organizer was only just before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ zer .
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; thus , he has not violated his obligations , thus the judgment . &quot;
especially since in the samples of the water no de@@ contam@@ in@@ ants have been found .
&quot; the disease of several hotel guests - perhaps by infection among each other , belonging to the general life of life . &quot;
from 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 dise@@ ased .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said many people were worried about refugees in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach in July .
the State had to be denied and resol@@ utely to terror at the same time .
&quot; for sure , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hate and division . &quot;
this triumph we will not treat the terrorists .
&quot; if the offen@@ ders had to leave the country more quickly , the level of security and strength , also the consent of the population for the refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to implement the proposals until the European elections of 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another personalized rein@@ forcement of security forces , and indeed &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ sized scale &quot; &quot; over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ ies for terrorism must be under punishment again .
&quot; video surveillance is said to be improved , the weapons can be used in such a way , that above all , the purchase of weapons will be created on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the last much discussed welding , for doctors should abide by de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words . &quot;
&quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the doctors &quot; cure , &quot; as the threat to citizens could be reduced , he said with a view of psych@@ ic symptoms . &quot;
&quot; to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the minister maintains a better social care necessary . &quot;
teachers would have to be better prepared to deal with traumati@@ zed people .
&quot; for the persecution of criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of the investig@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to security . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Interior Minister clearly spoke against shareholders . &quot;
&quot; this was one ear for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel spoke the newspapers of the radio @-@ group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double citizenship .
&quot; for a general ban on enforcement , it has been constitu@@ tionally problematic . &quot;
&quot; you can not prohi@@ bit everything you re@@ jects , and I rest the wearing of the Bur@@ ka . &quot;
talking about rules on traffic or for witnesses in court .
green boss in Simone Peter threw the Minister before he wants to simul@@ ate with ever new anti @-@ terror packages and action .
&quot; left @-@ party manager Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet offspring and a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the living right bring people in this country no more security . &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway
it was regularly on the water@@ way road - here a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the law of law should be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all car drivers , who stand in the professional traffic on the ambient road every night in St@@ au if they drive over the highway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; the road operation is extended to the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Street and the departure of Wes@@ eler street , at 700 meters . &quot;
car drivers can then turn right from the hammer street on the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic is at the early age , whereby the total increase in the procedure on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 will be improved . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the train station on the Zu@@ br@@ inger nervous the car above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
the back @-@ day from the back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes also beyond .
&quot; reason , the con@@ i@@ hr on the B 51 is shortly before the departure of Wes@@ eler street . &quot;
&quot; from here , traffic can only be guided through the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be recovered from a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had yiel@@ ded that the bridge has no longer the required hydro@@ electric power , in order to record above all the heavy @-@ load traffic . &quot;
&quot; how long this Eng@@ pass and the associated @-@ daily St@@ au will last , the responsible state can not say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to reck@@ on : for the bridge has an official rest period up to the year 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal bi@@ e@@ cho@@ ur , the country has deliberately picked up the traffic weaker period in the school holidays because with disabilities . &quot;
the traffic will be run on Tuesday and Wednesday by lane on the job@@ site .
intercultural journey : culture offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the Theat@@ res &quot; The Inv@@ isible House . &quot;
the Club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre now plan a music project .
the N@@ ima Club allows for young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible house &quot; of the Young Theater Münster .
&quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; N@@ ima &apos;s initi@@ ates &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; &quot; 19 pupils between eleven and 15 years were the staging in a small house . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with migration and migr@@ atory background for the purpose of visiting schools with welcome classes , as part of this project cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most young people of the class were come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria . &quot;
&quot; thanks to chore@@ ographies , the sati@@ an images and video animations it had been possible to follow the course of course , so the press release of the Young Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg from spra@@ kel , and the Young Theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December teenagers should be accompanied with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years old , professionally managed courses in singing , dance , spectacle and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the field of the@@ atri@@ cal and the@@ atri@@ cal language education are in the planning .
the project &quot; Intercultural Jour@@ neys &quot; goes on .
&quot; given the increasing refugee numbers , the association deals with many classes who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of star@@ ring : hope for weather training
the weather has taken the star@@ ring sho@@ cks in the South@@ west of Germany during the night for Friday to go through the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was badly suitable for clouds and rain to observe the sky spectacle , said the chairman of the observatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night for Saturday .
&quot; the weather is supposed to be good , then we see many star@@ ters in the sky . &quot;
&quot; in the constell@@ ations , it is per@@ sil@@ ky , which belong with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the fastest star@@ ring . &quot;
&quot; they have their names , because they apparently come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes on the northeast . &quot;
relaxing Night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evenings one gets eternal , at night you can wake up for hours , at night is already far from the wake @-@ up and no longer think of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , these problems are in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep and more than ten per cent feel frequently or permanently rest@@ ful . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes in them , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ aving , a member of the German Society for Schlaf@@ es and Schlaf@@ es . &quot;
&quot; what one compre@@ h@@ ends among them , is the In@@ som@@ nia , so a inhal@@ ation and sleeping disorder . &quot;
&quot; just the sleep many people feel as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , Jens Wagen@@ knecht , Board member of the German home medical association with practice in lower Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what lies behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleeping disorders are complex .
&quot; behind it , organic , mental or mal@@ ign@@ ant factors , but also medication are stuck . &quot;
not rarely is the disorder expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early it is above all with depression frequently , &quot; says We@@ aving . &quot;
and it may be that various factors appreciate each other .
&quot; for example , who has a sli@@ pped disk , can be bad , guarded every two to three hours and begin to greet you about everyday issues and care , there are We@@ aving an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should you talk to your doctor ?
&quot; who is not well asleep over a month of one month in at least three nights per week , and in the day is imp@@ aired , should go to the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the impairment may look quite differently : one is tired , tired , un@@ exhausted , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has m@@ oods or physical discomfort such as stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate the sleeping disorder , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; as a treatment options , among other things behavi@@ oral changes , a cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also drugs - classical dor@@ ms only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ question . &quot;
&quot; even in Germany , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary and Medical Center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , one should first contact the doctor &apos;s doctor first . &quot;
this may clarify with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should get into the dormit@@ ory , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; to study in the dormit@@ ory physician , medical advice , for example , in snor@@ ing with respiratory disorders , in path@@ ological day@@ dness , or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , explains Fi@@ xed . &quot;
it really does not have to prepare for the study .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; just please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; says Fi@@ xed . &quot;
after the c@@ abling one goes to bed at his normal time .
&quot; besides electro@@ des on the body , one carries a nose @-@ up , a chest strap and a anten@@ na@@ e at the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera is characterized by the ceiling . &quot;
how can people cope with the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adju@@ sting screws on which one can put a better sleep .
&quot; We@@ aving counts on : regular bed@@ - and lifting times , not too long in bed , do not sleep too long in bed , do not watch TV to sleep , alcohol and watch at night - then you start immediately to reck@@ on , and this is quite and not at all con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler expressed himself down by Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V @-@ Team at the Olymp@@ us .
&quot; in December 2014 , he was for the first time in Doha at the Short World Championship in Doha , and at the same time presented his first world record . &quot;
now the former DS@@ V @-@ athle@@ te Markus Dei@@ bler has placed on Facebook sc@@ iss@@ ors in front of his ex @-@ team members .
&quot; in a country where a Olympic champion gets 20,000 € premium , and a jungle heads 15@@ 0.000 € should not be missing any missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old during the night to Friday on his fac@@ ebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in the swimming pool is bad , the Dop@@ ing controls on the other hand is very good . &quot;
&quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote very much and do not see it exactly on the topic of dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; I do not say that the controls are to be adjusted , &quot; he stated . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first start by the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is how you should keep it with countries too .
&quot; whoever cannot be controlled a certain amount of time before the WM / OS of independent controllers of the W@@ ada / fin@@ a may not take part &quot; , &quot; demands the choice of Hamburg , who now runs an ic@@ ir@@ ele . &quot;

&quot; in doing so , they had a total of more than 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; built up to old buildings , a few lin@@ ens cou@@ pl@@ ings , in between still a rest of the cob@@ bl@@ estones : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrichs@@ ha@@ in affects the first glance not so , but the police ranks her to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; if one walks along the road from east to west , one gets along play@@ grounds , a fresh@@ water kinder@@ garten , and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
to the facade of a gray house someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot; kn@@ itted .
&quot; opposite a Li@@ d@@ l , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , is already built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments . &quot;
&quot; article on this &quot; trendy neighbourhood &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichs@@ ha@@ in calls , but in the last weeks however preferred by burning cars . &quot;
&quot; reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents of lease , on the ground floor are still spaces occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin cour@@ sen@@ ator Hen@@ kel had spoken many times for a hard course of the police against the project , the area called &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for poli@@ c@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after on 22nd June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ iede , were cleared with 300 police officers , pat@@ ched up three weeks of official statements . according to 30 to 40 officials and three teams in front of ground , blocked parts of the street and kept visitors to enter the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners the rooms . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin @-@ Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clear@@ ance was illegal , and a day later , police and builders headed by sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the street works peace@@ full : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking vor@@ y late . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there are a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
&quot; left violence is not the main part of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer who lives in Kiev since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who runs three children here , are mostly gener@@ alized from the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the domestic projects , they share the concern before rising r@@ ents and cent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound like a p@@ ou@@ z , which is mainly forced to take tri@@ bul@@ ations against v@@ and@@ ali@@ on left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , who made the Berlin cour@@ sen@@ ator and the police between domestic and their neighbours , does not seem so manifest . &quot;
&quot; Friedrichs@@ ha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which also has a low average income in comparison to the rest of the city . &quot;
also home @-@ occupied and the natives of them are already long in the Kiev : in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer street near the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been cleared at large police officers , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who were occupied 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district of the last few years has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and constitu@@ tion@@ ers from all over the world : they now divide the inhabitants from GDR and former home @-@ occupied areas . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to the r@@ ents , which has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
&quot; many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes it in the s@@ wollen sli@@ ces , or newly designed fac@@ ades , which were thrown with color . &quot;
no other street was mentioned so often together with the words &quot; centre @-@ autonomous violence &quot; .
&quot; one reason that not all neighbours might consider this as a problem , be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as bodily injury are based almost exclusively against poli@@ c@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the most part of the crimes make hard@@ damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lived for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94 , there may be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as far as violence is concerned , it is important : people in the 94 are their neighbors , which have not been determined . &quot;
also the famous burning cars give it right in the Rig@@ a@@ er no longer .
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary , &quot; &quot; one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße - and remained .
&quot; it was therefore also that it was so important that the inhabitants returned to its road : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of the inhabitants like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to take away : through sighted new buildings in former buildings , which sup@@ press the ancient inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately con@@ domini@@ um , which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so good be@@ tu@@ cked &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely no longer exchange . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but what should one be doing , if someone never listen to someone ? &quot;
&quot; it sets out on all sides of frustration , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; admittedly , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding about colour @-@ bombs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the home@@ work and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; who draws , should be aware of this - just like someone who goes into a tavern district to complain badly about noise . &quot;
&quot; all persons presented only with first names have asked , not to be called by their right name &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer .
&quot; in addition , it is a social worker in front of the ground . &quot;
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le was the refugee camp for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social pedago@@ gical team supports the administration of the agate in Gro@@ cken@@ berg .
&quot; she sees himself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , work and refugees , authorities , authorities and anyone else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ gh W@@ oll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau who has above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; so , some - less spot@@ ting rather than on the multitude of requirements wish to be pur@@ pose@@ ful - meant as the administration wanted to write the position . &quot;
&quot; he was looking for a administrative force with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long experience in the field of social work , even a reli@@ ant wool sau . &quot;
&quot; but administration is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is going to work to work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been with it for around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent location for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le Ehr@@ - and full @-@ term actors are supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and insur@@ ing problems . &quot;
soon new containers are available in the Was@@ enstraße
a serious problem is it for some time to find apartments for connecting people who have been acknowledged .
the municipalities are responsible for connecting the municipalities .
you must accomo@@ date the refugees in their own or rented areas .
&quot; the cost of construction , rent or refurb@@ ishment of these accommodations must take the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility extends from the Office of the Commune at the Commune and in the Job@@ Centre .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been designed for some time and very difficult .
&quot; de facto , the management does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it is not possible to rely on private apartments , so deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we need to be in common apartments as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so , new containers will soon be placed in the washing road . &quot;
but only with apartments is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed base , there are intern@@ ships , educational sites , school sites , one @-@ euro jobs and ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ation for refugees and migrants that need to be collected or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house master , perform non @-@ profit work - and this motiv@@ ates and very neat as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive out@@ ward effect .
&quot; this is no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not mean only work .
&quot; the day need a solid structure , say deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people need to develop a belonging feeling .
&quot; so , there are offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so you also jump to administration and volunteers .
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they must explain the refugees that it takes just and makes it possible to bridge the time , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who will eventually develop the feeling , he could not help in Ur@@ bach anybody , should not work and be useless , that will never be integrated . &quot;
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; but the work of deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always nothing to motiv@@ ate . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do you have fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer very clearly , &quot; what man@@ cher might call na@@ ï@@ ve . &quot; a res@@ tr@@ isi@@ ko could and would not shut them out . &quot;
&quot; however , the hel@@ pers are already sensitive . &quot;
these incidents were also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely in dis@@ call .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would love to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , main - and volunteers must be on site and in the region to activities . &quot;
they always have in the background that soon a new shock could come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; clearly , this question is clear to answer the policy . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to place it hel@@ pers on the spot . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not yet arrived , where we would like to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ bacher is even busy to integrate the previous people .
&quot; currently , these are about 100 people , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them both women . &quot;
the political world situation is so complicated because there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : ri@@ bre@@ cher with helicop@@ ters sought
the police helicopter flew about one hour long different areas - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are steep@@ ed on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 o &apos;clock in an apartment in an apartment house in the l@@ den@@ weg .

&quot; at the beginning , the police set several strings as well as a police helicopter . &quot;
the flag@@ ging ran without success .
perhaps the unknown before the apartment or at their escape .
