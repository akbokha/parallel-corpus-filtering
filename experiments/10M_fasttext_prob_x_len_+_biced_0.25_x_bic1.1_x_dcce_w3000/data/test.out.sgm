<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a bit with a few colleagues with a ride on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "Golden Sportpyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses reminded themselves of their celebrations, they jumped in fast gallop to the forage."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a kilometer at this pace, I am afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And this ended the riding career then again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany was best golfers of all times - 101 tournament wins - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">"he allowed himself to carry out his family about the facility of ALRV, on a horse, he didn't have a photograph for himself for photo purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">The first time in Aachen and therefore also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German Sporthilfe passed the man from Anhausen in a small gala into the Golden Sportpyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">On awards it lacks the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundesfinanciz, silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour of the Year..."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton and tracumps in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the trade deal at TTP - we want both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential elections are however on the tax and energy policy as well as in a base question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a principled, more philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"trump wants to keep a small size in doubt and warns that, as the state of economy can harm, with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to raise the economy to death and regulate death he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">"on the other hand, he would be quite different, claiming a trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively return the regulations, and it makes for a wide-ranging tax reform with lower tax practices - for individuals and for businesses."</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton said to him: the state has certain tasks to fulfill he has disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, the taxes would be increased to the rich, it says."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton almost wore."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic Applicin announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">"state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies, and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teapy wing of the republicans."</seg>
<seg id="16">"so on Trump, you could also send a party internal discussion."</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are clearer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-power plants and drive up the coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production is to be possible also in so far protected areas, the Paris climate agreement wants to announce."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly strengthen the renewable energies with their investment programme:" a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be China, Germany or America - I want we are."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazifish trade agreements, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both the US do not want to isolate the U.S. from international trade - but just want to better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">The should then also be better paid for around Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wants to increase it on 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump will do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to go, then he says he should not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump is standing, which aims to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics hold on to him, so that the budget deficit would be even greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand Clinton is, who wants to ask at least from the rich that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="2">"sexual violence is one of women who fled alone, almost in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen there are four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each baby has a baby that is at most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He will be curious with big eyes curious in the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother wins on the table top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until they noticed that it is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">They smile short and kissing the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it is the management guide of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria, and is concerned with the subject of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen were found.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in Munich's north in one of the few decentrated accommodations for single women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs took place together with Pro Familia and the Munich's Women's Aid relief.</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - even not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a waist in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has done on her escape experiences with sexual violence," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee for wars because they are prosecuted politically, because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them as hopelessness to Europe", "she tells."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women they weigh other reasons for the escape:" many steal secretly, because they see no other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home country they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honorary, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This is driving them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run it goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs demand for example for a bottle of water a sexual act, is not uncommon," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone; they are not being protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end, as soon as they are ankering in Germany, tells us danger."</seg>
<seg id="31">"even here, all the women in refugees would often be considered inferior and worse."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to that about 90 percent of women staying in the north of Munich city, traumatised them."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not optional."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too great."</seg>
<seg id="36">"as they often do not help to help, more accommodations need more accommodations for them, call for danger."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven District governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"the question whether or not they knew by a similar project like in Munich, in their jurisdiction, answer some with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, there is something like the governments of the governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"also in Schwaben are not separated alone, Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesperson of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Oberbayern, Lower and Mittelfranken, there are some common shelters or houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Niederbayern, there are two main accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">Also the committee "rights of women and gender equality" in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study that has been published for the Committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are separated. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if there is a lack of privacy or for men and women, men and women can come together, it can be - constant violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"mainly the washrooms should be separated and readily available for women, stands in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women of this protection can be felt, it is possible to read through the Andote, which there is in the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since she has been around for us that there is us, we have a long queue," "says Bahr."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of exterior"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">Leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and proclaim an official end of the eight month long lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart at the St. Petersburg's palace in reception, I cannot defend oneself of the expression that Ankara wants to end this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smiles had a little bit of heat, even for its reversed circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke about his" dear friend "" Putin - according to a report all the five times. "</seg>
<seg id="8">I could no longer count.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis, but will even be improved."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day a newspaper described that Erdogan would have heard that, than would never make something worse."</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed to indicate rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cooling showed that the President of Russia had not forgotten anything."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his quotes: the depreciation of a Russian struggle aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the period was wutated.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Putin shared and accused Ankara, Russia in the back."</seg>
<seg id="16">Passing was even bigger since it was committed by a alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Freezing rebuild becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media led a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at one time it seemed like the Turks, for all the guilt."</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious, the accusations of leading officials killed that Erdogan would have benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg, the official message that it was time to look ahead."</seg>
<seg id="24">"after all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology of President Erdogan, who he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the benefits of a cease-fire clearly lie on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends who he can get after the last month with a failed coup d'etched almost his wheel.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban of charter flights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, travel insurance and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">You count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week projected the state television, cheaper with fruit and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti imagined it:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West as it was the response to the tried to take power of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to do so, the continued Groll over the snowfall of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike is to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, Russian leader won a bonus in Ankara that he called for the tried coup d support for the elected government organs."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is well-evident for Moscow, a matter of course, which itself has a deeper fear of regimechanges."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this glorious palace at the sea made possible Russia and Turkey, one, as it was once an analyst, described," alliance of external side ": two countries who are rejected and poorly treated by the West and now."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, in spite of public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently got the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sites."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both Presidents were told at the press conference, that they could not even grasp the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey dismised it on a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open enmity, and in view of the potential for a complete disaster, as NATO member Turkey abolished the Russian martial arts - it is certainly better that the two heads of state will at least talk to one another."</seg>

<seg id="8">"1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he made his degree at the prestigious international Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the website of the Kremlin, it is said (in Russian), that he later was the chief manager and Chief of Governors of the Governors."</seg>
<seg id="10">"about his appointment he said to Putin," thank you for your trust. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as President Prime Minister for the law, and checks for the implementation of your instructions."</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivanov has asked that Ivanov has asked to leave his post and called Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has turned Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest conspirators Vladimir Putin's and works like he for the Soviet secret service to the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the leader of his own request came back."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smiles for the cameras, here are few of them - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">This is what nobody knows at present.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official claim - that a man, who was once appointed as a potentially president, would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - thrust into great scepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks on Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said" It is true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation, to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - complained posts four years. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"before, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin's former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), the KGB was established, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted."</seg>
<seg id="29">"it was once believed that Ivanov could become President of Russia, as a third presidential term coup against the Constitution would have been violated."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, close ally Putin Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became the President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="4">"the SPD suggests a" "scope of life" "to the next meeting."</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">"first and foremost, it is about the question: who is supposed to build the cheap apartments?"</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"SPD spokesperson Christoph Bratmann believes:" "we agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas must continue to show 20 percent of all the apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be found in the stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but the great defense point in the Town Hall is, however, such as Bratmann:" how do you talk to investors, who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build such a minimum of 10 percent, but as possible 20 percent of the apartments are building as social housing."</seg>

<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the specialists.</seg>
<seg id="20">"yet the program is not entirely different: for the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">How do you compare the loss of further approximately 1300-priced apartments which will run for the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, the planing policies of Nicole Palm, should now be bought from the city."</seg>

<seg id="27">"for in the west city, the end of the year will run."</seg>
<seg id="28">"approximately 1800 apartments, one could get back to the price delivery for cheap apartments."</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: this does not want the owners, the housing companies."</seg>

<seg id="2">A british travel underwent his immune system and worshipeflex of a serious test - by doing some of the dirty and ekhourest places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel gate Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk hatched his course on a Euro shrine, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a washing button of a train toilette as well as a public phone in Russia to prove the immune system of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before the leak of every object, he used a liuminometer to show itself and to show us what he will get involved."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was under the title" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", "brought some surprising results."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought to throw the dishknob of a train toilette, which has already been used by thousands of others, may seem entirely repulsive, but in fact they are in a kitchen rinse more bad bacteria."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he speckled, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright has been known to test the resilience of its Darms by travelling through the world and ate peculiar, as well as wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to train stations up to dishwashers of toilets, the task set his immune system definitely under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"he told him:" already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was sure to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the only thing he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial line showed a Luminometers of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the Luminometers are fresh and less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to deny, after their Luminometer over 4000 units was, while freshly washed hands one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel agent" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial levels in different places such as the bathroom "</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," This is the worst thing I have packed in a toilet, near. "</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing beats than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm going to socks here nothing because it is here indoors.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company flocked Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to offer the consumer really something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"we led crazy brainstormings by doing so that we said," Lass us Ian. "</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about products, we wanted to put it into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the direction of the film, added:" let me say it: "" let me have lost my respect for Ian, if he would like to see some of the things I have relied on it, as the ekelous Russian toilet that is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to empty them and others where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">"I am glad, that we recorded some of these dirty goodies to film."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio-conducted survey conducted in 2015, 84 per cent of all respondents received military-bacterial bacteria in particular with the wellbeing of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products that include both mille-bacterial bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination panels: who does not buy record records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you share the commentary box, to oversewn him under the pseudonym of non-aging men with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the specifics of sound plates is not attributable to a boom in millennials, which would like to welcome the new ones of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all foresight after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobbyists - it has an emotional meaning: older plate fares retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on television, I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy road in Soho, a modest gray suit and wild strid, before I steer my hands and tell something certain of the saying," "so, let us take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let's take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Sohos is slowly entering its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were located, there are still a handful of fantastic records."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera to the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and minds."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, the I of Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle aged), a woman, presumably around the 20), is one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already treasures," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 boards."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this record, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed him home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records, which he could not afford, when they appeared and bought again items that he sold, when he was young and pleite."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 1960s, early 70ies who appeared, when I was 11 or 12. things that I probably was something too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records, rather introverted and like to spend alone time, and adds:" I don't smoke and I drink not much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my disaster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers that he meets on the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback and set themselves to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have led, people usually get emptied to their collection in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs now to buy their records," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offers a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEB, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record-fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar soundplattens, from objects, the blissful jeopies alert."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says WEZ. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case for me as a collector and I think it is the case with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" flutes a staff of a record pile.</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people purchased last month, they have not yet heard."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% have a record player which they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this point in the news report, I would probably look very concerned while I strove through a pile of bossa Nova Kompilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle aged), has noticed a" trophy "of the Revivals."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came only recently here and said," "I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead record, so I can put them into the shelf," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"readjuy, less musician."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," I have no record player. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones who come only slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"stopover, that has dedicated the record almost a whole floor, has a bundered crowd when I go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenager and women middle-age."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-standing shops - Wild Beasts New Synthesizers and sexbepacker Pop instead of experimental, from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity in the customer."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks very ugly, but nave mental traumas are hard to detectable when you stand next to someone 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs around the shop for a few minutes and looks at the varietess of the standing plates for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more of a showcase than a big purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, so the collecting of plates is not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or another way but the beauty of plates is... it drives along with a loved sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a shop, told by that a new generation of record-lovers is supposed to have inspired: urban Outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the impression that Jeans Hotellum, I watched a group of young teenager, formed for a moment to buy Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a Crosley turntables."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one sees her to - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record-art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these objects might mean more money for the industry, and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"there is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research shows that the results of YouGov vote, they leave at least in record business in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record company who exist in reality, record business and in Onlineforen."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"you will not spend their Thursday morning with certainty through record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while at the staring view of an uncanny, 30-year-old moderator, which rises over the shoulders of the middle aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court has rejected a proposal from the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in a trial period this week, the authorities argue in Calais that the state should be authorized to sell 72 provisionaries, sell hair services or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Calais prefecture, arguing that these places should be crushed because they would represent a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and sanity."</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important, as the free meals offered by the state supported and other groups were not enough to provide enough food for the growing numbers in stock."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also led out that the provisional business and restaurants can often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there were no legal basis for expulsion of people who run the 72 provisioning business, but spatially that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais are absolutely comprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the judge Jean-François Molde said that the grocery stores, cafés and restaurants would play a much larger role as merely people live, live in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas of quiet meeting place between refugees and volunteers offer.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places that were threatened by the fall was the Jungle Book Kids' Café des camp, which is shared and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people have signed the petition to keep the Kids' cafe.</seg>

<seg id="2">"the impressive performance of Great Britain on the 7-er Rugby came in the finals on Thursday evening to a dead stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were beaten up with a result of 43-7 at the Dec stage here in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji divided a master class in handling, side stepping, re-back, line-run and roher strength to win gold - their first olympic waist of any color."</seg>

<seg id="6">But independently of that Fiji would have put a 15-man team in constancy in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it is probably not - that at least a Brite morning a gold medal at his neck will hang around his neck: fijis Chief trainer Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon. "</seg>

<seg id="14">"with just four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner that he turned."</seg>

<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressed by further weak Treadings of the GB team and rushed to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the rest.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still growing."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB resulted in fundamental changes to the semi-time period and closed the fijib gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the circumstances of the first half-time, until Joshua went through a brilliant interplay of Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton started a trial for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was running long in favor of South-sesulans whose fans sutches, flags and danced on the bleachers."</seg>

<seg id="4">"even though it was only those who were sitting at the Ruder, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was omnipresent as she used to the second olympagold in two without tax lady, the first women in the history of British sports that put on such a scale."</seg>

<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant Athletins, which glide on the surface with the elegance of sponge, which is not the way of the triumph of it."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind every gold in the roders there is a battalion of wilful helpers, who make the difference and it was no man-more than the coach, who would not survive this day at all, when it was diagnosed with cancer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he was risky."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, the operable one and they did it."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not do it, it spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather horrible situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, could start out what the break was on a minimum in case that under such circumstances is the correct term."</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money so I had to go back soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and ran at the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rowing in itself is already a challenge, but this makes it even greater."</seg>

<seg id="22">"it is only repeated how much I have worked, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked."</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best coach of the world."</seg>
<seg id="25">I could not have wished for a better person for wearing or better trainers.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning has no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even at the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark have concluded, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very in the moment trapped.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" "abiding in the process, abiding in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to not get started.</seg>
<seg id="32">"we had a good start and at the same time, we were not looking out to make something great."</seg>
<seg id="33">"today we did not want fireworks, we just wanted to achieve a good result, going out and win the race what we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a time for one year before making decisions about his future.</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, Spirit, Health: singing seniors good</seg>
<seg id="2">"the Singen has accompanied URSEL Kipp for her whole life: as a young girl she studied the Fach music, and today she sings the 78-year-old in a senior choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"sing me - emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, they feel balanced, cheerful and overall lively, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"right now, she is doing something good for her health and her mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"because Singen is the same from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in chorus and share with like-minded people, the joy of the music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular interacting seniors social contacts can take up and maintain.</seg>
<seg id="9">"because often, social and family structures in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made URSEL Kipp in their choir: to speak and organize themselves on the others - a choir is a very special form of being together.</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">Because they are practicing a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">"who calls on his lungs regularly, also in everyday life are not as fast as the Puste."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even though it is about getting the sound of the voice at the age, Singen is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in elderly people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association for seniors."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure time."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz frequently observed that the singing or hearing of songs with older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through lyrics and especially melodies, himself denied the sick people suffering from long backward events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head is also demanded for a special achievement, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time concentrate on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - that's a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">"especially older people living alone, practice not only on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through the singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem is growing by the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show themselves: if I am for a long time, I will be better and waken beyond me - this experience reinforces."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start with singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he means having little talent, betrays Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you do not sing alone - with 50 singing people, who sounds there, when a sound goes beside it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the right offer seniors various possibilities - says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">"sings someone from the acquaintances in a seniors, one can easily join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who like to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church council.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can also find many seniors in the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"who has no access to the internet, family, friends or neighbours can ask for help with the internetreche."</seg>
<seg id="35">"who like to sing, should join in a choir, betraying Hackler."</seg>

<seg id="9">"although there is no direct references to that government tips given under Obama's instructions, the reports shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their prunlaws, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements prior to Congress were clearly positive than it corresponds to the facts."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom Anders announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls can already start in April or May 2015."</seg>

<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations into CentCom reports are underway by the General Secretary of Defense Department."</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the intelligence service have published their own findings on Thursday with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>

<seg id="20">"this process, so Mr. ship," delayed the publication of retrospect reports, "said the morals under analysts and" gave overly little space for smoother opinions. "</seg>

<seg id="5">I do not belong to the people who keep their gates in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, that knows them: the American players are at 4-0 in the olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britons on the first place, which remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan."</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday last round of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which the two will reach the first and second place within their group."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first-placed man will take a little longer out of the road that lead the other group to the other.</seg>
<seg id="10">"like the game on Saturday, the Americans have sparked a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they landed in the last London games on the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey club in their hands (her two older sisters played the sport on the Drexel University), with 16 years she became the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">"she missed the Olympiad in 2008, since they could not qualify for the cadres."</seg>

<seg id="17">"we did not have the work place in London, which we now have."</seg>
<seg id="18">We can be able to tear the rod completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday morning Bat the Torreigen opened up in the first half of the game with a setback from the searea.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone out in the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprising and kept the game level from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she carried a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and lute the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 guide."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the keepers of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who so far had to book a gate in any of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Exactly like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," Parnham, but how well will we depend on Saturday the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the middle of the Rage of Olympic Games, the Zen of trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly changing and inescapable, a fast run between competition and quest."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is, as if the olympic Fackel itself would be a burning stab that is handed down from wristsheers to the swimmers to the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you cannot switch off the TV to listen to a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbors in the queue, without Simone Biles, Katie Lecoy or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's swarm with dimples, could certainly have been among these known names, built up to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-empathy if he would be a swimmer, Turner or even fencer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the olympic trampoline for gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not illuminate any event equally.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partially in the shadow are the sports that are not generally recognized: airbrush shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breastswim and may it be for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I would like to do arguments for my particular lover, let me direct the attention to the discreet charme of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline has already been a Olympic event since 2000 it had been a debut album, it was the last 16 years that many people I ask, did not know that it is at all a Olympiasportart."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the US sent athletes to go to competition, it has never won a medal in a trampoline and had an athlete until 2012, which made it up to the final."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline has a certain outsider model, partly because it sounds for the unresolved ear passable for a Clownsschule as the one for the Olympic Games sound."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoonful trembling of his never to end cloudy - but also the Grazie of the gymnasium and diving, the two sports which it is essentially united."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging winner jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, heels and saltos) before they land at the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympics, they are evaluated according to the execution, degree of difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"two-one athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic Vector is straightforward.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists must continue in their quest for gold, faster, upward, and over, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes and return, upwards and down in the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they do not only chase the Ziellinie or the raw wall, but also in television transmission: the world or the Olympiad of the Olympiad."</seg>
<seg id="28">"purposeful pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a audience."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I think even when choosing these games as something tired.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of this the trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A advance movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she prallt, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes upwards, then downwards, then effortlessly back to the top."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves to the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition with the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the Streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; those of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the ends as part of a afternoon block on two days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the middle of the Olympia Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general turmoil."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the awareness of consciousness can only be achieved through the showing and the lenses of male athletes, according to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley expects his way to rinrinse, new fans."</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators to challenge political changes in Ethiopia have to call on violent resistance from the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that zig protesting while clashes were killed with the police at scissors.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to be together?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but during the last few months, protests against the government broke out the country and spread out into ever more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the response of the government was unmerciful."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave witnesses that policemen were shot in zig-armed protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"there are few videos about the protests that probably come from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people beat young people with staves, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN authority for Human Rights now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa from the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded at considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pendulum train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even though Ethiopia was anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organisations have continued continuous oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited, whereby Discount became effective for silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were put into exile, or sent to prison, or surpassed into the deserts of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the land of land to the stranglehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a long lasting election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now monitor 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a battle for these jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fear that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogades who have been more or less forced to exploit turbulence over the last few years.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the bitterness after years of age in front of Hinköchelns can now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first appears harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in the last few years many Ethiopians have been able to communicate via social media, as cheap smartphones have always been more frequent and improved the internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government lacks access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are staying."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave them to meet the protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since aeons prospered the Amharas, which come from aedication predominantly Christian highlands, in politics and business, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests found in the areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray that constitute about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, in the secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on a non-known disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was considered tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analysts say that he was particularly obsessed in it, early signs of discontent and use special officers to process opponents and make them inharmful."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the present regime lacks this basic skill," Mr. Abdi, a conflict analytic. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected from relatively unattended reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray Region of NordäEthiopian, Mr. Hailenavam comes from the South."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he does not have the confidence of the confidence of the Tigray-controlled safety services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time, that Ethiopia was experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, who were seemingly fuelled by the government according to data analysis, and subsequently stolen by the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following sweeps, many protesters were killed, even though it were less than in the last months and that time of disturbances were relatively quickly over."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts in Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new pendulum train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intensification of internal abnormality of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesting in gondar, an amharian city, of Tigray guided shops and the hatred against the Tigray is becoming more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that the protests the US and other Western allies are bringing in an independent position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring of Somalia, even though she recently voted on that she has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West doesn't want to support democracy, he does not want his ally collapsing in an already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr. Abdi," "is a very thin grass."</seg>

<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historiography.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Coes last book" Chop Suey "was about the Chinese cuisine in the USA, whereas in its book" 97 Orchard "was told in her book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"their latest cooperation," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday in Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity, as they met with a reporter in the Eisenberg's sandwich shop for dinner, a small, snaky snack at Flatiron District, which has been in business since the IPcrash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh virgin sandwich with olive trees, while Coe, 57, Truthahn with potato püree and vegetable mixture ate."</seg>

<seg id="15">"they were prepared from an ingredient and a little bit, that is the ingredient."</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine so many peanuts eating that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">Coe grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have put itself in the stomach such as lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-can-eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women cooked for male rock workers and it became freshly baked pasted for breakfast, lunch and dinner served."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Americans were imprisoned during the first World War foods on a hungry Europeans." "A Square" "paints the paths with which the country was killed, no longer to be the larlaring country."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central, tense theme," begged coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"just as tense was the new budgetary thing: mysterious dishes like breads and casserese were used to staple food, food remains re-confidently," noted Ziegelman, because chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a screaming sauce. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper drought.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of the American cuisine, became a rare in-fourth luxury."</seg>

<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland is usually only in winter to surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This Hai was allowed to go back to the sea after an examination on board the research council.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic Ocean until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland - only received with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"painted floats along the ground of the North Atlantic at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is just 1.220 metres far."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it comes to arrives, the five meters long animal accelerates to satte 2.7 km / h - and with this maximum speed half as fast as a Robine."</seg>
<seg id="9">This has a long life-shaped lifestyle but seems to be a silver bullet for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the Copenhagen University and his colleagues report in the journal" Science "at any rate from a Greenland, the 392 years old could be."</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," said Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this life-span, which means for hurricane a world record. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"though, the evolutionary biologist already pointed out that Greenland is stony old."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland is difficult to observe, after all, they mainly live in the polar sea front of the sparsely populated coastal regions of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water-temperatures around the six degrees celsius, they appear in the surface mostly only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">"about the lifestyle of Greenland, researchers know accordingly little."</seg>
<seg id="17">Her Zeitlupentempo measure her as they expelled six animals by a transmitter six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">"booty make this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remnants of a Robbe, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">"possibly they chase them sleeping animals or patrol on the ground of the icmeeres, and seek carcasses, that torches out from higher water layers to the bottom."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as a hub from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimetres measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, analysing them with the Carbon-14 method the Linsenkers of Haie."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is already born before the birth of sharks, which are contained in the proteins that are no longer renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lentier.</seg>
<seg id="25">"after the early 1960s, their birth should lie greater quantities of this radioactive carbon carbon into the atmosphere in the early 1960s."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the case of 220 centimeters in length, the third-smallest animal contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday at its investigation in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all major Greenland sharks had normal carbon-14 amounts, that arises through cosmic radiation in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-clock showed an age of 335 years long Greenland an age of 335 years, during the record-shark with 502 centimeters, even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-females only then get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign the length of an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters are probably at the brink of sex ripe, and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland with the multiplication is obviously at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">Even this might be the case for vertebrates at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland whale, whose speck at the neck was captured a 120 year old Harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, there is often the organism of the animals living there on austerity."</seg>
<seg id="36">So you mature then later - and altern slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are also often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"because volume is growing much faster than its surface, through which the animal gets heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one grams of mouse is therefore much greater than in one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous, and should concentrate on as many descendants as possible as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary anologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"however, a very big animal should invest more in a long life on the other hand."</seg>

<seg id="3">"according to a current survey of the Malware-defense specialist Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, partly several victims of an attack with blacksmith software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies already finish the target of a ransomware yield."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of victims paid by the perpetrators requested to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialise their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potentially extinguish ransom falls much higher than in private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying fast evolution of damages," explains Malwarebytes-Chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators will be discovered for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"first, private users were the goal, but the change to company attacks took place in the past months frightening."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works for a simple pattern: once upon a victim's computer, it looks for unlong changed files such as Wordcloud, Excel or database files, as well as archives and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the final turnkey code to the files, the victims must pay money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where private users use the personal photo database at stake, it is about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production tacit."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly higher the damage fails, if a ransomware fails."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected German firms generated sales losses by Ransomware, 13 per cent even had to break the business completely, in case of a case people were in danger."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany there were several hospitals victims of attacks, whose patients may be threatened by the loss of sickness."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say to the victims always: paying not, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies, who pay, get their data back."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of perpetrators compared to a standstill."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know that and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the security researcher of F-Secure took the use of F-Secure, and come into contact with the compiler and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to establish a kind of customer service in order to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"you declare their sacrifices by chat on how to pay by Bitcoin, direct support websites or decode free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and will trigger private people after payments of a few hundred Euros, companies need to be partly hard to negotiate and five-digit sums up to retrieve their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the Ransomware degradation, the hacker will always professional and share the work, the safety expert Chester Wisniewski of antivirus-provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware about within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"more likely, it is that it is about three or four persons."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evenings one gets eternal, at night you can wake up for hours, at night is already far from the wake-up and no longer think of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, these problems are in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep and more than ten per cent feel frequently or permanently restful."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes in them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weaving, a member of the German Society for Schlafes and Schlafes."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one comprehends among them, is the Insomnia, so a inhalation and sleeping disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"just the sleep many people feel as unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht, Board member of the German home medical association with practice in lower Saxon Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What lies behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleeping disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind it, organic, mental or malignant factors, but also medication are stuck."</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the disorder expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early it is above all with depression frequently," says Weaving. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that various factors appreciate each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, who has a slipped disk, can be bad, guarded every two to three hours and begin to greet you about everyday issues and care, there are Weaving an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you talk to your doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who is not well asleep over a month of one month in at least three nights per week, and in the day is impaired, should go to the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment may look quite differently: one is tired, tired, unexhausted, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has moods or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate the sleeping disorder, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"as a treatment options, among other things behavioral changes, a cognitive behavioural therapy or also drugs - classical dorms only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquestion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"even in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the interdisciplinary and Medical Center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"for this reason, one should first contact the doctor's doctor first."</seg>
<seg id="24">This may clarify with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should get into the dormitory, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"to study in the dormitory physician, medical advice, for example, in snoring with respiratory disorders, in pathological daydness, or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, explains Fixed."</seg>
<seg id="27">It really does not have to prepare for the study.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"just please do not make a nap," says Fixed. "</seg>
<seg id="30">After the cabling one goes to bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-up, a chest strap and a antennae at the finger."</seg>

<seg id="33">How can people cope with the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which one can put a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Weaving counts on: regular bed- and lifting times, not too long in bed, do not sleep too long in bed, do not watch TV to sleep, alcohol and watch at night - then you start immediately to reckon, and this is quite and not at all conducive."</seg>

<seg id="5">"article on this" trendy neighbourhood "," as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, but in the last weeks however preferred by burning cars. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents of lease, on the ground floor are still spaces occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin coursenator Henkel had spoken many times for a hard course of the police against the project, the area called" no-go-zone "for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after on 22nd June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, were cleared with 300 police officers, patched up three weeks of official statements. according to 30 to 40 officials and three teams in front of ground, blocked parts of the street and kept visitors to enter the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown homeowners the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin-Administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal, and a day later, police and builders headed by sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon, the street works peacefull: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking vory late."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main part of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer who lives in Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who runs three children here, are mostly generalized from the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the domestic projects, they share the concern before rising rents and centrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it does not sound like a pouz, which is mainly forced to take tribulations against vandalion left."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, who made the Berlin coursenator and the police between domestic and their neighbours, does not seem so manifest."</seg>

<seg id="18">Also home-occupied and the natives of them are already long in the Kiev: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including nearly the entire Mainzer street near the Rigaer. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been cleared at large police officers, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who were occupied 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the district of the last few years has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and constitutioners from all over the world: they now divide the inhabitants from GDR and former home-occupied areas."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this also applies to the rents, which has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">"many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes it in the swollen slices, or newly designed facades, which were thrown with color."</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned so often together with the words "centre-autonomous violence".</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason that not all neighbours might consider this as a problem, be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as bodily injury are based almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the most part of the crimes make harddamage, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who lived for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94, there may be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as far as violence is concerned, it is important: people in the 94 are their neighbors, which have not been determined."</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars give it right in the Rigaer no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary," "one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rigaer Straße - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"it was therefore also that it was so important that the inhabitants returned to its road: from the police, politics and the media, which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city in July."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of the inhabitants like Neugebauer, the road will continue to take away: through sighted new buildings in former buildings, which suppress the ancient inhabitants."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Regine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the eigh Wollmilchsau who has above all a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"so, some - less spotting rather than on the multitude of requirements wish to be purposeful - meant as the administration wanted to write the position."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he was looking for a administrative force with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long experience in the field of social work, even a reliant wool sau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but administration is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is going to work to work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network activity."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been with it for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent location for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle Ehr- and full-term actors are supported. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small problems, organizational, human and insuring problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are available in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem is it for some time to find apartments for connecting people who have been acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for connecting the municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must accomodate the refugees in their own or rented areas.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the cost of construction, rent or refurbishment of these accommodations must take the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility extends from the Office of the Commune at the Commune and in the JobCentre.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed for some time and very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, the management does not find private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it is not possible to rely on private apartments, so deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, we need to be in common apartments as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so, new containers will soon be placed in the washing road."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed base, there are internships, educational sites, school sites, one-euro jobs and exhilaration for refugees and migrants that need to be collected or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help house master, perform non-profit work - and this motivates and very neat as Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive outward effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is no employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not mean only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day need a solid structure, say deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People need to develop a belonging feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so, there are offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So you also jump to administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome and welcome in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they must explain the refugees that it takes just and makes it possible to bridge the time, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who will eventually develop the feeling, he could not help in Urbach anybody, should not work and be useless, that will never be integrated."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but the work of deuschle and customer is therefore always nothing to motivate."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do you have fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "says Regine customer very clearly," what mancher might call naïve. "a restrisiko could and would not shut them out."</seg>
<seg id="50">"however, the helpers are already sensitive."</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely in discall.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would love to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, main - and volunteers must be on site and in the region to activities."</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new shock could come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"clearly, this question is clear to answer the policy."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to place it helpers on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not yet arrived, where we would like to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes clear that the Urbacher is even busy to integrate the previous people.</seg>
<seg id="63">"currently, these are about 100 people, mostly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them both women."</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated because there are no simple answers.</seg>
