Obama received Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has not been very friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as by Teheran &apos;s destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; but on the meeting , it should also be concerned with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ states solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been ex@@ ited for many years .
Washington has critic@@ ised the ongoing expansion of Israel and a Netanyahu @-@ lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; due to the deal being done by Obama on the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two further deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in March , Netanyahu had held a controversial speech in front of the US Congress held in front of the US Congress held partly as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not dis@@ spoken with Obama , a meeting had to be rejected at the im@@ pending election in Israel . &quot;
in a call is Professor to shot his girlfriend
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon appeared with a somewhat c@@ itt@@ y voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s significant to emphas@@ ise that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said , the family @-@ contacts of dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house , officials found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a handmade note that was attached on a white block : &quot; I wanted to go , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter and he was already signed . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that represented in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland , Mississippi , has already travelled 300 miles to school grounds where he has shot a popular history professor , eth@@ ane Schmidt , at the door to his office and killed . &quot;
Delta State University Political advoc@@ ated Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff members have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he had made the fatal emergency call after it .
&quot; by the end of the day there was another death , and a lamb took life when the police officers . &quot;
&quot; one day after the shooting at the University , the students and teachers were forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what &apos;s motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details , which were published by the investig@@ ators in both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers . &quot;
students said that they were happy about their lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ st died , said , He has no history of violence or a criminal record . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself acted in a book written by him , in whom he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both representatives in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose members consist of 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some in@@ clin@@ ations about problematic behavior .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , leader pra@@ ising God , said he seemed a bit of upset and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb has told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; he had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons , and said that he had any health problem either . &quot;
this year he arranged only two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in employment policy of the university was significant that the promotion , which represented so hard for him , would be no guarantee for an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant @-@ Professor . &quot;
&quot; dear President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he ignor@@ es nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs presentation . &quot;
these are questions that &apos;s no longer able to answer .
after the flight from the campus the police found later Lam@@ b@@ da Track when he returned to Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as .
&quot; before he could be arrested , he escaped with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &quot; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb was coming to this house , but Johnson said that she knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 he began his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a town with around 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
he was a mo@@ at in the spring of education .
&quot; one of the many years of friendship Lam@@ bs described it as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Carla H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through joint friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach the guitar game for several years . &quot;
back then he was the women &apos;s s@@ warm .
&quot; all girls melting away if he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency , &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife &quot; , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that is adjacent to a bath in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; ex @-@ husband from Pr@@ enti@@ ss , sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said they were divor@@ ced back 15 years ago , but friends have stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; it was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
they and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he never met him , but his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that he was interested in music and playing blues . &quot;
represented pre@@ inde@@ er when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared both for three years ago both for a summer period .
later they played together one or the other gig .
&quot; o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter wrote and sings her own music . &quot;
pre@@ occupation was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes entertainment Co@@ ordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he &apos;s marked and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5th September after finishing his guitar and harmon@@ ic harmon@@ ic ended before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the elevator and sh@@ un@@ ted together .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense for jo@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester training program and specialised in American natives and colonial history , Don All@@ an Mitchell , a English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and of the student &apos;s Committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland took some 900 people on Tuesday evening , including performances , employees , students and members of the community . &quot;
&quot; Schmid@@ ts woman Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt participated in the wake @-@ guard , while the universally named &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; amazing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we are trying to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io Soli@@ s worked from Cle@@ veland , Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press Rel@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this review . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected , in order to reflect the fact that the police had stopped the emergency , after being killed Schmidt and that Lamb referred to his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us is planning to set less labor for Christmas time
&quot; To@@ ys R Us says that there are not so many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products de@@ aler@@ ship says that he will be giving a chance to work out more hours at the moment . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it plan to set 40,000 people in shops and sales centers across the country . during the Christmas period 2014 , there were still 4@@ 5.000 workers employed . &quot;

&quot; while the holidays are still a few months away , the Christmas business is closer , and companies prepare to set time @-@ workers to equi@@ p stores with employees that sell , ship and produce products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox jo@@ king on his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat beside me is empty , and it will gradually become clear to me that Princess Diana is next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to me in my mind that I am feeling a simul@@ ated fer@@ rous and a b@@ m@@ n of it , with the princess of Wales on a Date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; A documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ ah Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;

UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Mr. K@@ i @-@ moon says , his response to Russia &apos;s military support for Syria is , &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years lasting conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN boss calls for once again all parties , including the European Security Council , to unite and to support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; said a press conference on Wednesday that he is planning to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - US , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the General Assembly session in this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ ts that the spl@@ its within the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; will make this situation in@@ sol@@ vable .
&quot; B@@ an urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria to cope with the crisis in Syria , having demonstrated it with Iran in achieving a nuclear issue . &quot;
8 sub@@ survey levels that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop brand .
others have abol@@ ished him as a joke .
some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Re@@ public@@ ans try , Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks at surveys down , it has ( still ) did not work . &quot;
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range and some begin to ask themselves seriously what it means to the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course it is too early in the election period .
nobody says that Tr@@ ump will likely win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphas@@ ise that too that time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership was released to the rising Herman C@@ ain , none of them only won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have in a general election .
&quot; but outside groups , like Je@@ b Bus@@ hes Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth recognize now traps and begin to let their dollars flow towards it . &quot;
here are some current transformations related to the fact that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
m@@ umps Pop@@ ulation levels have turned around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in the middle of June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Re@@ public@@ ans considered the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l . &quot;
by the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
about three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures remain in early states .
&quot; a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac set in Iowa has determined last week , that 60 percent of Re@@ public@@ ans have a good view of tr@@ ump . &quot;
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as a candidate .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c last week 67 percent of Re@@ public@@ ans , they would be either &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; if tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two out of 10 say they would &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son will say about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say , they were &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent , which will say the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next in things enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they are &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if everyone was Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Re@@ public@@ ans sees considerably temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for its bom@@ bas@@ tic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the members of the Irish Re@@ public@@ ans believe that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l have the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC news / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number applies in the first state of the nation , the State of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans think he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to perform effectively his ministry , and nearly six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his tem@@ per was not in the White House , so ABC / post . &quot;
re@@ public@@ ans get used to the idea .
&quot; if they put their nests , we hold Republi@@ can voters Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P @-@ nom@@ ination after a survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c from last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump will be the best bet . &quot;
&quot; that is a change from the date , when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on Je@@ b Bush . &quot;
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not get the clear@@ est cryst@@ all@@ ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle four of ten Re@@ public@@ ans had thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination just 28 % for the final Candi@@ t Rom@@ ney .
&quot; nevertheless , it shows that a large number of GO@@ P @-@ voters are seen as plau@@ si@@ bly . &quot;
&quot; even if the re@@ public@@ ans have gathered for another candidate , Tr@@ ump is preparing for almost everybody . &quot;
some experts suggest that the chi@@ pped field is likely to contribute to trac@@ ts guidance while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ Support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ at @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump harvested the cri@@ tically support . &quot;
&quot; he recently decided ahead of C@@ arly Fior@@ ina 13 points , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Kast@@ e and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ at @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneurs with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ head over@@ head .
a scarce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says that they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters are willing to support , say that they have already awarded their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change this and no one can truly say , never mind change . &quot;
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ umps is strongest competition in the moment the other out@@ si@@ ders , neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as frequent for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say , they are consistent with tr@@ ump in immigration . &quot;
&quot; since then , Donald Tr@@ ump got caught in his election campaign two months ago from Mexico &quot; rape , &quot; was the immigration turn@@ around and ful@@ crum in public discourse to 2016 . &quot;
some are ap@@ prehen@@ sive that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expres@@ siveness of Tr@@ ump will hold decisive Hisp@@ ano @-@ Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and to damage the re@@ organization efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / post event of Monday , six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans are stating that they are in agreement with tr@@ ump for questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; thus , as long as the immigration in the spotlight will remain , Donald Tr@@ ump will seem to do it too . &quot;
the frustration of the government clim@@ bs to new high@@ s .
&quot; now , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son falls in the meantime about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly through their out@@ sider status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry with Washington .
&quot; a survey of D@@ es Mo@@ ines reg@@ isters / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of four Iowa Re@@ public@@ ans are frustrated by the re@@ public@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; polite . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive locations in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ bi@@ ken@@ weg path there is the most expensive home system - with a view over the Nord@@ se@@ e@@ watt .
&quot; in the street , a square meter square meter costs an average of 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects naturally is limited - therefore it says in the study , therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which particular layers are the most cost of one square meter .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s Top @-@ Where is , one of the price is defined as Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
real estate service providers &amp; Völk@@ l has published a list of exclusive German residential locations - with square footage in di@@ zz@@ ling heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euros - per square meters , well @-@ noted . &quot;
but good who can afford it ...
&quot; by the way , Munich is here an exception not at the top . &quot;
Champions League : Bayern @-@ Traum@@ t@@ start thanks to Müller and Go@@ al
doubt go@@ al@@ sc@@ orer in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has simply a run .
a happy hits by Thomas Müller on FC Bayern will pave the way to a con@@ den@@ sed 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus - then ran it .
a sovereign opening of the Champions League season .
&quot; the World Champions Thomas Müller and Mario Go@@ tz@@ e have followed the FC Bayern at the Hex@@ en@@ kes@@ sel of Piraeus a dream start to the &quot; mission Milan . &quot; &quot;
the crew of Trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola has won her debut in the Champions League at the Greek record athle@@ te in the hottest atmosphere thanks to the Mü@@ llers Double @-@ Double Challenge ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th ) and i@@ dol @-@ places ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth starter project in Serie is to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally take the third install@@ ment at the hen pot@@ t after Munich .
Müller received his 28th results in the Champions League on the tour @-@ based mi@@ xes of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ alie Roberto , who &apos;s going to pass a f@@ lange of the world &apos;s master . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m was promised before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ akis stadium &quot; &quot; at 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the estu@@ aries held . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shine .
&quot; Piraeus had won his latest six home games in the top class , among them against well @-@ known monasteries like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; however , the Bayern , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
they were courageous with their open efforts but often to mon@@ einf@@ all@@ ly to works .
the attacks were often introduced by the attack on Link@@ ed@@ ton Douglas Costa who rarely came through the former Braunschweig by Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had luck from the right side of the left when his flan@@ k cras@@ hed out of the right half @-@ seat in the upper left corner .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
&quot; first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms W@@ ye Brown made the head ball of the Pole from the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct dial , the go@@ alie Roberto with the knee ( 3@@ 5th ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bavaria has used her usual play , she could use pir@@ able needle . &quot;
on door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel Neu@@ er was but Lost .
so approximately when he ad@@ ored a shot from ide@@ ye to the rat ( 5@@ 6th ) .
&quot; before he left Gu@@ ardi@@ ola a quadru@@ ple chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre of Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it fine . &quot;
&quot; Mario Go@@ tz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cabin , sat first out . &quot;
&quot; the World Championship has just given the final light after the examination , he said Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , this is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also at the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he had King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an for the deserted Le@@ aders ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ tz@@ e arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later everything clearly , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller still a dr@@ on . &quot;
in front of the game the stadium had come to Kra@@ w@@ alle .
&quot; after a smaller group of some hoo@@ ded Bayern @-@ fans in their viewers @-@ block seems to have prov@@ oked the supporters of host Pi@@ re@@ aus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went with stro@@ kes against the Munich &apos;s followers . &quot;
at least one Bavaria @-@ fan was injured from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk , to lose teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , and thus not only the lungs , but also the teeth - this places a Potsdam @-@ long @-@ term study . &quot;
good news : with notice the risk is fast approaching .
smokers have a significantly higher risk to lose their teeth early .
&quot; this is derived from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smokers was the risk of losing their teeth prematurely to lose the 2,@@ 5@@ - up to 3,@@ 6 times higher . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
&quot; primary causes for tooth failure are c@@ aries and inflammation of the g@@ um line , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and dental loss is therefore going back at frequent gin@@ gi@@ g@@ ums with smokers .
not to be clarified to what extent smoking is also increased the risk for tooth decay .
&quot; men who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it could however last more than ten years , until the endanger@@ ment again to the level of non @-@ smokers , S@@ du@@ g said Mr. Diet@@ rich from the English university of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; it must be convinced of people to become non @-@ smokers , stated &quot; &quot; manager H@@ ein Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot;
&quot; not too smoking is good for lungs and vessels , and according to our knowledge also leads to a good dental health to the high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , more than 20 percent of people aged 65 to 74 years have been affected by dental medicine , DI@@ f@@ E shared . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking is the risk of early tooth failure .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ p@@ inn@@ ed the findings .
archae@@ ologists come across Köl@@ ner Rhein@@ u@@ fer on Res@@ te from the Sp@@ ät@@ tis
&quot; for the repeated time , at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne , there were some arche@@ ological discoveries . &quot;
&quot; near the building site for the new Rhein@@ boulevard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ isches Museum Skel@@ ette and Res@@ et historic buildings were excav@@ ated , museum manager Marcus Tri@@ er on Tuesday . &quot;
since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine is a historian on the search for so @-@ called ground monuments .
&quot; for all construction projects in the Stadt@@ district , Cologne , the museum is always being involved as a Institute for Archae@@ ological Con@@ monuments . &quot;
in the third section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards the archae@@ ologists became manifest .
&quot; some text documents have already been known , that in the 4th century a fortress was established and in the 8th century , a church explained , explained Tri@@ er . &quot;
&quot; along with lef@@ to@@ vers of the fortress and the cherry tree , a cemetery with around 350 tombs had been discovered , who probably belonged to the church . &quot;

EU Commission fails to fight a new court in dispute
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the tough@@ ness of the dispute over the planned transatlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a large reform of the current arbitration system . &quot;
the controversial private arbitration facilities for disputes between corporations and countries should therefore be replaced by a transparent system that significantly matches more traditional dishes in its operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to establish a system which trust citizens &quot; , &quot; declared European Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot;
the Swedish has presented the proposal as a European parliamentary negotiating position in the US &apos;s free @-@ trade talks .
the German government announced support .
TTIP must rise to the world &apos;s largest free @-@ trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; on the reform of the current arbitration proceedings , the plans for the reform of the current arbitration proceeding strongly suggest that the EU and the US select together independent judges for a new investment country . &quot;
&quot; they are expected to come from the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot;
for the first time a second instance is scheduled .

&quot; up to now , the procedures of the processes involved among the refer@@ ee , an objection to the judg@@ ments were not there . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past months , it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fairness and justice . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it is intent on working on an international investment tribunal in the long term . &quot;
&quot; there , an example between Chinese companies and EU states could also be clarified there . &quot;
the investor state @-@ state arbitration proceeding most of all - considered one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbitr@@ al tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ b , the companies receive damage from tax@@ payers , national laws , or a lowering of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations like Camp@@ act referred to proposals by the European Commission as inadequate . &quot;
it has been critic@@ ised for the trade agreement negotiated by Canada ( CE@@ TA ) for the already tra@@ ded free trade agreement ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic secretary of Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) declared plans on the other hand as great progress .
&quot; the Commission considered essential points for the reform , which claimed the Federal Minister of Commerce Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbitration should be taken by the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
&quot; the European corporation B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned , the pi@@ anos of the economy through too many new rules . &quot;
&quot; particularly small and medium enterprises could be disadvantaged , it was called . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on TTIP TTIP ( Transatlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) , the negotiations will continue on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been underway since mid 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US until this time . &quot;
originally a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year .
this date is regarded as un@@ sustainable .
&quot; deli@@ k@@ ater Folk , from Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg &quot;
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is sitting on the stage at the Köl@@ ner Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
&quot; next to it there is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy Fol@@ der @-@ singer has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with filtration . &quot;
&quot; the whole crowd , about 40 people , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens presentation . &quot;
&quot; he tells on the basis of various places , which he always records on the map which report about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ously and delicate songs . &quot;
where they were created and how it looks there in his homeland .
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderfully creative minister . &quot;
&quot; with 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , &quot; smart composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously very close to American Folk in the late 1960s , yet dri@@ fting any time into great opul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; it arises about the rum@@ or , &quot; Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a ru@@ gged series : each of the 50 US @-@ states should be cur@@ ated in a row . &quot;
but in 2004 and in Rhein@@ gau already &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; appeared and has a positive effect on expectations .
&quot; reduced , St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here . &quot;
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later the musicians live back to the show in New @-@ York .
&quot; T@@ aze@@ well , Illinois &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ t &quot; ) appears in 2005 as a nationwide sophisticated masterpiece . &quot;
super@@ ord@@ an on ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album rises into the US Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in an annual world @-@ based music system .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens is based on &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) with extensive electronic pieces . &quot;
&quot; this sixth studio album is still widely orchestr@@ ated , but carried by program@@ m@@ ated sequences or Be@@ ats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall . &quot;
&quot; out of the smaller clubs , the stage shows here become the colourful spectacle from Ne@@ on @-@ forehead @-@ bands and large fluor@@ es@@ sion@@ er stage de@@ ko . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring as part of a five @-@ strong band through Germany .
in the dark held on the Hamburg More !
&quot; theater presents mainly this since March &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Lo@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; although here now nearly 2000 guests b@@ ished in their chairs , the significantly irrit@@ ated St@@ ev@@ ens returns to intimacy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without putting a word to the audience , the group is excell@@ ently enriched by the broad @-@ enriched album . &quot;
&quot; you hear from the audience : the talk is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and one could throw the &quot; &quot; plate basically . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ ate at the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns debut in the prime minister of Prime Minister with tension &quot;
the new Labour leader Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ hav@@ n will let his debut in the Prime Minister &apos;s question and look for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to lunch the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch and its performance is probably checked by the media and the UK dep@@ u@@ ties .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip several sessions to leave their pe@@ ers .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ &apos;s leadership , as it comes after being appointed a member of the shadow of the shadow and after his speech at TU@@ C &apos;s Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the decision of the Labour Party , on Tuesday during the Sin@@ im of the National An@@ them , has prov@@ oked a memorial to the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , and is at the center of several Tit@@ o @-@ stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ l &apos;s decision to not sing the national an@@ them has drawn attention
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ hav@@ n said he had &quot; been in dis@@ respectful silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle for England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ hav@@ n shadow , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour president to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his faith that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shade @-@ ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ l &apos;s top team , and they refer to differences in the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party was originally supported by the leaders . &quot;
&quot; the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acking within Labour &quot; , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of threads . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour has put forward a change to remove the whole idea of a limit .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of Labour and pensions Minister that the party &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; is that it is only opposed to government plans to lower the limit of 26,@@ 000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader who made David Cameron that he has been a T@@ ory manager in parliament last decade .
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised a different policy approach , says he said &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 impulses . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said , that the leader of the Prime Minister of the prime minister , is , and that he will refrain from &quot; &quot; stroke &quot; &quot; and the quar@@ es with stri@@ kers and instead it has been made to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle is being represented in the shadows of economic secretary to him if he is not participating - for example if Mr Cameron is on his way .
&quot; he has also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally pointed out the word and that he John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House , addressed to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became the leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron told him that he is linked to politics in the style of a &quot; cas@@ u@@ le theatre , &quot; which is often associated with the leader of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he de@@ parts that he failed in it . &quot;
&quot; sent on television first in 1990 , the question was regarded with the Prime Minister as a most important bar@@ ometer for a leader and leader in the House of Commons and his position under his parliamentary state , although critics have been argued , they have become a caricature and cautious reforms . &quot;

pound increases with accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound rose @-@ nicely after data , showing an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the giving goal SA@@ BM@@ iller today . &quot;
between May and July the result grew without bonuses in the United Kingdom at 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the same period .
this percentage had been the fastest time since 2009 and was predicted by an interest rate at the time of interest .
&quot; the pound grew by more than 1 % compared with the dollar at $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was sealed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro on 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
&quot; FT@@ SE 100 Index closed an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding stock in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the acquisition of Rival AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and brands like Bud@@ den@@ gue , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were based on encouraging messages from the competition company for luxury goods A@@ chem@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
&quot; the latest sales numbers suggest all expectations , and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry , will increase growth . &quot;
&quot; out of Gl@@ en@@ core up to 5 % , after the mining industry said he received 2.5 billion USD due to stock sales as part of its strategy of debt relief . &quot;
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI have been the largest los@@ ers in index , and with a decline by 4.3 % , after gold &apos;s assessment made a rating for the company R@@ ating on &quot; sell . &quot; &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.@@ 1 % after the Sport@@ wear companies registered a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages end@@ anger the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; could mean more buying power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchase will render the higher labour costs at his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;

P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A @-@ Med@@ at brings Leban@@ on@@ ese on mas@@ king @-@ d@@ der @-@ idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
&quot; both are both - and in the potato dro@@ wning , which has developed the Ol@@ den@@ burger bar land@@ owners Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the phrase &quot; potato &quot; of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A movement , Al@@ ha@@ y Kar@@ to@@ os and meat was put together on a sp@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster using a P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; , &quot; which he had accidentally seen on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , in its shop , a barbecue , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach &quot; , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot;
the idea has now added to the Lebanese living in Munich in the meantime .
there it has been protected according to the authority and has recently been protected as a use pattern .
&quot; that is why much flesh and how much potatoes of the sp@@ it does not want to betra@@ y everyone . &quot;
&quot; just so much : &quot; it tastes together even better , &quot; he will find . &quot;
also at its customers the culinary international understanding arrive well .
met@@ adata starts acting on the fight against Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall
met@@ adata tries to protect the Ig@@ A branches in front of an Al@@ di Br@@ ing in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ adata has launched a resource @-@ speed campaign to defend the market share of the Ig@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , strengthen met@@ adata and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarkets with local food suppliers and construct the Ig@@ A by mainstream media and marketing over the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A @-@ merchants and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice manufacturers S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , who distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ shops samples and sell @-@ owner , who sell pre @-@ cheapest tickets for the South Open Football League to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash released further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholesale distributor for food , alcohol and devices leading up to its annual Invest@@ ing strategy . &quot;
there is a lot to the game since South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 per cent of Met@@ als &apos;s Ig@@ A @-@ Lad@@ in stores and higher profits as a met@@ a Ig@@ A network in the East states .
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland , more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared with some 14 per cent in Western Australia . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts as Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di twelve months after opening its first markets will take some five percent of the food market in these two countries and take away from all existing players , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Ig@@ A @-@ retailer holds 360 million sales per year and met@@ ric € 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this prognosis rests on the assumption that Al@@ di will be in the next year 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , with a turnover of $ 500 million and 600 million in each market . &quot;
the loss in the food and food business and in the amounts to Met@@ at@@ hs high Fi@@ x@@ cost @-@ based could cost roughly 13 million dollars before interest and taxes and Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
&quot; at the same time Met@@ cash market shares in the East states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A buyers are the most frequent . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ at@@ hs Sales in the food and grocery store by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2017 , will drop 4.2 percent in 2017 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading fund managers Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , with a business meeting in Melbourne , that Met@@ adata probably will disappear within a decade . &quot;
met@@ ric refused to react publicly to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
&quot; however , it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ ric has made contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week . &quot;
&quot; IG@@ As Market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 per cent , and revenues from Met@@ el@@ hs food and grocery stores , which is about 1,@@ 200 percent , which is worth 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting their operating debt recovery at a simultaneous print on both sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler posts , however , and inv@@ ests more than 150 million $ to deliver sales prices with Col@@ ors and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths among hundreds of products every week , and to deliver Ig@@ A @-@ retailers in improving their stores by rapidly growing fresh food and to provide a better choice of private label food products . &quot;
met@@ a &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adap@@ tations and shop san@@ itation programs to El@@ an will gain and hope that the wholes@@ al@@ ers will return to a pay@@ load in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Than@@ x Kok@@ te@@ akis is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
Than@@ Di Kok@@ kin@@ akis rather deserves praise as criticism for its behavior .
Than@@ Di Kok@@ te@@ akis was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damages &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise as criticism for his / her own behaviour .
&quot; Kok@@ te@@ ar@@ akis , the younger and talented du@@ os , is known as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; prepared by the in@@ famous struggle of K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA with the Montreal Masters in the spotlight . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualifying stage in Cincinnati soon after that , Kok@@ te@@ ar@@ akis , and his opponent Ryan Harrison were separated twice by the refer@@ ee , whereby Harrison had sum@@ mon@@ ed K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os , and I should hit the child . &quot;
&quot; last seen , as he was recently seen a tennis r@@ ack@@ et , after a cr@@ amp@@ f became a potential US Open victory against Richard Gas@@ quet , was defended by Kok@@ te@@ akis of He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teenage is currently at Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth , around the second place in the Single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ finals against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I &apos;m quite empower@@ ing , is the fact that according to my opinion Than@@ zi was a bit &apos; locked into the dispute , &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has destroyed a r@@ ack@@ et as he lost because of a wre@@ ck in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has crus@@ hed a bat from Fr@@ ust , and I do Than@@ x good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe that he was treated a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very irrit@@ ated 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe he deserves to be judged by his own merits . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly promoted the decision to consider K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os in the important prec@@ urs@@ ors , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term integral part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversy surrounding the road &#91; K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; and I believe that Nick did very quickly made the climb , what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray pointed out . he desc@@ ends into the eyes of the public and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism that he gets , I consider it appropriate for appropriate and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains the border , closes the border , continues refugees back &quot;
&quot; Hungary explains the emergency , and sh@@ aded the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the firm who tried to get illeg@@ ally in the land . everything with the goal of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
chaos followed at the limit when hundreds of migrants were re@@ joined in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and called Serbian officials with indi@@ gn@@ ation .
people who have fled before violence were un@@ question@@ ably for an unknown period in a ro@@ am between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose up .
&quot; as a police helicopter about them moved , the migrants &quot; &quot; opened the border &quot; &quot; and cried al@@ insul@@ ts against Hungarian poli@@ cem@@ an . &quot;
some commented from protest food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign ministers said it is &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants would be returned from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must take hold talks with Brussels and other countries over the next few days &quot; , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence of mass @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ nations group at a deb@@ ated meeting in Brussels found no common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were Refu@@ ge@@ ted to Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month , or by the end of the year - an agreement was agreed that the EU states would receive further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes into the promotion of Brussels or its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; the Emer@@ gency shelter in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could un@@ locking roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to said , &quot; &quot; his country had to leave the construction of a thor@@ n @-@ wire to Romania along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having finished a fence on the Ser@@ b border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even j@@ ail@@ ers were reported at the competition , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
in the past few months Hungary has become a lack of war migrants from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a substantial len@@ pass and became a point of entry into the European Union .
&quot; but President Viktor Or@@ ban had ins@@ isted that most of the coming economic migrants are refugees who are seeking a better life , and are not refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws which occurred at midnight in Hungary in force , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall Za@@ uns , which allowed the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws do also place higher sti@@ ckers for condemned al@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation that emerged from the mass migration , the Hungarian Government explains the state of emergency , &quot; said Government spokes@@ persons bon@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern City of Sz@@ eged . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still disagree with the military use of the military , which is expected for next week , but journalists from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs as early as days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people when trying to cross the border , 15 others have already penetr@@ ated deeply into the country . &quot;
they come across by damage the fence and they are now in police and are accused of criminal off@@ ences in the new laws .

&quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials concluded two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon was wire with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;

election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clin@@ t lead @-@ head before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in National survey
&quot; the former US Secretary of Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to keep a double @-@ digit he@@ advantage in the democratic race at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her opposite to the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now supported the support of 47 percent of democratic voters at the previous election ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not announced yet , whether he can@@ arian for the presidential camp , receives support for 15 percent of the democratic voters of the presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the previous election , most democratic voters are saying that it is too early to say that their opinion is stated what candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clin@@ ique supporters are more enduring than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS @-@ News @-@ survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders had gained some winn@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a big lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these le@@ aps have dimin@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; your support in the men has declined significantly , and S@@ anders can only return with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ ically &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under 50 years has become ev@@ apor@@ ised , and they are now on the same level . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton has a great over@@ head with the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit storm on the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now got a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group . &quot;
half of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections were told that they would support Clinton than@@ king the party when they were nominated by the Party .
&quot; a neighbourhood would support them with some pro@@ vision@@ aries , and another 15 percent would only support them because they are a nom@@ inee . &quot;
six percent would not support them .
perhaps it is not surprising that Clin@@ t &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about it .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about one quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
&quot; while 48 per cent of the democratic voters of the pre@@ elections say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less republi@@ can voters do so with their peak @-@ candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if clinics are asked to be asked in an open question why they want them to have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it is time that a woman president is president ( 13 percent ) and that they are the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; of Clin@@ i@@ ority &apos;s supporters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned . &quot;
consent to dealing with the problems and the constitu@@ ability are also cited .
&quot; as the vice president raises the potential for the presidential office in the scale , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - even though one third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked to choose the election , who would be their second choice for the party is bi@@ ds at the head . &quot;
&quot; of Clin@@ i@@ followers say more than half , that Bi@@ den would be their second choice well ahead of us . &quot;
&quot; if Bi@@ den , not decide for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton gives a head start before S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ fifty percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate to win the election , but that number has fallen from 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; by far , bi@@ des is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ fre@@ est &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important when a candidate is more important than ever @-@ Democratic voters are calling for voters . &quot;
&quot; similarly as last month , not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate for this voters of the presidential elections is unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates achieve good results in some key characteristics of the voters of their party .
&quot; ambig@@ u@@ ities , Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den are considered honest and trustworthy and with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; in the best of the three candidates , bi@@ ds cuts down in honesty , while Clin@@ t strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not agree with him . &quot;
democratic voters of the presidential elections also generally see Clinton to S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
&quot; with all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters has no view on S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton to continue using a personal email address and one server during the term as an external secretary , most of the Democratic voters of the presidential elections are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions did not affect their opinions . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation as only about one third is satisfied .
&quot; public opinion was in March , just after the problem was coming to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no implications for their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 per cent said that their opinion of her still deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; these are mainly Republi@@ can , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trustworthy , this is still a problem for them among registered voters in total : 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of the eligible voters do not hold them for an honest and trustworthy person .
&quot; at the same time 55 percent of the elec@@ torate , are much higher than not honest and cannot be trusted . &quot;
Clinton and Tr@@ ump receive good notes at leadership .
&quot; from the six tested Candi@@ date , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush respond best to honesty . &quot;
&quot; a majority sees anything but honestly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 elec@@ torate in the previous election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son is approaching a national survey close to Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is located at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
the two candidates found half of the support of voters in the new survey and others will lose dramatically .
&quot; Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support is growing by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was carried out before Fox News debate last month to 27 % in the survey on Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son mel@@ ts in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son will arrive well in demographic groups and sur@@ ro@@ gue under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , except for c@@ arly Fior@@ ina and Ohio following John Kast@@ ner , has fallen to the Governor of Scott Walker , who fell at the deepest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; the former governor of Je@@ b Bush , the former governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ bo@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place . &quot;
the error @-@ margin at the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / Or@@ c survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son increases in the pol@@ ls - he landed at 19 % support in Re@@ public@@ ans , behind the tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey of ABC news / Washington Post also showed tr@@ ump clearly before Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view of one last week rising Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump got some ki@@ os@@ side drives for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son apologi@@ zed to ask Tr@@ umps faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump the past Saturday during a campaign appearance at Iowa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the Eastern Mediterranean has currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; if top values are measured only in the distance , for bath@@ ers there are already a trip to the Mediterranean to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in the north or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure in a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; there is no more to the ocean : at a maximum of 18 degrees the water in the north and Baltic Sea in this week , shares the German weather service ( Deutscher Wetter@@ dienst , DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , swimming temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the East it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt is coming to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College
&quot; almost two years after a student during a multi @-@ channel ritual in Po@@ kon@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , be filed against five people . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ SI @-@ P@@ SI Brotherhood , Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g , during an introductory session in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , shared the police . &quot;
&quot; said officials said that he had been bur@@ dened with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeated , while he tried to go over a frozen field on one destination . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally said about headaches , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i Delta P@@ SI Brotherhood does not call the emergency number 911 , after being impot@@ ent , and waited for an hour before they brought it to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood , to bring advice , said Poli@@ cies Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members of U@@ ten@@ si@@ lien began to hide and put the welfare of the Brotherhood basically about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ cies , Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning at his wounds . &quot;
&quot; after a aut@@ op@@ si@@ e@@ report , Den@@ g has been repeated with mu@@ ters force injury to head , torso and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 every year on the ra@@ ils , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held to account , and this step of authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the first five members of the Tribunal for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with the constitu@@ ents and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to take responsibility for the individuals involved , but if there is an organisation that - officially or un@@ officially - this has - we will also hold them accountable , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national frat@@ ernity has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases the interest rates
&quot; a tax @-@ inser@@ tion comes , and the Haus@@ se will be tra@@ ded to bonds , and the economy will forward into a recession . &quot;
this is what we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only low guidance for the procedure . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate of interest and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve on raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial investments are responding . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have so inten@@ sely stressed that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
in fact several variables perform a role .
&quot; in the end , market participants could determine that the whole excitement of a system increase could possibly be exagger@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis inevitably will be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a notification to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of the U.S. interest to normal peaks , but still at a low level to fear the se@@ is@@ mic shock , which seem to fear a lot . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here &apos;s an overview of historical trends based on how some areas of the economy might respond :
&quot; as seen from the market last month , the taking place of cut@@ ters can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; once an increase comes in , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that wealth recei@@ pts could be guaranteed 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank analysts in a newer study regarding what happened after cut@@ ters of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market is usually released in the last 35 years - about 14 per cent - on the path to cement , fairly flat in the 250 days after ( average gain of 2.4 % ) , with an average yield in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , chief system strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , in Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact of the shares will occur later in the cycle @-@ cycle and the return result begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic activity but also under@@ scores them often .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that could not previously existed and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;
&quot; remarkable is that the gross domestic product is near to the lowest score , when inser@@ ts the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , 118 Z@@ inser@@ tions since 1950 was only 4.5 percent of nominal GDP under 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3,@@ 6 percent , only a few expect this to last and expect the third quarter to exhibit UL F@@ ed only 1.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ tions during such a fragile economic setting could be risky and throw the question , &quot; &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants have taken up the whole year on a tax extension of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the session of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could be an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading is only a 25 percent increase . &quot;
&quot; in our study all carried @-@ up cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle , with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ essions very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months until now . &quot;
&quot; the firm income was also volati@@ le since the market inser@@ ts a tax @-@ increase , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than with shares if they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to switch the way in time as soon as the first increase in the cycle is carried out .
&quot; at the end of the cycle @-@ cycle , the charges are immediately falling away , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; the strateg@@ ists from Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to closer ties between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ uation of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ stin from Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting is , says Jones , that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed Strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some evidence that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest has risen , the earnings age is more fl@@ atter , credit @-@ ups have extended and the volati@@ lity is increasing - all the characteristics of the market , when the F@@ ed is growing their strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and over @-@ whole enterprises , who benefit from greater proportion of their business activities in the United States , benefit from interest rates and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debts are worse , as an increase in the dollar is making its products more expensive on the global market , as well as financing their debts . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares tend to respond very positively three months after an initial atom@@ ization , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percent@@ ages after each of the companies in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percent@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; companies with high capital ren@@ ders as well as low volati@@ lity in their shares exceeded their counterparts with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percent@@ points ) , and 3 ( percent@@ points ) . &quot;
we will be a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure shares , consumers are also able to benefit through the rising dollars . &quot;
&quot; savings could see profits with higher yields , even if experts of different opinion are , how fast it will take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM and says Assembly member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; conservative member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the transm@@ itter , because of its &quot; &quot; tran@@ script &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is no longer distingu@@ is@@ hable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also tended to the BBC Music Awards and said that they im@@ it@@ ated only The Br@@ its .
&quot; EP @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the show The Voice , and said that this is not very original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , claiming a leading parliamentary member and raises new pressure on the transm@@ itter , demonstrating that it does something which does not do the private stations . &quot;
&quot; conserv@@ atory MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC Bos@@ ses , that the public @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ ender &apos; dum@@ b &quot; and no longer be distinguished from his commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I may not use the word &quot; &quot; silly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to be Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also tended to the BBC Music Awards held last December .
the BBC Music Awards which started last year seems to be The Br@@ its only under another name .
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples at which you actually only im@@ it@@ ating what already is on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC @-@ General @-@ General pointed the accus@@ ations back and argued that BBC Radio 3 lies ahead of its commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and clarification of the public .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn differently about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
&quot; and there is a commitment to live music and music playing , that is truly un@@ matched . &quot;
&quot; and I consider the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works , I also consider it important , &quot; he said . &quot;
at the beginning of this year the BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder to get involved in the past when it did so in the past because the British are less informed of classical music .
&quot; but radio 3 was not the only element of BBC manufacturing , while hearing the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport under fire , the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins took The Voice for - the musical talent show at the BBC , which was bought by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ . &quot;
&quot; see what this program is often discussed , because it is not original and is not especially striking ? &quot;
Lord Hall ins@@ isted that the BBC 1 @-@ show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced on special BBC mode .
&quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; , &quot; if it was the next time a lot of entertainment . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or to spend money of the giving payers for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales climbed up in August on the slower and the black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobile phones to shop
experts believe that the black Friday hit the issues in November
for over a decade the virtual shopping is bo@@ oted and many of the main shopping streets of Britain have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
&quot; experts say that there are now signs that the online turnover st@@ agn@@ ate , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase over the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales st@@ agn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , that has been developing over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editors of the IM@@ RG @-@ sale of the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that the online sales were strengthened three years ago , as a buyer began to make shopping with their cell phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do it in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now it com@@ mu@@ te that , and we may experience that growth dimin@@ ishes . &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon that was imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing revenues .
&quot; experts believe that buyers have their purchases in front of this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers to turn their computers to their bar@@ gain , and several traders cras@@ hed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that black Friday , where the Bu@@ yer was fighting for bar@@ gain , buyers of it , purchases its buyers . &quot;
&quot; a survey of the British Ret@@ ail Consor@@ tium found out , that £ 5 spending is spent slightly more than 1 £ online . &quot;
&quot; for some products such as television and wash@@ ers , more than one third of the sales are now available via web @-@ shops . &quot;
at the same time more than a quarter of man buys clothing and shoes online instead of moving into the woods .
Muslims buried the in Mecca on the crane accident collision - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are supported by Muslims in the first funer@@ als in Mecca by the streets .
Saudi Arabia is putting the collapse in part of the huge Saudi bin Laden @-@ group .
&quot; the Ministry of Health stated that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 persons were injured after the crane falls off . &quot;
hundreds of Muslims gathered themselves together when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to buried the kill that were killed as a crane in Mek@@ kas Gross@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee rus@@ hed .
&quot; crowded , mostly filled in white , the way@@ side , in order to declare their respect , when the first of the dead landed their final trip to Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ isse@@ z cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession went over to the Holy Sites , where only days before a building arch fell by the ceiling of the mosque , and then on the bed . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for funeral , when the Saudi king over the building of the family bin Laden , because of the catastrophe , which also gave 3@@ 94 a injured , a san@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 persons , who were killed , as a crane through the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee Mek@@ kas , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead there was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , as the crane went down . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was at the Grand Mos@@ que with his parents at the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ ling .
&quot; Saudi officers have already confirmed that the H@@ add@@ sch came to Mecca with thousands , which will continue to reach the city . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man , the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group would not have taken the arm of the crane as it was not used . &quot;
an Arabic version of the ca@@ che that was published by the State of Saudi Arabia Agency said that the Bin @-@ Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
&quot; the English @-@ language service of the news agency reported this detail not , but said that the management of the company abroad must be banned . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of this week Sal@@ man un@@ veil covering what the overthrow of the crane caused , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims took place in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later took place later this month . &quot;
the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group issued no statements about the collapse of the crane and their representatives were not available for an opinion .
&quot; the Royal decree did not critici@@ zed the group because of non @-@ current security measures , and because they were not co @-@ operated with mete@@ or@@ ologists . &quot;
&quot; dozens of cranes are surrounded by Mecca , Gros@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project , managed by the Bin @-@ Laden group . &quot;
the Bin Laden is connected with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger construction projects .
&quot; the late leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a full @-@ hour son who was dispos@@ s@@ essed of the family in the 1990 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom of pilgrimage , which at least once in a life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay hosp@@ it@@ alized .
&quot; government officials estimate that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to the relatives of the soldiers are willing to pay and the same sum is permanently injured . &quot;

B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen are over
&quot; British employ more and more arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry , &quot;
the number of qualified craftsmen in Eastern Europe has an increase behind them
&quot; in addition , this leads to 200 further screen@@ bu@@ g@@ fix stores , which aim at the crafts@@ man . &quot;
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q selling are closed across the country
&quot; Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that British control their ha@@ em@@ ers and brus@@ hes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their homes , &quot;
&quot; if you are sent to a hammer or a brush to the offensive of walls , you seem to appear to be a minority . &quot;
&quot; British are increasingly tra@@ des@@ men to carry do @-@ it jobs in their homes , so the leader of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Véronique Lau@@ ry , new manager of King@@ fis@@ her who owns the building markets chain , said that there is a large increase in the number of qualified arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe to offer the services to low prices . &quot;
&quot; as such , King@@ fis@@ her , 200 further screen@@ p@@ fix shops could be opened , which connect to tra@@ des@@ men and to add 60 sales sets of B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are met by women . &quot;
at the moment l@@ acked the men .
&quot; she said that it was necessary to exhibit to the growing demographic trends that have more feminine single households , which make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to shift that stronger towards a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our clients made up of women with 80 percent of the decisions made by the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .

function@@ aries of A@@ I / DO@@ B due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before judgment
at the State Court Kla@@ gen@@ furt have occurred on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball court @-@ book A@@ ich / DO@@ B for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and expul@@ sions .
the accused did not guilty .
one of them was also charged with abuse of abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the present process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the general pro@@ secutor Robert Ri@@ ffel @-@ walt , Robert Ri@@ ffel had gotten out in the preliminary examination that the accused was supposed to disp@@ ose of the accounts in the years 2006 to 2011 , about which they used to disp@@ ose into their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage caused the damage to around 400@@ ,000 Euro . &quot;
the sports equipment are also charged with financial institutions .
&quot; this fact , divided the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , Ri@@ chter@@ in Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
this should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; to re@@ vo@@ ke the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the Defence presented that the association was not a asset in any time . &quot;
&quot; the sports equipment would have spent only allowance for allowance , and for whom they had invested a lot of time and money in which they earned a lot of time and money - the pas@@ si@@ vity in 2001 amoun@@ ted to around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( approx . 4@@ 4,000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; back then we stood before the situation : do we carry the club down or block it ? &quot; , &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in a to@@ ot@@ vocation of a financial bank . &quot;
he decided to take this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all risks .
&quot; we have been making money , our life insurance has been laid down as safety at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said at the acceptance . &quot;
&quot; if agreed with the association , you can manage the money freely , there must be only no debts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , due to the financial - success the payout of the allowance for damage was decided by 1991 . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , they have only been part of the allowance for years later , namely from the year 2003 when a plus had been in the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the l@@ ump and not detail changes were sent down , the former Ob@@ mann explained the proceedings . &quot;
&quot; accounts and di@@ aries managed the two def@@ endants together , said the second def@@ endant . &quot;
why the ex@@ tras had not been disclosed to the association in detail and asked the Richter .
&quot; the association was not interested in detail for the financial expenditure , important unless the debt has been so important . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 against the general inquiries for abuse of ministers , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the bank account . &quot;
&quot; these were gone , the accused . &quot;
&quot; this securities account went on the name of the second def@@ endants and was not well @-@ known , according to the statement of the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; , &quot; wanted to know the Richter . &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the question for a long time .
&quot; then he said , he said that this is the best for the association . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of this money , the pro@@ secutor had placed in the room . &quot;
the co @-@ def@@ endant was kept informed himself the function@@ ary .
this bank has been referred to as &quot; claims . &quot;
why in@@ dem@@ nity ? , wanted to know Ri@@ chter@@ in and pro@@ secutor . &quot;
&quot; the first accused , he did not agree with this formulation , because the association had never suffered damage . &quot;
&quot; but what shall I do if the lawyer says , &apos; With this you are all out of the tailor . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; , &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the ten@@ er said , he never referred a c@@ ents salary , he only comp@@ lied with mi@@ le@@ money and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; he did pay 1,000 euros per month in addition , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
precise documents for the early years could not show the accused .
&quot; these are after an operation , in which everything had been judged correctly , no longer retained . &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter also had the second def@@ endant .
&quot; all expe@@ ditions are made in cash , so he must have to drive from his hometown to the Bank to Blei@@ burg , stated in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing is continued on the 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard St@@ ages further 30.000 Jobs
&quot; in addition , personnel recruitment for the company has been ongoing for three years in order to reduce more jobs at the start @-@ up of the company . &quot;
the ten@@ dering of the US @-@ computer He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) does not find an end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the American technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 bodies in its corporate group . &quot;
&quot; by doing so , costs in the amount of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) will be saved , shared the company on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the move will lead to a special load of about 2.7 billion dollars , which will start at the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; HP employed the end of the 2013 fiscal year / 14 yet , approximately 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;
pur@@ pose@@ ful the He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard stock were 2.3 percent .
&quot; the large @-@ scale company from the Califor@@ ni@@ an Pal@@ o Alto , currently spl@@ its up : thus , the computer and printing business will be bund@@ led again in a new society - separated from the future @-@ sensitive areas with computer servers and data for companies as well as other services . &quot;
both business parts are to be listed on the stock market .
&quot; a more disappointing PC @-@ sales as well as a weaker demand for company customers after its services , most of the world @-@ largest PC manufacturers after Len@@ ovo last year . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of July , the sales of both PC and printing presses grew by 1@@ 1.5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thereby the profits went back to 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP answers a spl@@ itting and massive position@@ ings to the changes in the industry .
&quot; the 76 @-@ year old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man gradually has responded late to the fact that customers can buy smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers , and getting more and more business to do online . &quot;
&quot; Whit@@ man restructuring plans will see a total of around 5@@ 5,000 positions . &quot;
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS learning mission
&quot; however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would have overwhel@@ m@@ ingly in favour of rejection : 54 per cent compared with it , 35 percent showed up appro@@ ving . &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence of Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police were deployed at the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a and water@@ lights for several hundred outlets .
Eur@@ one@@ ws @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Boz@@ si@@ k has experienced the violence of violence at the border control station .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke the border .
&quot; behind it , a police line had shape and behind the police officers , a water light stood ready . &quot;
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees began to throw stone , st@@ aves and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials firstly put down dou@@ ble@@ t spray .
then the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a .
much Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a was scattered towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees now have withdrawn some countries .
a pregnant and apparently @-@ last woman was carried out from the zone .
&quot; children , who had met the lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ a , cried out . &quot;
other refugees are sitting in themselves and suffered under breathing difficulty .
also the spokes@@ person of the Serbian police suffered injuries by the use of Tr@@ in@@ eng@@ a and Pfe@@ ffer@@ spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the U.S. staff
&quot; the world is observed when the U.S. staff are in two days , Wednesday and Thursday to meet the important decision whether the interest rates are raised for the first time in nearly a decade or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists , who were interviewed by Re@@ uters , found that the F@@ ed could do so , now thinks the F@@ ed will last even slightly longer and will keep interest rates at the current status of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates on N@@ UL@@ L .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank would possibly leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , guiding staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and only generate a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ru@@ y perspective on global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision will be announced at 20.@@ 00 CET on Thursday at 20.@@ 00 CET on Thursday .
de@@ ar@@ cher at the Delta State University called by apologi@@ zing for
&quot; after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later killed his colleagues and killed , Sh@@ annon wrote a note to say that he would &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could not make it happen , &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi said , &quot; &quot; writer , lecturer for geography and social education at Delta State University , the emergency number to 10 : 00 am Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and said , he was shot at someone and someone killed . &quot;
he &apos;s telling the staff of the emergency key that the police had to be sent to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I created my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also said that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , who will &quot; &quot; no man bother &quot; , &quot; but most likely will be upset . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not answer him . &quot;
there was no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I wanted it so sorry I could not und@@ o . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note he took 300 miles on the Delta State University , where he graduated eth@@ ane Schmidt , a professor of history , killing one &apos;s own life on Monday night when poli@@ c@@ emen climbed it . &quot;
&quot; dear President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he ignor@@ es nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs presentation . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , it &apos;s alleged that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also believed with Schmidt to have a relationship , said authorities on Tuesday , there are no information , no evidence of &quot; a &quot; three relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was repeated by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were married about seven years when a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced back 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , he and Pr@@ enti@@ st have had a daughter who is 19 and was destroyed on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were his daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ st worked online from home , following statement from L@@ ins@@ day K@@ now@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ st . &quot;
&quot; K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with him for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said K@@ now@@ les &quot;
&quot; said the police , he &apos;s relatives at a particular time on Monday to tell them , &quot; he does not go into prison . &quot;
&quot; when poli@@ c@@ emen climbed it on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in this night , his car went to the side , fled by foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; represented in the spring of 2015 , from the Delta State University a doctor title , like its c@@ ł@@ aw at the University of the University . &quot;
stars that have lost their god@@ d@@ inger
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his many years of partner in Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot;
actors also claimed to fight drugs in 2008 and in 2008 he was condemned for drug owners .
all that challenges certainly its toll .
EURO@@ POWER : Lufthansa builds the Group at stake
Lufthansa planning a large group restructuring .
the Lufthansa group wants to save a half billion euros per year alone with a better organization .
&quot; 150 of the world &apos;s approximately 1000 employees , the Group restructuring will cost the workplace . &quot;
the new negotiations are dealt with in the pilot @-@ trade union .
Lufthansa built up their company structure and evalu@@ ates the accounting values as well .
&quot; the aim of real@@ ignment is a contribution to about 500 million euros a year from cost and revenues , distributed the airline on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , in the future , there will be no more passenger on the passenger in the future . &quot;
the Bil@@ o@@ flu@@ in@@ ie Euro@@ logos are thereby being developed as independent as possible .
&quot; in the board team led by Chief Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr , Karl Ulrich Sch@@ aud will be responsible for Euro@@ logos . &quot;
&quot; with the new assignment , Spo@@ clock underlines the importance of Euro@@ logos , with which the Group will continue to play against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet at the future . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees was strong . &quot;
&quot; the airline companies under the umbrella of the Passage Air@@ line group , representing three quarters of annual sales of € 30 billion . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United is not able to play Mon@@ el@@ ang for dou@@ bling frac@@ ture
&quot; Luke Sha@@ w suffered from the Champions League of Manchester , with the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven a double bed of his right ball . &quot;
&quot; while this led to the left outside defen@@ ders to be used and exp@@ el it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play back in this season . &quot;
&quot; the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 year old Sha@@ w had broken into the PS@@ V area . &quot;
he was treated for nine minutes in the playing field and needed oxygen before getting into the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double ball bu@@ sty and is located in the hospital .
he will then move on tomorrow or perhaps one day later and operate in Manchester .
&quot; it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then fantastic plays , and then this is happening . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen sick@@ le .
he wept .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it will take six months and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escape a Red Card and the im@@ position of an sc@@ atter@@ ing .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had been mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an el@@ d@@ meter and a red map are par@@ amount .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et to Sha@@ w &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my path to recovery starts now , I will be stronger again . &quot;
here@@ after : Manchester United inv@@ ents the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat of the PS@@ V
the United Kingdom def@@ ender has an added incentive to recover from the European Championships in France until the coming June .
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury they are all very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg devast@@ ation as Mexico played at the World Cup 2014 at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , who was travelling in another direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I could not see the attack upon Luke . &quot;
&quot; talking with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels like that , I know how hard a thing can be . &quot;
I feel very bad there . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dad@@ o was also brought into hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ try by Chris Sm@@ ack .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that loves all parents soon : when your child loves a book , it will not last long until you know it nearly mem@@ orized . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite children &apos;s book was asked , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax , decided in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to recall my children , as it seems to always be an image or a message which we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; all nice and well , except that the ensu@@ ing paragraph , in which I allegedly describes the story of the book , instead rendering an indication of the movie version of 2012 , the new characters and details added to expand the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ olos @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , filled with his desire to see a real tree , &quot; &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose proper name The@@ odor Se@@ uss ho@@ w@@ ler was missing and the 1991 died , but totally unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this would not be suspi@@ ci@@ ously enough : the text submitted by Cameron reads , partly as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; though he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron loses the action of the book so little . here an un@@ named boy , like the local environment by cas@@ h@@ ates Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ckey , be@@ wil@@ ous being , &quot; that is referred to in the name of the trees , &quot; desol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR @-@ task was neg@@ ated to a hel@@ per that does not have read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row . &quot;
a down @-@ Street @-@ Spe@@ aker said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s constitu@@ tion@@ ist .
&quot; supervision confirmed that the text of Camer@@ ons employees was delivered , but there were no further direct comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with exclusion from England &apos;s team but it is still difficult
&quot; to encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , it &apos;s a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ res which England selected for the tour is a repetition of 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ ward win .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air &apos;s look may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batt@@ ing list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry any scars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali grows as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even when he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; this news @-@ based message : Adam Ly@@ th turns out of the England test cad@@ res , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as a new head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , to be difficult to analyse . &quot;
&quot; under his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions and the simple but hard reality is that the So@@ cket@@ poker players are based on results . &quot;
&quot; there were no questions under Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , as - and I told this - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , I had extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he then proposes further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance arrives . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not get such good performances , and this does not surprise me : he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; the question how much time a test drummer receives , to set his character is difficult . &quot;
&quot; there was seven chances here - like Sam Rob@@ son , before him , while Nick Comp@@ ton nine got . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance of home and down@@ wards .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that can be lifted , was that England first sat down in the Caribbean at first - when Ly@@ th was in peak - but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a stroke , which I highly value . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ Factor @-@ Cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire very early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us at a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which we met . &quot;
&quot; he must obtain at least the same chances before him before him , but this depends of course on the team assignment in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea , Mo@@ een beside Cook hits which would create an extra @-@ spin @-@ bow@@ lers and four Qui@@ cks would have emerged , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a stroke cannot strike there , and that left @-@ handed has already shown that it is a hot @-@ shot of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een may not have completed his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is he a number 3 for them and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he entered in 2001 as Open@@ er .
he immediately made a hundred or@@ us immediately and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited dealing with it he impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of back@@ ups which rise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the crew , England has made a few smart additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Qu@@ awar@@ dre@@ ary , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , could be a consultant for the test play could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nicest guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience , as it has been played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment to the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as players or as coach , and as Mah@@ ela he gave insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the previous one . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ l@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not employed at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team@@ sters do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must think that as when players are dependent on their jobs from the results .
such decisions are not taken in the heart .
the Bre@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit = Exclu@@ sive Britain from the EU ) could gain access to a flag@@ ged device by 2017 .
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ exploited restructuring strategy in order to hold Great Britain in the EU will be deeper with every day without the election of the genius Jer@@ emy ? is it Yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leaders of Labour and TU@@ C who were heavy on Tuesday on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at and commented that some member states , so deeply deb@@ ated in various crises , as the EU is now and not always from its own guilt , Britain itself created agenda with split ri@@ oting and disturbing contract changes , which they often do not want to be filled . &quot;
&quot; in Brighton , TU@@ C decided to take at its annual general meeting that it does not like it if they threaten the social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Ministers climb on summit , bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they are allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wishes a looking outside Britain in the interior of the EU tent , &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and shows that more and more short @-@ sighted ministers and officials have come to the point where they are , whether we remain or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cautious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an allies , but she has been in power for 10 years before it seems bad for her as it has happened over the exagger@@ ations long exc@@ els such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French President François Hollande refers to his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .

&quot; it &apos;s difficult to imagine that they will s@@ nat@@ ch a leg to help the self @-@ genius to prevent their energy better , Scotland can &apos;t want to avoid Scotland from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , perhaps some such ministers may even pur@@ se not make helpful comments , entirely at the SN@@ P style , during Britain &apos;s refer@@ ral surgery to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , susp@@ ects my friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a P@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has added nothing of its worth from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at its expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oligarchy of the press bar@@ one , as they did during the Tony Ben@@ n inspir@@ ational referendum , but in 1975 that included our entrance 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can be weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ euro opportun@@ ists who have made a name for himself as an &quot; EU sc@@ ade ban@@ anas in Brussels in the early 90 @-@ year . &quot;
&quot; with all his madness , Ed Mili@@ band , who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; it belonged to the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing jack@@ ets , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ able foreigners and the pseudo @-@ non @-@ countries , most of our great newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Blair similarly thought about her , but found that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage allowing better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him rather than going to his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ es@@ ian than Blair himself , when he dis@@ missed herself from the referendum of the EU , for Blair had rejected the principle of the un@@ passed constitution of the EU , which then opened by French and Dutch voters in 2005 to opened up a back@@ door . &quot;
the press has never betrayed him .
&quot; but the nice Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me his back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any time to forgive me - seems to be in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks Boy@@ sc@@ ott Mur@@ doch Strategy of 80 &apos;s years , an error at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take but he has to develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ l &apos;s official position to Europe is - I want it to be friendly - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ops traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ate tendency and the wil@@ lows of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ British can probably say yes to everyone . &quot;
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n &quot; but no Ben@@ n@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said when the boy@@ sc@@ outs was struggling with him not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns appointment of the voc@@ alist John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as a shadow advisor was a bad idea .
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ er years , when his old father tried to settle in television and loyal towards his Labour Cab@@ inet , without losing too far and losing his cabinet . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys combat was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to &quot; &quot; remain &quot; &quot; in all circumstances - Ben@@ n &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , nor did J@@ C told his fellow @-@ en@@ ites and members after all reports on their cl@@ ump convention on Monday night . &quot;
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the ma@@ el@@ strom of social media , a nest of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Cameron can &apos;t give a free ticket for Europe who permits him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ ral campaign for a course of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that he thinks .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities in EU membership - in line with their Ben@@ n@@ ite Bel@@ ag@@ ite economy - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion amongst left dissi@@ dents for who is a central ten@@ ure of dog@@ matic dispute .
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ity to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is highly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try , in all , to find a sense of their superi@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin squ@@ ander political capital , they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British when all this can be useless ? &quot;
&quot; the U.S. is already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government &apos;s power which I was calling on Monday by something that was called the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
expert critic@@ ise report from Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; allegations of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) was Lanc@@ et where she joined forces of Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes used after@@ no@@ ons .
p@@ he published the &quot; principle report &quot; last month and described it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
yet some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and commented on the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; an editorial written in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month , the &quot; extraordinary win@@ dy basis , &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the allegations under stone or sand build .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of Public Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor for Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the general public expects that &quot; the present best estimate is that &quot; &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less damaging than smoking &quot; &quot; based on a detailed verification of evidence and modeling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ disciplinary decisions ( multi @-@ c@@ rit@@ eria , Analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) to perform their opinions about the damages caused by different nicotine compounds ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was called a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managing director was previously served by British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
&quot; he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to Public Health in a Sustainability Report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants in the meeting agreed to obtain funds from an e @-@ cigarettes producer , but not the funding they have received after reports before from the tobacco firm Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the body are not supplied , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes Champions , some of which also provide industry funding in the paper . &quot;
some other participants in this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting the tobacco headed by p@@ he took part .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most of the criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the allegations of p@@ he says &quot; There is so far no evidence that there were no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes were used as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers .
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being during p@@ he , said that the claims from BM@@ J was previously responded to . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggest that health risks from e @-@ cigarettes are low in comparison to that , but we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; p@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what is proof and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80@@ ,000 people die yearly in a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking cost the National Health system two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by creating clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we meet our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give East@@ l@@ ders , says former head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the type of programs that will not be sent by other UK channels .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for making them public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard regard for the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried his six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sends out , which were clearly displayed by not sub@@ mitting ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus @-@ IT Committee under its investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to keep the circular fee , what I do not consider in mid or long term for a good idea , you should at least be on programs that others do not do or order in order . &quot;
they send the Voice in a prime time window because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this , is a joke , it &apos;s ridiculous it is of course nonsense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax schemes financed even without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ er@@ ders is another , admittedly true both own productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would give her right arm to it . &quot;
I am trying to see how this should be public @-@ right TV .
I don &apos;t think this would be the BBC ever to decrease .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who has conducted Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC inno@@ c@@ ence is to search for reviews &quot; because of the ambitions of people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments about the most popular ship@@ ments for the BBC input this again , which was the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ tag@@ ine presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows how to sell the East@@ man . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can pretty measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue that they have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
&quot; they put them in a window window , where no one ever wanted to see them . &quot;
&quot; for a broad@@ cast@@ or she said to the committee , &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from it . &quot;
&quot; of course , you think we all think that one gets a lot of money for 150 £ a year , but for people who &apos;s a lot of money for the 150 £ a year , I wonder if that &apos;s right , because they consume not much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ Chief David El@@ stein , who also announced before the Committee on Tuesday , called that the BBC should review its Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to educate and maintain . &quot;
he said just little of the BBC @-@ production was now officially classified as education - he said that there are 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in public @-@ law broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
&quot; on the matter of partnerships , El@@ stein said , the BBC should do more in areas like that of the pro@@ ms , told them that only a handful of television are shown and with the commercial Sen@@ ders alliances in order to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ son@@ o@@ gram &quot; can control brain cells through sound waves
&quot; the video shows how the ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des can change the direction in the moment , in which they are broad@@ cast@@ ed with sound impul@@ sive . &quot;
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by bro@@ o@@ ds of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny ne@@ ato@@ line change the direction in the moment they have with sound impulse , which have to be heard for the human hearing too high frequencies to be heard . &quot;
&quot; the stimul@@ i work through the switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultras@@ ound @-@ waves . &quot;
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity by light
&quot; the researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called son@@ o@@ gram , using ultras@@ ound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ bren@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain extraction , an invasive procedure which gives electric impulses into the brain &apos;s symptoms for treating the symptoms of Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
chocolate wor@@ ms usually do not react to ultras@@ ound but Chal@@ as@@ ani it was noted that they had done it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles .
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , reinforce the ultras@@ ound waves , which then enter into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; the reinforced ultras@@ ound waves function in structures , which are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ en@@ vi@@ als and found in the membran@@ es by some of the lit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; sound waves form the opening of these ion@@ als and activate the cells to which they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultras@@ ound @-@ controlled ne@@ ato@@ den , Hal@@ as@@ ani has genetically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ ists TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ ers carry . &quot;
&quot; when using ultras@@ ound on the altered creatures , the sound waves are strengthened by the micro @-@ waves and transmitted to wor@@ ms where they turn the changed mot@@ otic ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some similarities with op@@ to@@ gram , a trail @-@ breaking tool , which allows scientists to switch neur@@ ons with stimul@@ ants of light and switch . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gram could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be sent to an optical fiber for the desired place in the brain , Ni@@ ig@@ h frequency ultras@@ ound det@@ ach@@ ers may pass un@@ inhi@@ bited and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the accumulated human neur@@ ons temporarily for the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for life in a student residence
&quot; eleven years ago , I drew into a student dormit@@ ory in a student dormit@@ ory , still in faith in Ber@@ et and moral related vis@@ m , but only now I remember the tense smile of those who I anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ voice complaints about others . &quot;
&quot; most of what I have learned , can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules . &quot;
the move in student dormit@@ ory extends from slightly nerve wre@@ cking up to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to melt : people wh@@ ence you get , wh@@ ence you get , if you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you are &quot; frank@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in seriousness , guys , it &apos;s only a he@@ ap extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Make your questions and show interest .
&quot; it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you to find out the people that you like , unlike those you would not speak , even if your lashes in fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people leave .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into beverages , films , night events and municipal meet places , but they are also the places where people dress and put their under@@ wear . &quot;
related to : do not remember to start at the university with a relationship
In@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted received a rough handling at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student dormit@@ ories form a space @-@ to @-@ space B@@ um@@ mel culture which can be friendly and socially and lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be the hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go , but you have to go away , so that I have to get the energy back that I have used for interaction with you . &quot;
&quot; try to feel when a comb@@ atting of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted , and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cked . &quot;
apro@@ pos we@@ ar@@ ce : do it .
&quot; a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea , that a non @-@ closed door was an invitation . &quot;
he saw some things .
make friends by b@@ aking .
&quot; since you begin the UNI at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the knock is to the doors of people , to get less stran@@ gely than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years &apos; welcome in the neighborhood , I give you a little b@@ aking . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats is a great way to make friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to entertain you and will like to associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a constant b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; bad mixed l@@ ump from flour , sugar and gre@@ ase make people sleep sleeping when you anch@@ oring . &quot;
ste@@ al food is a common crime in student residence .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ aws of chicken is a rob@@ bery , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ? &quot;
check with the milk @-@ owner .
&quot; chances are good , they say to serve themselves , even when they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff is that annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced as my room@@ mate , who added to their milk as a washing @-@ up to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
it is now in prison .
they should not make noise the people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it &apos;s not just about being a human being , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ b to the people who sit in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hallway asked her neighbors , whether it makes them something to make Drum &amp; Bass somewhat qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
she reacted to that with even loud music .
&quot; when they finally stopped at 5 p.m. , she left her neighbors also two hours sleeping , before she left her own music , closed her door and completed her three @-@ hour trial . &quot;
would it be not romantic if your future spouse would like to enter into the same dor@@ m residence ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it would not be deeply embarrassing for you to hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage , going to them again and then have to see them every day and perhaps experience how they all share their common friends . &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future marriage partnership , try at least to talk a bit of reason to your under@@ dog . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that somebody has left his keys in his not @-@ minded room , the border between a ul@@ k and har@@ ass@@ ment is one , when it seems . &quot;

&quot; town@@ houses for refugees , all @-@ inclusive , Ger@@ ing@@ ear@@ ners &quot;
&quot; the real estate operators Markus Gil@@ dner , built in the Middle Frank@@ ish terr@@ aced houses for people who do not have much money . &quot;
&quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the alone mother and the bar@@ ing@@ ear@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; I show how one can still rely on cheap and well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees are coming onto the housing market .
&quot; the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes in knowing how quickly affordable housing can be created : it builds in a project terr@@ aced houses for refugees . &quot;
&quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees are to be displaced to the apartment market . &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or sne@@ ak@@ y has no sustainability .
because people remain a great part here .
&quot; in the light of the refugee flow , we also have enough living space in the next few decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey town@@ house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs the least place .
it makes integration easier .
that is different if it puts people in blocks of living .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are being built precisely in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees shall say , it is peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be easily modified according to their needs .
how much is the cost ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is situated on 18@@ 4 000 Euro , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six months have taken the building .
this is appropriate .
have the construction regulations prohi@@ bit their plans ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; I legally carried my project correctly . &quot;
especially complicated it is always the dro@@ pping Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ stu@@ d special structure and the space @-@ free regulation .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it is still under construction , who creates three apartments in a town@@ house three apartments , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities is missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how have the inhabitants responded to their town@@ house project ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : there were , which have been accused of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers . &quot;
what is definitely not right .
but exac@@ erb@@ ate you not the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : true : we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but built luxury homes that can hardly afford to afford more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people . &quot;
not only refugees but also the alone mother or the bar@@ ing@@ ear@@ ners .
I show how one can still rely on cheap and well @-@ priced .
therefore it is all about .

iOS 9 : how you get the new iPhone OS system if Apple update will be released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by entering the setting app , typing in &quot; &quot; gener@@ a &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; software update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the telephone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some are pushed to problems after the installation , since they get a error message that communic@@ ates the &quot; software update &quot; has failed . &quot;
&quot; to deal with the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush back or try to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
&quot; that may mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has the more likely to do this by mer@@ ging the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to remove apps and then re @-@ install it as soon as the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worth trying to make sure your mobile phone is loaded during the update , or is in the vicinity of a charger , so that the battery will be loaded . &quot;

&quot; in the city of Bremen you confirmed the accus@@ ations , but the consequences for the unusual incident have not yet been clear . &quot;
&quot; the thing is still in the examination , &quot; says it of the city of Bremen . &quot;

&quot; one of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed according to the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called to them that one may wait for him . &quot;
at this time the group was placed at the altitude of the B@@ FT gas station .
on the premises of the gas station there were also three persons .
&quot; one of these men now shou@@ ted the young , and stroke this one with the fist . &quot;
the victim suffered a nas@@ al cav@@ ity and ble@@ ed out of the nose .
&quot; when his two friends conquered and hur@@ ried on the bat , he initially led off his sacrifice . &quot;
from his friends the last young man was brought home .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with their own car up to the apartment and did not drive past several times .
&quot; when one does no longer saw the vehicle , the one went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was again attacked by the bat and another male person .
taking the help of a stroke is checked on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the last one had to be taken to hospital in medical care .
so far only a v@@ ague t@@ att@@ est lies ahead .
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters tall .
the second r@@ ack@@ et is about 1.@@ 65 metres high and was dressed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over office training breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ stand@@ ausen .
&quot; also , Sam@@ t@@ ner said Bernd Bor@@ mann , the sponsor@@ ing of Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried cab@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; despite many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are lucky : there , Dr. Frank Müller took over the practice of the field . &quot;
&quot; while UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ stand@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing on his successor in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a re @-@ construction phase Müller started the practice on October 12th , until then he will invest 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at the St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; sympathy with regard to Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l met , who currently completed their professional medical education in the early hospital and later to get into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the Mü@@ llers would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ stand@@ ausen and lau@@ ghing . &quot;
&quot; when it was far , I simply called it . &quot;
the couple Müller started the idea in future in A@@ sen@@ dorf to have their own practice in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he will see also soon his own boss . &quot;
and so one was agreed that the Mü@@ llers purchased the house with practice .
guest will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up in his medical study in Hannover , as well as in hospitals in several healthcare offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; currently he is engaged as a senior doctor in Sul@@ ingen , he was appointed a leading specialist in the Di@@ ep@@ wood in 2009 and is engaged in a honorary guest in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen in 2009 . &quot;
&quot; starting from 19 September , the practice for the new head will be prepared . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ stand@@ ausen is working as a home doctor , his wife H@@ UR@@ SE@@ L ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) has specialised in gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the Mü@@ llers , both Inter@@ nis@@ ts , want to settle down as house practitioners . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy is therefore out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
after the re@@ building the rooms are modern .
we will offer more ultras@@ ound examinations and long @-@ term and resili@@ ence and need a consultation room more .
&quot; furthermore , the ED@@ V will be completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a total of 50@@ 000 Euro includes the trav@@ eller within the framework of a funding programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euro ) , and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is being continued &quot; , &quot; stresses Sam@@ terri@@ er @-@ champion Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; approximately 2000 patients , according to the Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , each quarter come into the practice of the post @-@ ste@@ pl@@ ings , in the north @-@ German average business , it is about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is still another general practitioner of practice .
&quot; a positive side effect is by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains , according to UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ stand@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf . &quot;
if no successor had found it would have gone .
who visits the translation of an hour by the way also still look in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning of the fields .
&quot; its farewell ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors have been practicing for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ stand@@ ausen recalls . &quot;
a little melanchol@@ y they feel after the long time already .
&quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients are often seen , &quot; &quot; says Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; your man adds : &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; until now , I have always pressed on gardening , now could this be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grandchildren and travels with pleasure . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls will also be driven on our border line , &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mic@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain upright .
&quot; it is clear that everybody who wants to make a asylum application , this can also be &quot; &quot; granted &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people is par@@ amount .
&quot; sure , it is clear that there was clear signals &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; people need to know that we do not accept lim@@ it@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is weak@@ ened &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia
&quot; Croati@@ ans had previously announced the Croatian government to leave the upcoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances cor@@ ridors for refugees can also be established . &quot;
&quot; thus , the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ é@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach however did not . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ ridors is &quot; absolutely inakzeptabel &quot; , &quot; Slovenia itself will be the monitoring of the border - especially Hungary - intensify . &quot;
&quot; however , the border with Croatia is already controlled considerably as the borders of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister emphas@@ ised , Slovenia wants to re @-@ establish its borders for refugees but not . &quot;
&quot; every EU member needs to fill out its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ é@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; like the Croatian government , the first refugees would have attempted to travel in the night hours to Tuesday , to arrive at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d on the border crossing at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d . &quot;
the Croatian police could pick it up in the near ma@@ is@@ ations .
&quot; according to local media , ever since , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , always meet police @-@ vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is primarily about Syrian and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
also b@@ ail@@ ers and the Red Cross are already in action .
&quot; in the coming days they expect his country with some 4,000 refugees , said Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; we also supported buses from Pres@@ evo on the Maced@@ onian border crossing the Hungarian border to Greece so far , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , occurs , however , that it is necessary to propose certain routes : &quot; neither can we nor do we want to do this &quot; , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , at least in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived at the Ser@@ b border town Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; over Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the in@@ mates were on their way around 500 kilometres away from the Maced@@ onian border of Serbia around 500 kilometres .
&quot; we heard that Hungary has added , so the police has told us that we are to drive here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany . &quot;
&quot; as a consequence , it might now actually become a further shift in the current Balkan region of Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary to a little further west distance . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive options for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country was prepared for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees with appropriate plans for possible conditions .
&quot; he did not call it , but he pointed out that Croatia referred to as non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive options for border control . &quot;
lead strict controls to qualify for membership in Schengen .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , at the time since 2007 , the EU partners have gone through a good witness to the standards of border controls . &quot;
on the Austrian side behind the Hungarian border @-@ fence about 300 refugees continue to take place .
&quot; according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media report they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
the two border crossing Hor@@ gos and back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed according to the Hungarian authorities .
whether the remaining refugees wish to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Ser@@ b Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Do@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm Wed@@ nes@@ ian early on in Hor@@ gos : he consider the debates about ageing routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
at this moment it would not be a very high amount of refugees .
one could not say whether they would continue their trip to Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ per rates of migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee camps have already begun to distribute up@@ country maps on which alternative routes through Croatia are incorporated . &quot;
but the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the bor@@ row there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday morning the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ de@@ ans was sent in the border region .
stock @-@ h@@ ackers : Ukrainian pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ port@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard a ring of cy@@ ber criminal cases which has been accused of gaining insight into still un@@ released financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place red and PR news@@ wire . &quot;
&quot; with the exploited information , in@@ sider shops should be made on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; in this way , investig@@ ators rose to a total of over 100 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the present comparison shows that even those outside our state borders are ultimately captured , &quot; says it in the S@@ EC communication . &quot;
the trials against 32 more accus@@ ations were in the case di@@ gest@@ ed .
most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetrators are supposed to act in both the USA and eastern Europe .

&quot; it &apos;s all about life , so we are engaged in the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; says Jose@@ fine lam@@ m . &quot;
the consultant of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ Aid District is also available for questions and discussions as well as our honorary staff .
&quot; while some Pass@@ ant spontaneously turned to the chal@@ k and the sentence around &quot; &quot; my life watched &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop &quot; &quot; with the camper gone by the USA &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; do not suffer too long , continue reading , say ... &quot; as far as I am not yet &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again , on the margins of small discussions about the action of itself , life , dealing with the dying . &quot;
Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is just on site .
&quot; only when I make it clear to me that at the end of this world , I can live responsibly , &quot; says the director of the Diak@@ onischen Werkes Mannheim , who is together with the Car@@ it@@ ar @-@ Association of E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ es . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public call for effective action to 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good . &quot;
&quot; however , that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tablets , be understandable , after all , it is a very personal matter . &quot;
&quot; death and dying is still un@@ diagnosed with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jose@@ fine lam@@ bs , even though the Hosp@@ es movement has helped to open a lot in the last few years that people open up . &quot;
one estimate is made by Angel@@ ika Go@@ defect .
the mortality and O@@ bit@@ u@@ aries are among the volunteers in the first hour .
&quot; confronted by personal experiences with the topic , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in the eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ es sought by volunteers , she immediately reported it and had been with it in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers , 43 females and two men - the sufferers and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes , and hosp@@ ice @-@ Saint @-@ Vincent . &quot;
all they are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ica Go@@ def@@ roid can deal well with her job and experience the experiences and experiences made .
&quot; I see life from another alert , get it for dear and appreciate the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of the out@@ patient E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ it@@ ry service is free of charge and den@@ omin@@ ation@@ ally independent .
the financial support of the health insurance and donations of their relatives and associations enable the training as well as training and supervision of the mortality and O@@ bit@@ u@@ aries .
&quot; every two years , training courses for new employees are offered . &quot;
&quot; the tables described on Saturday are now in the house of the Luther@@ an Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot;
other personal wishes on post@@ cards can be noted also there .
F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed and Finance @-@ prospects for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ continued results for the final quarter and the Lie@@ ber@@ ant Gig@@ ant reports its profit from a whole year because of the weak@@ est demand for cargo services and higher costs in its bo@@ wel service .
&quot; the company also said that she is planning to hire about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this point in the past year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to susp@@ end 50,000 Se@@ ason for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex p said to earn a win between 10.@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 billion in the financial year , which ends in May , 20 cent less than the previous forecast . &quot;
analysts available according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower view is despite the price increases , which amount to 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and in spite of the higher ass@@ aults of bo@@ d@@ makers of heavy and large packages , which are ex@@ alted in November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it was nonetheless expected that the result compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and because of growth in online commerce . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides solid revenue if you consider the weaker economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for holiday @-@ employment were announced one day later than those of the Riv@@ al U@@ PS , which is planning to cancel the same number as last year , roughly the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter that came to an end on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex has earned € 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research and asked analysts . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ ack@@ men said analysts were expecting 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
&quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has taken a decline in international pri@@ ori@@ tizing shipping which will st@@ agn@@ ate sales in its unit express delivery . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales at the bo@@ d@@ airline rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express Unit recorded higher earnings based on higher prices , while earnings declined because of higher labour costs in the cargo business . &quot;
&quot; market trade , about an hour before opening , refu@@ elling the F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ shares by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11th . &quot;

the central bank has a two @-@ fold contract from Congress : maxim@@ izing the US job and prices here stable .
but since the big recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is a failed third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate might be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ dict it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled from the unprecedented incentive caused by the close to zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
&quot; though most data on the economy show that it is solid , the recent turmoil in the global financial markets would make the already cautious F@@ ed represent@@ ant to increase these volati@@ lity by raising interest in federal government - and be it only one quarter of the percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation is primarily the most important thing to observe , &quot; &quot; said Lin@@ d@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief econom@@ ists at the Mak@@ ler@@ firm embro@@ ider@@ y Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pretext , not to increase the interest rate , the increased insecurity about the global market is enough justification , continued to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is doing is emerging as a financial market itself .
&quot; about half of econom@@ ists who were recently interviewed by Bloomberg , have predicted an atom@@ ization this week . &quot;
&quot; however , the financial markets expect the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance of raising an increase . &quot;
&quot; this points to a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strateg@@ ists fall off the strike by exercising that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial The average value of 22@@ 8.@@ 89 points or a 1,4 % on 16.@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by anticip@@ ation that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence during this week , said John Lon@@ sky , Chef@@ ö@@ kon@@ om at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would highlight the propositions at this time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does so , she would have to go very far in her statement to put down the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argued that an increase in financial markets would put down the financial markets , because they would remove the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act . &quot;
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow shar@@ pen@@ ing of the mon@@ olith@@ ic conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ella had said in the spring and in early summer , that in spite of the complaints from Liber@@ al that more economic progress was needed , an increase in the proposition . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slo@@ wed down , the improvement in the labour market was solid . &quot;
&quot; unemployment rate sank from 5.2 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed looks as full employment . &quot;
wages have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation continued at the annual aim of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason had temporary effects of much lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them due to tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chef@@ ö@@ kon@@ om with Pantheon Macro@@ economics . &quot;
but financial markets grew up at the end of last month after China invested its currency .
&quot; Dow Jones Industrial The average worth more than 16 % in May by more than 16 % , when investors were afraid that the overall growth of Chinese economy would imp@@ aired global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered to this month , whereby the Dow is now almost 10 % below the level of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market upheav@@ als affect the complex calculation , when you increase the interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy have not appeared in recent weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins in this session , said Stephen D. O@@ lining , Senior Research Fel@@ low on U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the U.S. staff . &quot;
&quot; now , he pre@@ dict that she will wait at least a month to better get a grip on . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in the decision making it decision making . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank had been enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere note of the former Chief of Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could be narro@@ wed its monetary expansion &quot; &quot; narro@@ wed con@@ fu@@ sions around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly being tw@@ ined , they can be monitored by the F@@ ed representatives , but also provide advice on developments in other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; its decision @-@ making is &quot; more art as a science , &quot; Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA . , re@@ marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions on financial market movements that have apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; L@@ acker , a voted member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which advocates a tax reduction , held decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark interest in three sessions &quot; in spite of limited economic impact on the growth in the U.S. &quot; , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives re@@ vert these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability just during a severe crisis such as market re@@ unification in 2008 , Adam S. poses , former member of the Committee on the interest rate of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; recent turmoil will not come close to this layer , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it certainly does not want to get into the situation where they are afraid of a raise , because the markets are more exciting , &quot; &quot; Poznań , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still lacks the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think they should hurry ahead . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
&quot; getting warm welcome , not without the engagement of innumerable volunteers . &quot;
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ selfish asylum seekers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
she also teaches with her 74 rounds .
every Thursday she is doing it at the App@@ ill@@ inger Street .
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is quite different from teaching than at a right school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande encourages food for healthy breastfeeding
&quot; the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS is trying to explain in shocking way women on how important good nutrition is painted during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies , which are painted on br@@ ist@@ les that are painted with portra@@ y@@ als of unhealthy foods . &quot;
&quot; mother &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , fat , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all nutrients they need to establish a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; because of the additional energy requirements , pregnant and adolescents are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research findings indicate that higher cal@@ orie intake did not supply the only di@@ ä@@ te@@ tic adaptation to the mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet calcul@@ ates actually the genes of their babies and it protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , a healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively impact the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the Municipal Council Bern@@ ried authorized the construction of € 2.3 million of the sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ stone building at Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Centre come step by step forward : in the recent Joint Council meeting the component of the project was dis@@ continued without major discussions .
&quot; previously , the Panel , among other things , had decided still a request for a &quot; &quot; legal &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; exemp@@ ted &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tive &quot; &quot; from valid cultivation plan . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; exception &quot; there was the permit for a special form of roof construction .
&quot; according to the fact , a &quot; &quot; saddle roof @-@ roof @-@ roof@@ ed &quot; &quot; is intended to be built with non @-@ sufficient First and Dach@@ stein . &quot;
&quot; background of the planning is the intended use of the roof space for solar power plants : &quot; &quot; this is how we get a wonderfully large South @-@ magazine &quot; , &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; liberation &quot; again , it was again around the roof covering , which is stipul@@ ated for energetic reasons - different than in the cultivation plan - below ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; this is why a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore needed because the development plan does not permit any &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; with respect to the roof incl@@ ination , whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der municipal council is generally restric@@ tive with liber@@ ating problems . &quot;
&quot; however , at the turn@@ table building , however , this is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the turn@@ stone building at the Sports Centre is a collaborative project in the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
the cost of around 2.3 million euros is calculated .
grants are expected from school and grass@@ roots support .
&quot; in the next process of progress , the building application for the 18 x 36 metres large hall will now be submitted to the Administration for the exam . &quot;
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is supposed to be closed early as planned - namely 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) became the new Medical Director at the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
the station as well as the majority of employees draw up from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg towards Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; those see the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the County , who confirmed Land@@ tra@@ tin Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot;
&quot; the Supervisory Board , however , decided to make a decision on the Supervisory Board and the conven@@ es on the next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; should the plans be implemented , everyone of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority should move with fishermen and the further existing inside stop to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the staff , who cannot be offered with G@@ ong@@ au , is to be offered in Wei@@ l@@ heim an workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot;
the staff are informed about the plans .
&quot; triggered the change by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of this year and now changes private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; the question of who is to commence our follow @-@ up came according to Jo@@ chner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; , &quot; which was ready to take over the line from 1 October and to move with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is in any case a &quot; &quot; upgrading &quot; &quot; and a distribution of the range in &quot; &quot; Interior medicine &quot; , &quot; so Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot;
fishermen is specialised in p@@ ac@@ em@@ aker and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the inner station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic disorders .
&quot; access to the next two years is to be fishermen with his team , when the Supervisory Board agrees to give up both houses , until the next year , the former hospital of Kn@@ app@@ y , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the County has planned this for 2018 when the continuing recovery at the hospital Wei@@ l@@ heim was completed . &quot;
&quot; Land@@ tra@@ tin Jo@@ chner @-@ White , which is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , joined rum@@ ors , that the house , which is owned by the federal government in the future , should be used as an accommodation for asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; the end I turn out . how to continue with the property , Jo@@ chner @-@ White could not say , there are several reflections . &quot;
&quot; at present , there is a short @-@ time maintenance of the Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chi@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; what better did not happen to us , such an occasion does not come back , &quot; says Fischer talks about the Qu@@ asi Moving on the Le@@ ch , which was positively accepted by the staff &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house where fishermen have worked as a chief specialist for over 30 years , did not exist . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closure , departments have been closed , for example the surgery and the Obst@@ etri@@ cs . &quot;
the hand@@ wheel of the Rhine @-@ N@@ eck@@ ar lions are called tonight ( 20.@@ 3 p.m. ) at the Berg@@ ische HC .

two tractor riders were seriously injured during their corn on Tuesday morning by Sh@@ uts .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a ma@@ is@@ field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( district of Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters were in use , as the police declared . &quot;
after a nut@@ shell that suffered a 63@@ U and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man serious injury and were brought in hospitals .
&quot; however , exactly the accident could come to an accident , it was first unclear . &quot;
the criminals do not identify .

an incident took place the police for the gul@@ f of the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds ran from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
&quot; in the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , the young people were killed and their cor@@ pse was thrown into a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
a long missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate has fallen victim to a victim of a violent crime .
&quot; the funeral of the young woman was found at the Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on Kaiser@@ slau@@ tern , such as pro@@ secutor &apos;s office and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as a test suspected , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old took place at the service of 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who put in fact the indication and lead the investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the cor@@ pse . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday mor@@ nings after they had not been missed home after a visit to a autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
the investig@@ ators look first to personal belon@@ gings when looking for a young woman .
&quot; during questionn@@ aires and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the Ver@@ mis@@ sten , one finally turned out a tat@@ too against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the mut@@ in@@ ous perpetrators led the police into a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ bi@@ ased authorities were report@@ edly killed in the police gate , which was killed 16 @-@ year @-@ old and the cor@@ pse was put into the channel . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the Haf@@ ner on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators lay the stroke of him . &quot;
&quot; supp@@ er on the near@@ er circumstances of fact , the further investigation shall be brought . &quot;
refugees need accommodations : study warned of housing .
the situation on the German apartment market is tense .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable prices .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution operations in the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the incoming refugees and those seeking refugees from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that are already over@@ bur@@ dened in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with some weak citizens in order to find the last affordable housing .
&quot; to meet the demand for affordable housing , it would have to build 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; at this conclusion , a study comes into the mandate of the &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are completed in Germany . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there are 14@@ 0.000 apartments . &quot;
&quot; refugees are no longer required for the first three months of their stay , than to seek asylum seekers in an Initi@@ al shelter . &quot;
many people come across the apartment market and go to the long sn@@ akes in front of the rentals .
&quot; according to Federal Statisti@@ cal Federal Institute , in the last year , less than half of all asylum seekers have lived for rent . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing amount of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes considerable om@@ is@@ sions in the housing politics of the last years .
Germany &apos;s going to be a housing deficit from year to year bigger .
&quot; were currently missing in the metropolitan areas already about 77@@ ,000 units , compl@@ ained Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals have lived in large cities with not@@ ched in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed in@@ definitely in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot; due to the flu@@ kes in the apartment market un@@ tarily longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
&quot; in large cities , the number of square meter per capita has dropped again in recent years . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the alliance of &quot; social housing &quot; suggests a restart . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives for social housing should be restored . &quot;
so this could be wai@@ ved on the land tax rate and the land tax for promoted apartments will be suspended .
&quot; furthermore , the organising attractive tax shut@@ down options are necessary . &quot;
the Förder@@ verein for Refu@@ ge@@ es @-@ Kf@@ W @-@ Kf@@ W is right now well in towns and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , at the Mont@@ ag@@ evening with 18@@ 4 million euros , more than half of the available some 300 million euros have been called up . &quot;
now the project could even be gest@@ ed .
refugees have free terrain : Croatia and Slovenia aimed at corridor
&quot; after Hungary is practically no longer being crossed , as more and more refugees choose the way for Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces the passing on Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but dangerous is the route but still .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken with the Sloven@@ ian interior minister@@ ial secretary , and if it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the de@@ preci@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to reach Europe from there to Western Europe . &quot;
500 people were on the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik reported the Croatian TV station RT@@ L .
Hungary had its border to refugees on the day before .
&quot; new laws , which entered into force on the same day , render them fairly superf@@ lu@@ ous in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to let refugees happen .
Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic : &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this possibility .
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something . &quot;
however some people who do not want to live in Croatia .
&quot; in the morning , Croatian police had taken up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country . &quot;
&quot; most of these are media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they arrived either by bus and Ta@@ xen in the Ser@@ b border town Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival she would have tried to walk on foot over the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border the refugees do not reach the f@@ ences .
&quot; but this holds other dangers after this , there are sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
de@@ mining plans should now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after the closure of the border to Hungary , there is hardly any more refugees . &quot;
on Tuesday the police attacked 3@@ 66 people .
shortly before Tor@@ clas@@ p on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws levels the exit and damage to the bor@@ der@@ ship as a crime .
&quot; therefore , in the South Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eged , were only introduced in criminal proceedings . &quot;
pr@@ un@@ ed adhesi@@ on adhesi@@ on to five years and the deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authorities , on Tuesday took the &quot; Tran@@ sitting &quot; with a total of 94 refugee amounts , almost all of which - 93 - the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
beneath the applicant were 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people .
there were also 40 refugees on the Wednesday morning .
&quot; practically , no one has a prospect of granted asylum for Hungary . &quot;
&quot; after ung@@ ar@@ ised view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the exp@@ ired asylum seekers should be ported there .
in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there were only a few hundred refugees .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke the workers began to end up .
they gathered the trash one , the tens of thousands in the past weeks left at the road@@ side . &quot;
pl@@ ural gri@@ lle have been di@@ re and one of the recording camp in the border town was rebuilt .
&quot; to the aim of this overthrow , no one wanted to express . &quot;
Austria is only a few refugees following the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 migrants were still in the country but still in the country . &quot;
about 1400 people in Salzburg are waiting for the continuing driving to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was hal@@ ted in the morning at the order of German authorities .
in free@@ wheel there were regularly smaller groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor ran &quot; str@@ anded &quot; about the border
&quot; we were busy following the bridge for@@ ged on Sunday with the elevator , when suddenly ten people were standing with rice star@@ ters at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein @-@ mayor Alois Br@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; but because Germany was surprising on Sunday because of the refugee flow , the railway traffic with Austria was closed for her in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; so the city who immediately offered his help and sub@@ str@@ anded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border to the Near Pass@@ au . &quot;
before we did the un@@ hoped guests first of all times with J@@ unk@@ ard and Be@@ ver@@ ages .
&quot; we said the same , we bring it by car to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; it was a matter of course , for us , &quot; says the Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t let it take to give a generous donation - 100 euros for fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; it was very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening in Wels on Sunday evening , from ICE entered a regional train to Pass@@ au , in order to attempt it to Germany at the short notice that the railway traffic to Germany was dis@@ continued but still trying to cross the border . &quot;
&quot; the regional train , however , was stopped at the Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn . &quot;
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border sur@@ passes is generally high in the course .
the Br@@ ücken@@ fest association with the Bav@@ arian neighbors on Sunday soci@@ ably , tags previously a branches for sports - organised by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has sent more tens , tens of thousands of us , is a logical result of a apparent policy : &quot;
&quot; rather than in the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , rather than help with the establishment of structures , human@@ eness ensure public opinion has advanced and publicly the attitude of the Hungarian Government in the district of National Socialism . &quot;
lending of these policies are not just those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted in the bor@@ dering areas with chaotic conditions .
&quot; the whis@@ pering will have to notice that the &quot; &quot; stran@@ gely &quot; &quot; that invited them and welcome , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; there will be a major challenge in the face of the ongoing refugee streams and spending , in case of decent conditions for seeking protection . &quot;
&quot; and there will be an even greater one - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; finally on the search for 3@@ 5.000 har@@ ms , Quar@@ ter@@ edo &quot;
Konrad has full hands with the refugee @-@ power .
Christian Konrad is used to take his word weight .
the government used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen ban@@ kers to find Qu@@ arti@@ ere for the thousands of refugees .
&quot; the chaos of the first survey centre , Tra@@ is@@ kirchen already has to get a handle on the handle . &quot;
&quot; we do not have homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot;
&quot; lodging of 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was without great turmoil , said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot;
the Interior Ministry spoke on the basis of a &apos; cr@@ isen@@ y situation . &quot;
&quot; overall , Konrad ends with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 Quar@@ ters in the hot year . &quot;
&quot; to meet the number , you will have to find 3@@ 5.000 accommodations in the next few weeks - 20,000 will provide the countries , 15,000 of the league . &quot;
&quot; should it be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; said Con@@ rad . &quot;
he has already held talks with the merchants .
they would have assured him even for the upcoming refugees Qu@@ arti@@ ere .
&quot; in Upper Austria it is good , &quot; Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er said . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar is supported by Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , who will be clarified , as the church will help . &quot;
&quot; great expectations are also applied to the protection of asylum in the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; helping us &quot; . &quot; &quot;
on the platform private persons can easily offer accommodation .
&quot; in addition , one hopes that hotels in the winter will be empty . &quot;
&quot; finally , Konrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards for the accommodation as &apos; very high . &quot;
&quot; in times of times , it cannot be that Qu@@ arti@@ fic@@ ers must stick to a certain amount of the hand @-@ holder or size of the actu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; for a fixed time , &quot; &quot; not@@ aries &quot; &quot; would have to be considered . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Interior Ministry , he is successful with his experience , given by Konrad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentleman , who you cannot listen to the truth without any further notice . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er , the Republic does not cause any costs , as explained by itself . &quot;
your employees want to raise them up to four to four .
my own source search has not been successful so far .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as office .
&quot; however , there is apparently problems with the permit . &quot;
Linz calls for better distribution
&quot; for the first time , the opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for accommodation is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment when one could accommodate the parties involved without these measures , &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for the emergency , however , further sites are to be checked for the servic@@ e@@ ability . &quot;
the role of the city was upon the division of the refugees within the federal state .
other districts have to make their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telep@@ hon@@ y with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) governor of the Monday published the further action in the refugee question .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer showed me that the German borders are not to be rub@@ bed .
the further journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany will continue to be possible .
however there are now the corresponding border controls .
special suits with refugees after Germany will not give it any more .
but the seek@@ er @-@ seekers would then be taken with regular trains to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU Member States , P@@ us@@ inger once again called for enhanced solidarity in the refugee question . &quot;
&quot; that now Austria leads to its boundaries once more , is a logical consequence &quot; out of the procedure of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is a question of time
the &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; company in the Lin@@ zer Industrial line is officially complete .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the managed IT Group is moved into ( 2@@ 700 square meters ) , the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meters ) is intended to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area . &quot;
&quot; in our IT , the clever heads are our raw material - and we must try that they work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T @-@ leader Hannes Swoboda . &quot;
he could imagine investing in Star@@ tup from new ship@@ yard and later on which to act .
&quot; right from the start , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the Tech@@ center , 3.@@ 3 million euros from Tech@@ center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is respected by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 2@@ 700 square meters of rest in the building are rented already , for another 40 percent there will be requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ ist opened second business in the Arctic
in the new shop Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are the centre of attention .
&quot; actually , Jut@@ ta wanted to make a dog impres@@ sively . &quot;
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year in@@ hab@@ ist of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt ar@@ cades : ultimately it now has increase the increase in the form of another business location .
&quot; sold in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the shop , in which it sells among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and gar@@ ment of different manufacturers now it is all about dam &apos;s hand@@ bags in the Fur@@ la brand , w@@ allets are from 75 euros . &quot;
bigger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
&quot; previously , several weeks had been rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I have long over@@ laid back whether I have to open a shop , &quot; &quot; says wide . &quot;
&quot; decisive for the decision was among other things that also the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of an own location , where only her hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the mer@@ ciful in the big room Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even has Italian roots . &quot;
their fashion @-@ interest has been broad from her mother to the cradle .
&quot; the most , if something developed and I can show new trends with performance prices . &quot;
why so some woman to the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in discour@@ agement will also be able to answer the business@@ woman with last security .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag has enhanced each out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ al@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are named An@@ ders .
&quot; this characteristic also connects with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president wants . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether he is revealed to xen@@ opho@@ bic in journ@@ alism or journalists or gap in the international crisis policy - the applicant indicates the presidential campaign to raise the election campaign .
and cut off well .
&quot; this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grandparents of the property s@@ lic@@ ates . &quot;
the New Yor@@ kers with the su@@ ck@@ ery is many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road a term .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ town is about -@@ zig corners with it related .
&quot; his grand@@ si@@ re came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the Elec@@ toral mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone L@@ del turned into a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villagers think about their goal to become more powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that somehow we find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in your poe@@ tic kind , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
the native k@@ all@@ anes has turned a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous explo@@ sives to which beside Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mod@@ esty , comes in &quot; kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) , too word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
at the heart of the heart he did not get there .
&quot; although there was respect for the performance of the family , but also tends to think that Tr@@ ump &quot; is already a ta@@ w@@ ling , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; apart from the nickname of the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; - for high@@ es : the coun@@ sel , she says . &quot;
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
&quot; the tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began 1885 , when the later grandfather emigr@@ ated and opened a pub for the min@@ er in the USA . &quot;
foundations of the real estate company were first real estate sales in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy , her wish to return for a long time to the home , whi@@ p on the Bav@@ arian State , to whom the Palat@@ inate had belonged . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once removed without the approval , the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ isches History and Volk@@ sk@@ im , Roland Paul , was declared the film start . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emi@@ grant . &quot;
this is contrast to the sometimes striking statements of the descendants .
&quot; I have repeatedly talked about the Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall , to avoid illegal immigrants . &quot;
&quot; just as the pol@@ tic , that is not so person@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote relationship &quot; m@@ umps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was an el@@ dest tri@@ ump , the Op@@ a was sal@@ ated Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
the winem@@ aker at retirement sees the American rather dist@@ ancing himself . he is always so open .
does he believe that Tr@@ ump will come ?
&quot; I cannot imagine it , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never dealt with K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the Pen@@ version Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ r@@ amm is mentioned like man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz had ended at a visit something for the Church &apos;s Church , which was generally good . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine the Donald of Donald , &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they were wild@@ fires better if he doesn &apos;t want the choice , because &quot; it has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had had the seed at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics like him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ cks Sarah Kr@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my President is not it , &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; grapes are ripe without the president of Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els Film , for which Tr@@ ump got long inter@@ vie@@ we@@ e have seen 12 000 Kin@@ o@@ ers , also in the United States and interest . &quot;

in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain village villages . &quot;
in the neighboring country the local club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
a &quot; mountain village &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be exp@@ elled as a reserve .
&quot; Seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite the attempts of Nine , to take over loss of leadership in today &apos;s show &quot;
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson continues to report to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als but there were no big shifts in the reviews for today .
the breakfast show by Nine was broadcast by the Federal Capital as the Mal@@ col@@ m turn@@ around the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Samantha Ar@@ my@@ days , put in London as part of a week @-@ week series of international broad@@ casts to which Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cun . &quot;
&quot; this downside of the resistance , for Australian TV spectators , did not seem to play a part because Sun@@ rise had an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators among the five major cities , compared with today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today a slight increase as compared to ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today the gap to Sun@@ rise has been closed during the last few months .
&quot; in August today , the average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 reached a comparison to the 33@@ 0.000 from Sun@@ rise in August today . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year the gap between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; until now in September Sun@@ rise has been on average 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happened every morning .
the winds of change concern these days more than the Parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar of R@@ t@@ to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently we@@ ather@@ ed father , who nest@@ les with his two children on the New Zealand coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators . &quot;
critics had wondered whether Thom@@ son got a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with € 1,@@ 136 million and hit easily The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ B@@ L ( 7@@ 26 000 ) . &quot;
Seven had mixed results in the evening two by The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 p.m. ) The new qui@@ z show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe , on the average of 44@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 p.m. to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped into 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday night the first half hour from The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour of € 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; the decrease in the quot@@ a of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be hope@@ ful that Hot @-@ Se@@ at ultimately will assert itself at 17 : 30 . &quot;

the final three votes in line : Bachelor Sam wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery un@@ veiled ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have apparently wis@@ s@@ ingly apparently , who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at which Sam wood in The Bachelor &apos;s bach@@ elor is , was wrapped in the greatest secret . &quot;
and none of the remaining left @-@ born girls will certainly not show whether to the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana E@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows the day before made out of three two , you might have accidentally designed a note about who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood continues his lips until the finals on Thursday sealed .
&quot; all three women have figured out on a ly@@ ric way , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should receive the last rose ? &quot; , &quot; could her answer to the kill@@ ers who won the heart of the torrent . &quot;
je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both called fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner in wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sar@@ &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s , I noticed that they were pretty compati@@ bly , and I thought it was thought of the whole course of the show , &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; she added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam is well suited as a couple .
&quot; from their perspective , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home @-@ visit last week did her clearly that wood &quot; &quot; could be &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally adjusted to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked to choose the wood , if not her , there she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I do not know if I can say this , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the left @-@ born girls alike - it is a draw from S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30@@ am , on Ten . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests to his impressive performance day at the end of last year .
&quot; but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula , and it looks like a wise decision . &quot;
&quot; some trainers would have ban@@ ished for the rest of the game to the Bank than he lost a bar@@ angel , as it did the Aussie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by @-@ Liga Conver@@ ting at his first pun@@ t line on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota . &quot;
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave her the next chance to a Pun@@ t Return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to show its true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of counting its ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
Hay@@ s@@ ula reinforced Hay@@ ne on his press conference publicly during the press conference .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man told that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams Co@@ ordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who visits him , his playful bas@@ ang and worry about the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne was restored in a pun@@ t , restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vi@@ kings . &quot;
it was certainly not the start which Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian Ge@@ de@@ d@@ ship had hoped for his N@@ FL @-@ debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble cur@@ sing the playing field and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 because he could not conceive within his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne resem@@ bled the car@@ ver with his Ori@@ gin debut in 2007 when a passport in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a Tr@@ y of Queensland .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

the free voters ask for the high amount of refugees the attitude of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
&quot; party and Leader of Hubert Ai@@ wa@@ ger appeared before a serious crisis at Bay@@ erns schools at the beginning of a serious crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , when there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to support schools before collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get gra@@ dations in the Bav@@ arian educational system . &quot;
the country @-@ pan of the free voters will last till Friday in the fran@@ que commune .
&quot; actually , there were other main themes . &quot;
but the record number of the refugees now also dominates the free vot@@ er meetings .
&quot; of course , the topic for asylum is over@@ lap , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of United Nations @-@ protected zones for refugees in Syria , just as they did during the 1990s war in the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; so it is not going on , we must remember the causes , &quot; said the free vot@@ er boss . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to t@@ oss the free voters as fast as possible .
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for administrative courts that are responsible for asylum : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
the F@@ W boss critici@@ zed that several federal states are not consistently critici@@ zed : &quot; we need nationwide standards of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; Bavaria Shi@@ ps , others not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; since we have to become more solid . &quot;
&quot; but the national policy should not fall under the table in big wall@@ bars . &quot;
a recent years of durability still remains on the agenda : the policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Kul@@ tus@@ can Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) had been tested in 47 colleges in the pilot &quot; high level plus &quot; , in which a pro@@ long@@ ation of g@@ ymnasi@@ ums is tested from three to four years - the result will then again be nine years down to the SL@@ C . &quot;
but this is not far enough .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all G@@ ymnasi@@ ums that want it .
&quot; free travel at G@@ 9 everywhere , where it is desired . &quot;

4 People killed after police officers g@@ ra@@ yed on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four men , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after the police had been wat@@ ered in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke off on Tuesday evening in the district of R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , approximately 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief Planning Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered from a police station , some of them put together je@@ wels and fire@@ bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have started a lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ a and then shot in the air before dro@@ wning on rubber .
&quot; 20 soldiers and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , of which it is known to be killing , but traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , seems to produce such high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nepal , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ divorce said that new provinces , which would be formed under the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the De@@ dic@@ s who want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were reported in violent sho@@ cks since the 10th century . &quot;
&quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country in provinces , an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which was centrally governed by centuries . &quot;
&quot; working on a new constitution was on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lature had accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legis@@ lature had voted this week on specific cl@@ auses in the pre@@ diction in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;

&quot; the Inter@@ act , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der company &quot; &quot; System @-@ Bau &quot; , &quot; set out its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the urban development committee of the European Council . &quot;
originally that point had stood on the not @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; under the pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ am brought about the offensive by the system @-@ construction management at the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered an answer to all questions , &quot; he said before the members in the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
yet it is good to be able to encounter all rum@@ ours now .
this is about ten to twelve million Euros . the project has been in discussion for months .
&quot; fierce reactions from the sea land@@ owners who have come to the meeting , the images and new details were devoted to the hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ owner owner and a member of the association by An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ained : &quot; this is a huge block , which overlooks all the other bushes . &quot;
&quot; moreover , he fears such a number of other project critics that the traffic through the intended size of the system would increase greatly , &quot; there must be whole bus@@ itations to be reck@@ oned , so that &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly on the well a hect@@ are of the former pub is still open , it is still open . &quot;
there is no operator .
&quot; first , we must have a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end . &quot;
&quot; because this is not even missing , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google will launches the dou@@ bling donations campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
&quot; Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . o ) announced a dou@@ bling donations campaign , which is to help 11 million dollars for humanitarian organisations , who have survived the thousands of refugees because they escape from the war torn and impover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach when announ@@ cing the donations of his blog .
&quot; instead of making a manager make an announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google co @-@ assistant who fled to her family from Kab@@ ul , she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; on our journey there were many dark railway and buses , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are looking desper@@ ately for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said the first global funds raised to a value of 5.5 million to google@@ .com / Schl@@ er@@ isk to 11 million $ doubled .
&quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , who has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;

coverage of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; adapting by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
for slightly overweight diabe@@ tics weight loss can be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take after a new study at least five years .
it is still too early to say if easily overweight people with diabetes after the weight loss surgery are longer living than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the death data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert on weight loss surgery , which auth@@ ored an editorial to the new study in J@@ ama . &quot;
&quot; weight loss or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to take food .
&quot; over the years , obesity have proven to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies were carried out by people who are abnormal fat with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) from 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a degree of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I from 25 or more shows that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I about 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which she had collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity and stomach upset - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people , which were slightly overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those subjected to this surgery , sank from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who did not involve non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at the same time . &quot;
&quot; among those who are subjected to surgical procedure , at 36 % the diabetes disorder is completely and at 28 % partially . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , there remains entirely only one percent in comparison to the type of diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were compared with the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &quot; in general better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitoring the patient &apos;s blood levels of hem@@ ost@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar level over time . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ ost@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the surgery , the average tick @-@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased level of around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as you reflected in the improved o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - decreased not the mortality in five years , so the guiding researchers Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team demonstrated the average results in the two types of the surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , a greater return operations in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and H@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.@@ 1 % vs. 2 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show survival benefit of the surgery after five years , there are hints from a study of serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people subjected to obesity , approximately 29 per cent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study did not show an advantage for survival in the surgery patient , Black@@ stone said it is re@@ ass@@ uring for individuals with a BM@@ I below 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without the risk of death or a kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone report@@ edly asked that people and their doctors should start weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long before we take people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have planted their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love history plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a subject that is estimated at present in F@@ ic@@ tion : a young woman , to school times un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly , hits the s@@ warm of her youth after years and this love to love her in her . &quot;
&quot; so also in the recently published Roman &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; by Luisa Bin@@ der . &quot;
beyond love story the novel can be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers because it plays in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and the surrounding villages .

&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe could not take up all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and he added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist guide asked to stop violence in the refugees &apos; home countries .
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten days visit in the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford studies dedicated to ethics studies .
he claimed that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries is admir@@ able to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; despite the fact that the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to contem@@ plate on long @-@ term solutions like a real peace and genuine development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries &quot; , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we must think about how the killing in their countries is dimin@@ ished . &quot;
we have to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the September 11 attack on the counter @-@ violent reaction of the US changed a chain of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
&quot; after the 11th September , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and I said to him , the way to resolve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put power and this has brought forth un@@ expected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
quadru@@ ple increase of intake of hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer by children in the past 4 years
&quot; control centers in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years , which swal@@ low weight dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues generated by hand@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , the control centers report , of 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are becoming more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them enter in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
he said that some children would dis@@ su@@ ade dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ine@@ z in social media .
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
young people said to have been dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with alcohol water in order to obtain a tougher drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are par@@ ented .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and oran@@ ges , which are very pleasing for children . &quot;
de@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially with children a few spra@@ yers can already cause the alcohol @-@ poison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ Master &apos;s Centre at the Hospital of K@@ ans@@ as , the sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not let your luck whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants within reach of children , and if children get to it then it is a fast way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently taken four sp@@ lash of straw@@ berry smell dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in school was brought into an emergency treatment . &quot;
&quot; your blood non @-@ concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is considered by adults by law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency medical doctor who treated it in the G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah slept her words , and was unable to go when she came up in the emergency . &quot;
&quot; doctors sc@@ anned them overnight in a separate children &apos;s disease on signs of brain @-@ trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen by alcohol and met her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; that was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah Mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant use and dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant outside the reach of the child .
over alcohol @-@ poison@@ ing were some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants associated with deaths .
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died following the dro@@ ck of slopes that have a toxic , un@@ explained ingredient . &quot;
&quot; employees of health authorities assume that the product meth@@ anol contained , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ anol alcohol , which was noted as substance . &quot;
&quot; in January he planned three students of the fourth class at the State of New York , their &quot; &quot; cra@@ fting a &quot; &quot; teacher to po@@ ison by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , so it announces a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer and ex@@ iles them from their space .
&quot; the police considered the negotiating plan as &quot; &quot; si@@ deline &quot; , &quot; and the disciplinary measures referred to the school body . &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Sch@@ wenn@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; in an ascent on the cross @-@ border between Nor@@ dr@@ ing and upon Her@@ ding , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver has been injured easily at a rear @-@ end . &quot;
&quot; a 60 @-@ year old truck driver went to the cross @-@ border in the direction of the roundabout , and took to late that at the roundabout two most likely vehicles stopped . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , he bla@@ sted with his truck to the rear of an audience and wh@@ om@@ it this vehicle on one before the Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; at the im@@ partial vehicles involved in the interven@@ ing of approximately 10 000 Euro , the police disp@@ els with them . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t think we are feeling under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in a sh@@ ot@@ tic football smo@@ ked down@@ stream - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former nation@@ alists of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch soccer fans have interested in Celtic , there is no title &quot; rival@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic games anymore and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the ranking .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
there is a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m games and there aren &apos;t just the people of Scotland who want to see those games .
I will turn around things sw@@ am di@@ ke di@@ ke .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic has to fight but the Norwegian boss ceas@@ es to turn things around .

&quot; but she said : &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know , it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot;
we feel it exactly like this - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the player better . &quot;
to date together is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK as a whole .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 while the number of people without labor for the United Kingdom was reduced to $ 1.@@ 82 million in the same period as a whole . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent lay above the UK@@ s of 5.5 percent as the figures of the office for National Statisti@@ cs ( ONS ) .
&quot; in the meantime , employment fell to 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the qu@@ artet , the employment rate fell to 7@@ 4.@@ 0 percent - a number above the UK @-@ average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said , &quot; &quot; The long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland has made historic decision to remain part of the UK .

why I will be a Exec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; a little later today , except in a late legal intervention , I will see how a man will be put to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator @-@ gallery in the death chamber in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma state of Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard For@@ sip is ex@@ ited by the poison@@ ing . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day came closer , I began to fear . &quot;
&quot; so , why should I do it ? &quot;
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a great way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see Hin@@ ts in the USA , and since more applicants are often available as platforms , a flaw@@ less lottery takes place in order to decide which is chosen . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma the number of media sites from 12 to five is reduced .
who is selected will be it em@@ otive .
I cannot do that .
&quot; besides Richard glos@@ si@@ ps I will sit , with which I developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two @-@ hour and a half @-@ hour visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so it will not allow me to record a notebook and a pen , to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remind myself of all the details .
a journalist of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma would blame me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot;
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants and you will get access .
I hide me with her .
&quot; she arranged that she &quot; &quot; she could have better form@@ ulate &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong with what I do . &quot;
Richard glos@@ sip had problems with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
&quot; but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present , in order to write there . &quot;
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that the publicity work of the movement against the death penalty will help . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please do not listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have done . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back here again .
I can not say with certainty that Richard glos@@ sip is inno@@ cent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ k would make him guilty of being a benefici@@ ary of fact .
but I believe that a strong likelihood is that he is not guilty of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence . &quot;
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
&quot; I cannot claim , to be really objective . &quot;
there will be other re@@ porters to which you can turn to them .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man an unnecessary death .

&quot; he had rec@@ alled 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage &apos;s accus@@ ations , and did not want it to look like too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about this , and I have been eating for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything goes out again &quot; , &quot; Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it is far @-@ reaching .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I must live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to be s@@ led together , and I want my owners thinking that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; when they start thinking , I do not this , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
I don &apos;t have to consider what I do with my license .
&quot; previously Moo@@ dy had pushed the bomb into an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity of integration had tried to play its stable . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry Hu@@ ley , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name - and offered him employment in my stables , to supply information about what I do in my stalls , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they believe that I am a che@@ at .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly stick to their n@@ oses , because they attempt to believe me , failed . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former president of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , acting President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , up to current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today . &quot;
should I think that it will be personally ?
has the R@@ V@@ L behave and perhaps makes people outside trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I ill for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people think out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they must take my license and have rejected me , and I have no doubt that what I say is asking them about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I have now arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the frustration of the trainers have been assembled with the long @-@ lasting sprit@@ es at Li@@ dar@@ i and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to it that he could throw &quot; his license over the table .
&quot; Moo@@ dy &apos;s best known by his preparation of the un@@ wit@@ ty Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race time &quot; &quot; ridiculous &quot; &quot; after a pack of mud or tone applied to the horse debate , which turned against the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has mistak@@ enly pon@@ der on the leg .
it could have been like this yesterday evening .
it could have been just yesterday the whole day as it was .
but it had also been the day before the race .
Moo@@ dy might be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack of the race day . an examination of this affair has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man for driver @-@ cur@@ sed was arrested

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy hits against ri@@ vals for cont@@ en@@ tions about ring@@ ing for cont@@ en@@ tions
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of the Tac@@ cem@@ ic of his players as &quot; agenda setting &quot; of two Premier League &apos;s favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson told that the refer@@ ee will have allowed the Storm @-@ players &quot; ring battles &quot; with his team at the grand Storm winner in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ co Trainer Way@@ ne Ben@@ nett made a barely covered note to the Storm @-@ Team , after his team had reached the final victory against North Queensland co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland did not &quot; too good &quot; in rings . &quot;
Bell@@ amy defen@@ ders the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his crew and said that she was concentrating only on her &quot; contact . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy , in addition , that the criticism of two leading trainer in his team gave him confident because it means that she was worried that she was worried about the Storm @-@ Team . &quot;
&quot; that turns again and again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring struggles , when she be@@ aten us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ me@@ on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have not changed our defensive system or the techniques for the last six weeks , but in the last six weeks we have produced our contact with Tac@@ kles &quot; , &quot; and that is the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he therefore probably is not used to lose it , so it was a little shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s really strange as this emerges again and again in this season .
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Ben@@ nett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Ben@@ nett was St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; soccer . &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a disc . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting , especially its young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game that you want to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he did this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as this . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger trust because they say these things , because they are a bit worried , to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they did not think of us as it was about Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster achieved a higher result than the game bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is it an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and not points something cl@@ amping ?
for me it is the schedules .
&quot; when they mention , it means that we will meet in a phase still . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team is free this weekend , as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday in the eve final in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . tickets will start the next Tuesday morning . &quot;
Ser@@ bi@@ er with 200,000 $ refundable in the drug @-@ cl@@ age
&quot; a man who may possibly a life @-@ long punishment threatened by his trial , to come into possession of 40 kilograms co@@ ca@@ ine , which were smug@@ gled up to Queensland , was released against a deposit of 200,000 $ . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the U.S. police found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , coming from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and moved in August at Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina in the mid noon and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era road house where the police took 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota visual .
&quot; despite a potentially li@@ felong sentence for attempting to own a commercial lot co@@ ca@@ ine , argued the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café , from a harmless ground could have been . &quot;
&quot; judges at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Stro@@ agan , was worried about the escape from Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot;
in pen@@ al stationary he kept the police on his place of residence .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and step@@ father had a security deposit of 200,000 Dollar as well as security to achieve his release .
&quot; after reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ oc@@ ative statements of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 Dollar was a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge f@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice , to prevent him from falling away , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Ser@@ b Pass , daily in the police and surrendered to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A@@ 5 in Karlsruhe : se@@ wer sett@@ les apart
&quot; at a rear @-@ end case with three trucks on the highway 5 in Karlsruhe , on Tuesday evening a truck driver has been badly hurt . &quot;
two of the three cars involved had slo@@ wed before a permanent place in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver spot@@ ted it too late and tried to so@@ ak , in the last moment to turn to the left , as the police declared . &quot;
the ruler of the accident @-@ induc@@ ed plan completely apart .
the driver was badly injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord has been totally locked about six hours until 2 am .
&quot; there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 Euro . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g used phone of girls to enti@@ ce ped@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
&quot; a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 year old girl , to challenge images of child abuse . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g took the phone of the girl , when this slept , he logged into an online mess@@ aging service by which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children that were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sle@@ y Ho@@ g@@ g .
she saw it through her the confusing messages and aler@@ ted immediately found her mother .
&quot; the police took care about it and saw the five pictures , analysed that computers found under the address and discovered the &quot; &quot; web research &quot; &quot; concepts for the search of un@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ g@@ g said to the officers that he did it , since it was done to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet &quot; and he then &quot; was , a poli@@ cem@@ an to be frightened . &quot;
&quot; the prosecution of E@@ ili@@ dh Rober@@ t@@ son said the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said , it would be a addiction that he is addic@@ tive to sc@@ are people . &quot;
&quot; he gave that seeking on the computer was conducted by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a poli@@ cem@@ an to intimi@@ date a poli@@ ophi@@ le . &quot;
he was asked about his discussions with the un@@ familiar person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send more photos .
he said that he did it to enti@@ ce them .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said , He would then see images of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was sitting at the tre@@ mb@@ ling and crying . &quot;
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the telephone and made the accused .
&quot; the girl was interviewed and told , that the accused computer and Play@@ station was using to speak with girls who saw much younger than him . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ g@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , ple@@ aded guilty to the proclamation of the indictment , to have declared un@@ decent images of children on 14 June this year , to have appeared before judgment on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ g@@ g is not published in the register of sexual criminal offen@@ ders , as one argue that &quot; no substantial &quot; sexual element &quot; must be found in his understanding . &quot;
sh@@ eri@@ ff Al@@ ist@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael suggest to be the verdict of October to receive background reports on social labor .
Ho@@ g@@ g was charged in this case but was held in custody for hear@@ ings to others still in custody .
he was added before the date of urine in the list of sexual criminal offen@@ ders .
smug@@ user brow@@ ses on small border inter@@ connects to Germany
more and more refugees are brought up from the main control points at the Franco @-@ Austrian border .
many tu@@ ally purchased from fear of discovery and capture people in smaller border crossing
&quot; out on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man said of the Federal Police . &quot;
&quot; along the border of the Rhine o , more than 1,000 refugees have been picked up in the county roads of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn . &quot;
it was possible to walk over bridges and dust @-@ pipes on the German side .
they are then collected by Bundes@@ Police in reception and forwarded to the registration .
at the Munich central railway station we made a lot more refugees following the course of the police station at the course of the weekend on Wednesday .
&quot; after 8.00 am , some 700 people were arrived in the provincial capital , said a spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot;
&quot; following the re @-@ establishment of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , the city had reached the city on Tuesday 17@@ 59 . &quot;
Stuttgart : off@@ sho@@ ots of Tro@@ pen@@ ess &quot; Henry &quot; in the South @-@ West expected
mete@@ or@@ ists warn of a storm in the South @-@ West of Wednesday morning .
&quot; due to a low pressure area above Western European rivers , hot sea air currently atten@@ ed in the country , the German weather service ( Deutscher Wetter@@ dienst , DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the vigor@@ ous twe@@ eter is the footh@@ ills of the &quot; &quot; tro@@ op &quot; &quot; Henry , that in the past few days were pulled out of the Atlantic Ocean during the past few days . &quot;
fierce storms and storms are mainly expected in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , until Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Schwä@@ b@@ ang Al@@ b and at the Spre@@ ader circuit , with bucks in 60 to 90 kilometers per hour . &quot;
the sun was therefore no longer able to look ahead .
the crowd make it : every two years the car@@ makers on the IA@@ A show their novel@@ ties .
2015 is mainly noticeable in the comp@@ action passages that are currently especially well sold .
cars from the compact class are currently highly requested : approximately 28 @-@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were rel@@ ayed after a multi @-@ motor ( KBA ) alone in August on this segment .
this is also reflected on the IA@@ A ( Revelation 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; this year , the futur@@ istic concept autom@@ obil@@ es and new luxury cars will be featured in this year especially many new compact models . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest Premi@@ ers for the German auto industry is the Opel A@@ stra , which is open to de@@ aler@@ ships in autumn . &quot;
&quot; A@@ stra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel @-@ Thomas Neumann CEO at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume of the volume , the new A@@ stra has not to become much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel is launching an entry below the largest competitor of VW Golf in view , which is at 5@@ 650 Euro . &quot;
the current A@@ stra costs from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the A@@ stra has a new 1,4 @-@ lit@@ re engine with 74 kW / 100 HP .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 b@@ hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder petrol engine . &quot;
other than the main competitor of VW Golf and Ford Focus there is the Opel A@@ stra first only as a fifth .
&quot; as a second variant , I will follow in the spring of the wagon , which is also already visible at the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what is next to the A@@ stra on the IA@@ A nor for new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sent the fourth generation of its A@@ stra rival Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively as a five @-@ fifth in a conventional and one dedicated to see the sporting GT version .
in the trade he comes at the beginning of next year as well as a wagon .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan Alliance wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; in this way , the compact Infin@@ iti fits with its curved lines fully into the design line of the brand . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 HP .
but there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 HP or 125 kW / 170 HP .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno that celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1,@@ 0 @-@ liter tur@@ bom@@ bed and an output of 82 kW / 111 HP . &quot;
the maximum torque is based according to 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe will be launched in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not quite new , but completely re@@ done is the compact model DS 4 , which is seen at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; from the outside , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger especially laid hands on the front part : the cooler star was re@@ marked and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment@@ system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by touch@@ screen and is first integrated into Apple &apos;s Car@@ play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the IA@@ A in the comp@@ ac@@ tal class a series of over@@ work and new variants are like the &quot; &quot; Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot drop @-@ line &quot; . &quot; &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cells are un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ in@@ mate to the J@@ ail of J@@ ail , having spent months in a small cell . &quot;
&quot; because of the breach of its human dignity , in@@ mates are fundamentally entitled to financial compensation , as they are contained in small cells . &quot;
this is what the Federal Constitutional Court has decided in a vote on Wednesday .
sufferers may even hope the judge for the judges even if they were locked up only a few days in the narrow spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
&quot; with this , an explosion of in@@ mate has been successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : it was contained in the Berlin @-@ Court of Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separate . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who is now again placed himself on the free foot of his lawyer . meanwhile , a larger cell had been moved . &quot;
his minister@@ ial cl@@ age because of the un@@ worthy arrest warrant against the Land of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the constitutional referendum raised the judgment of the Court of cham@@ ber@@ ing in Berlin and rejected the case for renewed exam . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber Court will now decide on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons of the questionable period just a few days of ha@@ ab@@ age are decisive for compensation , be an equal measure , it was meant . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; a cr@@ ush would be afraid of the cause of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber Court must now clarify the amount of payments .
in the past the constitutional bodies have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
&quot; so they spoke only in April of an in@@ mate strike , because he was not locked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 , according to a choice of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday also the Berlin constitutional Court , who found a prisoner , in a parallel fall in November 2009 had an in@@ decent accommodation . &quot;
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had been placed daily between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar case in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin prisons were also coming to the head@@ lines in recent weeks due to missing personnel .
&quot; prisoners are therefore always including 23 hours including aggres@@ si@@ vity , even to bat , it should be already due to the tense situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the legal press@@ status , 21 places in te@@ as@@ parag@@ us are not occupied for young workers , 19 February 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept it .
what is coming to Germany ?
&quot; approximately 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany with forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Federal Affairs this year , according to the statement of vice chan@@ cell@@ or Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to resume a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge determination : &quot; I say again and again : we can create this and we create it .
what gives on to Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to different forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Education ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institut ) apartments annually - and the next five years . &quot;
it is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; however , the lack of living space is dramatic but above all on affordable rental objects : each year 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 welfare apartments come out of rent prices , and in order to apply these particularly favourable apartments will also apply for refugees . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Federal Minister of Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute : 80 000 social housing in the country would have to be created , and the federal government should have invested € 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; in agreement , scientists and federal ministries agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing . &quot;
&quot; according to the Institute of Labour Market and Research Institute , it is estimated that 55 percent of the refugee population may be ann@@ er@@ ated in Germany in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically for their qualifications to help them get started by Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial if they find employment in Germany .
&quot; work is the key for social contacts , for appreciation in the youth society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the im@@ migrant , says migr@@ atory researchers Diet@@ rich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , it has been a political turning point : from work ban for refugees to recognise labour . &quot;
&quot; while a working ban for asylum seekers from up to five years ago , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence compulsory , the asylum seekers on a residential location . &quot;
&quot; in society - also because of the lack of qualified labour , it is also the point of view that refugees should be allowed to gain access to the labour market faster . &quot;
a major barrier to access the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
&quot; until now , there is not yet an extensive range of general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
the structure of networks is therefore according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt from the Royal Road to Work En@@ re@@ integration .
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugees admit their children to the Kit@@ ash , estimated at ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the pro@@ mul@@ gated parents it is only quite important to hold the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ yp@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Chancell@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , distribute the administration of hand@@ outs in different languages . &quot;
&quot; should the need for educ@@ ators increase strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would attempt to increase the training capacity - e.g. by allowing more specialized schools . &quot;
&quot; in those countries , students will be prepared without a German knowledge of welcome classes in the lessons . &quot;
&quot; they are not always taught by trained teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate St@@ ations , from Berlin &apos;s school administration . &quot;
the German Student@@ en@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no Bundes@@ land asylum seekers or commem@@ oration of the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , Ex@@ sen@@ ator Frank Hen@@ kel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his stance . &quot;
studio @-@ willing refugees could be facilitated by the university &apos;s access to the university .
&quot; for refugees with a break @-@ by or debt cancellation do not receive any achievements in the asylum seekers of asylum , if they begin studying . &quot;
the latter is basically not a BA@@ Fö@@ G because it does not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ici@@ ans .
&quot; toler@@ ated refugees have had to have lived in Germany four years before , to be eligible for BA@@ Fö@@ G , from 1 January 2016 to shor@@ tens this cl@@ utter to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but also these mort@@ gage resources must be closed , ask for Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Under@@ secretary for Science , and the German Student@@ en@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; Islam will in future play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should in@@ sti@@ gated the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and to further develop the existing state of churches to a new state of religions . &quot;
&quot; it would also be important to establish a Islamic welfare association , who takes care of the new arrivals . &quot;
the rights include also duties .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and give up certain possibilities for control with the state in many areas . &quot;
it is also a willingness to heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced the concern of religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to fight such conflicts in Germany are instantly their right to stay here , in Germany , in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said at Bay@@ rische ischer Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he proposed the Basic Law to translate into Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be a topic of the whole society even more today . &quot;
&quot; this will also have to change the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and racism will be more pressing . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - have been an anti @-@ discrimination organisation since a short decade and a gender equality law .
&quot; but it was very slow to learn how the NS@@ U series showed , in the police and authorities to systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what Migr@@ ant organizations and the non @-@ white German employers already call for long and why international agreements , such as anti@@ rac@@ ism Convention , must become a reality in the years to come into peace and use its new citizens - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; generally speaking , Germany is able to provide medical @-@ to @-@ date refugees , as well as medical President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; what affects Man@@ - Power and capacities , we manage that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money would be necessary to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery is calling for all of the arrivals right to the registration of health cards . &quot;
&quot; earnings could be rep@@ uted , later with the Bundes@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly questionable , so many people with the restricted performance catalogue and I anticipate the asylum seekers of asylum . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors are preparing to create the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; previously , the Berlin Health Sciences The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven to be worse off their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , even in healthcare practices , the interpre@@ ter would have to be taken care of , she calls for . &quot;
&quot; for many refugees , many refugees would also have been helped with more general medical ethics in the emergency . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; under refugee camps , about there are much more untreated disabilities , and among the young people go about HIV @-@ enlightenment . &quot;
&quot; with the partially other disease models , German doctors said of their training but become clear , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery stands . &quot;
&quot; the parasi@@ tism or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so hard to see . and what affects the doctors , be even allevi@@ ating in sight by the refugees . &quot;
the Syrians have had a highly developed education system ; several refugees were even doctors .
&quot; however , in order to be able to live , they would have to show their qualifications and take them out scrut@@ ini@@ zed scrut@@ iny . &quot;
at least half of the refugees coming in Germany is psych@@ ologically ill for the estimates of the law@@ suit ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ologically ill : most suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorders or in depression .
&quot; vulnerable the refugee @-@ sk@@ in@@ der , Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
&quot; a recently published study by the Technical University Munich , that every fifth Syrian refugee transfer , traumati@@ zed in Germany . &quot;
&quot; who is suffering from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorders , suffers from other things in the so @-@ called flas@@ h@@ backs with respir@@ ation , di@@ zz@@ iness , p@@ airing and death p@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms are sleeping , and concentration in trouble , a strong shock and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms would be chronic , be an early treatment necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; up to now , however , only four percent of psych@@ ic @-@ sick refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; though , psych@@ ologically ill @-@ seekers can ask for asylum seekers in the social cases an application for psych@@ otherapy , but this process usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social cases , most of the workers or doctors , who are not educated to the psychological disorders , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this is often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites for dreams
with the new staging &quot; passion &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst takes back the traditions of cir@@ c@@ uses .
&quot; the goal is to draw every age group into the construction of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal @-@ dres@@ sings and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the man@@ ege on the brick water he@@ els for day@@ dre@@ aming .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine without living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ rah , and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ in . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current management of management .
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus is living in the hands of the Pro@@ bst .
the gift to am@@ a@@ ze the family is in the blood .
&quot; it is important to us to take away the people from their everyday lives and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; says the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior athletes . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ ze cocktail with a world @-@ city flair , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst looks at his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometres long tour can enjoy this flair .
the programme of the cir@@ cus is convincing by talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v Clo@@ wn Family wins the public with wit and charm in her spell . &quot;
also the Castillo Brothers understand their craft .
with the heroes of the St@@ um@@ m@@ movies I want to contact the Cub@@ an duo .
ligh@@ tness and flexibility - they identify with these words .
your hum@@ orous art on the mast is to conquer women &apos;s heart in the storm .
except through numerous salmon farms the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst looks also with finger@@ tips and joint consistency .

Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of the ac@@ rob@@ atics such as little others and fascinated with their flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brig@@ itte . &quot;
abnorm@@ alities in the attitudes of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst takes a stand , &quot; &quot; it is not good for our animals , it also does not go well . &quot;
some 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every mat@@ ing unit .
&quot; the four @-@ legged g@@ ust &apos; , as they are lovingly called , will be read by the eyes according to the possibility of every wish . &quot;
we want to work together with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to put it into the ring . &quot;
the top commandment thus : good for the animals care .
&quot; especially on their z@@ eb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a z@@ eb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family is very proud . &quot;
the two animals have lived in a c@@ ages for eight years and nothing has happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , told Brig@@ itte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; z@@ eb@@ roid is not ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus . &quot;
for each visitor there should be something for everyone .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , &quot; no matter whether five or a 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all the heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 and 20 o &apos;clock to his ideas .
the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. on Sunday .
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are discounted . &quot;

Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guides , dropped down from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread quickly through the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by asser@@ tions of members of the opposition , that they would have received anonymous death threats and had warned that they were warned by Mr Mu@@ gabe by Mr Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; in the past month they had booked it , and interrupted by his speech to the State of the State in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man for movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven op@@ positions @-@ politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones , which they warned against Mr. Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he told the journalists after Mu@@ gabe speech . &quot;
&quot; they warned EU members affected by the Parliament , and as soon as they leave parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
the spokes@@ man said that Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i @-@ led party was &quot; concerned about the dangers for politicians .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will operate up to 30,000 jobs
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to be 25.000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts at the company &apos;s services .
HP will later split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
expected job @-@ building leads to a load of more than 2.@@ 7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter of the year said HP Velotechnik in an explanation .
&quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise Edition , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair and Chief Executive , which shall lead the unity after separation . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is managed to be smaller and more focused than its HP today , and we have a broad and diversified portfolio of shops that businesses can help transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual 2012 revenue and &quot; &quot; will be focused on delivering integrated , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; so an explanation of the company . &quot;
&quot; it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930@@ s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electric plants and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birthplace of the Silicon Valley . &quot; &quot;
HP has made a massive restructuring to master the move from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area , based on belief that closely focused companies perform better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates at the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere must stand
&quot; Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised towards Wil@@ sh@@ ere that he is only September and where his rehabilitation is going according to plan , there is no reason why he could not play before Christmas again . &quot;
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in light of its history his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
&quot; the great shame on this issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended last season after a separate kno@@ b , and then returned to its old momentum during the pre @-@ season . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury does not threat the career , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
it is a bone that is not well healed .
it is not a major matter .
this was only an accident .
it was not in connection with his kno@@ b or with the wounds which he had previously had .
&quot; this may be true from purely medical perspective , but like Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , always when a player attempts to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also evol@@ ves an uncomfortable pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd had 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago .
he also played in the age of 65 of Arsen@@ als 7@@ 157 Lig@@ asp@@ ed in the last five seasons .
&quot; the wider picture of arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight game periods since 2007 / 08 , most of the vulner@@ ability stage . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the risk of injuries will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a blank time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain momentum , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he ear@@ ns . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al starts its Champions League in front of the game against Din@@ amo Zagreb prior to the game against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham hot@@ track next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger is a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelling to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Post@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players that need it to give a little break @-@ up , &quot; &quot; said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal &apos;s clear favour@@ ites , through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the playing fields with the largest intimi@@ dation in Europe . &quot;
dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign in the last season has been started .
&quot; the stadium was shaken on Tuesday evening by a earthquake , while on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 were measured . &quot;
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League &apos;s capit@@ ulation against Monaco and will be driven by far more hope , with its management to lead the club to his first European stage of Europe . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; he said . &quot;
arsen@@ al has never folded .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not a dre@@ amer . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that gave us serious lessons by men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now even more des@@ perate than ever before , as self @-@ rulers among young men on a 15 @-@ year count . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important death trial in men at age 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains more common in men than in women . &quot;
&quot; on an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ es ( CAL@@ M - campaign against a miserable life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to question if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to address this challenge .
&quot; a recent study on more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms demonstrated that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with a healthy atmosphere , &quot; his chances on recovery has doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of mental healthy friends the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends again so that a friendship can work .
&quot; in the age of more than social media , communication with its focus on style about substance is often more important to im@@ it@@ ability of the answer than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have the need to appear strong , viable and successful , even though in reality the insulation is dominated . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call extr@@ ins@@ ic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much more profound . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated , money cannot really buy luck . &quot;
&quot; the beautiful on Friends , was that this focuss@@ ing on the head was placed . &quot;
&quot; every character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which shines through the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments in football , and a longing for Ross nach Rachel - all of this came out of the knowledge that men can definitely be able to contem@@ plate completely their feelings . &quot;
&quot; how an employee of phone care said to me : ... &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and com@@ promised , has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to talk with friends .
&quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; Come with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks about problems openly . &quot;
&quot; Friends is one of the shows that come to mind , when I try to offer long @-@ term accounting mechanisms . &quot;
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my object @-@ attractive out@@ sider status about the phone will help people in eye view of despair , the long @-@ term assistance comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , when you visit this weekend of edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest when you visit the celebration of the day totally renovated scenery , why do not take your friends to have a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , if you want to sit around in Star@@ bucks someone alone , give it a smile and tell you Hello . &quot;
you never know what the difference could make your friendship .
&quot; friends will be sent at Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes , for the # Friend@@ s@@ Fest &quot;
&quot; di Santa meets to help PS@@ G , Malmö to crus@@ hed &quot;
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ fi@@ i and m@@ son CA@@ ani after his hits against Malmö .
&quot; di Santa meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to migrate to Malmö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
&quot; Angel Di Maria and Min@@ son CA@@ ani , when Paris Saint @-@ Germain his Champions League season started with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ ciples of the Prin@@ ciples on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after starting his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the path , but afterwards she missed a number of opportunities before they finally had a head of Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k , the group A needs a strong start against the Swedish masters , since they seek not only the qualification for the N.@@ C.@@ -@@ rounds , but an improvement on the path to the quarter @-@ final in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but as they got the points , there was no swe@@ ar of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic@@ s missed opportunity in front of the gate . he was later in the game against his hometown of hometown and against the association with which he began his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to gain , our opponents &apos; problems cause and relaxed , even if there are certain things that we need to perf@@ ecting in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we have won , although I regret having achieved one or two other gates . &quot;
&quot; Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which was able to hold a 2 : 2 draw on their own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was replaced by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine wing service was called the man to take the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he had gone into the Manchester United in the last month before he joined Johan Wil@@ der and finished nicely into the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , someone believed that PS@@ G would win a great victory , which was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö found the Celtic in a play @-@ off paved to reach this level , joined by An@@ pi@@ ff with nine nation @-@ players on the field and was a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle ground up a heavy opponent . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tr@@ active P@@ fo@@ sten at the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , PS@@ G was sometimes given up , with some mis@@ calculations and bad degrees , not least from Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , not least from Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was abandoned after not less than five attempts alone in the first half of p@@ atz@@ bu@@ vic and then after Cav@@ ani had used it after gradu@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he pointed much more skill if he brought his fellow te@@ amm@@ ers into the game , and it was a pass of Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , which turned into a turning gar@@ ment by Wil@@ derness in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole of her ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark , thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay he scored for his 6th Se@@ as@@ ons after I@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; that ended all the thoughts that Malmö found in the game , and just an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the end result could hold low before substitute players Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi has been detected as a gateway at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ c , gave later that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; our last champi@@ ons game was last year in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we only played in the Swedish league that did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification games are not sufficient . &quot;
hut in front of Paris !
it was a great game from them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport club in Qatar for summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern stood a few years ago shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ avi , who at that time played for the FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times of Spanish Master , three times champion , three times champion league tournament , two times champion champion , two times champion , one time champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning . &quot;
in summer the meanwhile 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and turned to al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now betra@@ ys that he was already standing before the 2008 departure at departure from Barcelona . &quot;
she said to me that Bar@@ ça do not want to sell me .
&quot; Madrid won at that time everything , we told nothing &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot;
and the helpful also of FC Bayern .

Matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in the movie theater
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown while discussing the diversity and said they &apos;re not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , as this emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives , stres@@ sing in relation to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the selected script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , do it with the occupation of the film and not by filling the show &quot; , &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; Brown re@@ treats , with bel@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; hoo ! wow . okay , &quot; than the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown made the manufacture of Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss about the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to call people to think about it - who will always be the director - how to treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; Brown said first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a gro@@ ove , that is be@@ aten up by her white sugar . &quot;
the producer of De@@ ar White People put himself up for the Fin@@ alist Leo Angel@@ os and Kr@@ isten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direction of directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on ref@@ utes that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something what we do not want .
&quot; after the discussion has been broadcast , the social media has triumph@@ ed over Dam@@ on comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter &apos;s Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger on the clip expressing his anger , Matt Dam@@ on speaks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - this is SO @-@ KNOW that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et earned over 5,000 Ret@@ re@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on comments will come at a time , at which the media representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion . &quot;
&quot; after the teenage Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the movement of Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved over@@ effects , and urged law@@ makers and authorities to discrimin@@ ate discrimin@@ ate practices against restrictions . &quot;

&apos;@@ American Ninja Warri@@ or &apos;s World Champion
&quot; professional athle@@ tic and operating assistant Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first athle@@ te , who had won the American nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of 1 million persons home . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which had just graduated her 7th season , had never seen a competition participant , which was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season , two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
&quot; for the last task , the clim@@ bers was one of the 75 feet long climbing @-@ rope in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten ended the task in time , with which he finished the first athle@@ te , which ended the exhau@@ sting Phase 4 of American nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended up full three seconds quicker , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock about winning the Big Prize of 1 Million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10.000 $ or my life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap money . &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t imagine how it is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the guiding producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood porter to discuss the Final and why Brit@@ ten , although he was first at all finishing the circuit , does not get any prize money . &quot;
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and changed life ; he receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t believe he &apos;s going to have any penny .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he received the masses of awards he received from fans .
he is such a great guy and a father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I was be@@ aten by someone , then I am happy that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
&quot; and I think that Isaac would have felt , if they had exchanged the roles . &quot;
America Ninja Warri@@ or was extended for an eighth season and the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers pass by Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ W@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; in the past they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League of Central . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as a spo@@ iler , but this part also played perfect against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target Field . &quot;
&quot; the twins donated a chance to climb within a season of Houston , Ast@@ ros for the second American League game . &quot;
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to hold over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Ex@@ m . &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held his early offensive support as Detroit achieved three times in the first two inner @-@ ings then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
&quot; Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times in the 1 / 3 interior , and allowed three to us . &quot;
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I will end this year strongly , &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to throw each game in the bull@@ seye , and so I want to concentrate fully in the game . &quot;
&quot; the nom@@ inee tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three results and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ B@@ Is since the middle of August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since then he had four hits against the Seattle Mar@@ ker on July 6 . &quot;
&quot; he has shocked the drums well , &quot; said Shi@@ m . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the beating training session which saw much better off the bull@@ seye , and he carried it straight into the game . &quot;
with three R@@ uns in the but@@ t at the end of the seventh month the twins had its best chance to get back to the game .
center Fiel@@ d@@ Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; Right @-@ of Aaron hi@@ cks reached a B@@ unt , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ ner Brian Do@@ yle to Stri@@ ke@@ out , before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ de Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran the Wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , ahead of the nom@@ inee R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who entr@@ en@@ ched a Two @-@ Run by the right @-@ handed ring . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the gradu@@ ation run in the second , shipped ha@@ ges to the third Bas@@ que Tre@@ vor lo@@ osen for a double play . &quot;
&quot; it was this in the major league for the 27th time this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ghs struck a double play &quot;
&quot; after Detroit added an Insurance Run at the end of the ninth @-@ session , the wall made a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and recorded the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ handed was made by S@@ ano at three pitch for its fifth release . &quot;
Detroit prof@@ ited to the start of the game from an even non @-@ movable Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers obtained three R@@ us in the first two inner days against the right @-@ handed people , who had been rep@@ ain@@ ted prior to the game by the hurt list , after having been missing more than a month because of a back pain . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning which I wished for , &quot; said Mr Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt comfortable when I slept and feel that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches out in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter in the first , Hus@@ band gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z put Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z in the game that managed a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed its 0 @-@ 21 track series with the Run@@ ning in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third b@@ ner Nick Castell@@ ano followed with a single on the right , managed to run another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers placed on the second being posted an One @-@ Out Double from Cat@@ cher James McC@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ d@@ Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he was not very well be@@ aten , but he caught the right spot . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was located in a Pit@@ ch Count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the rel@@ ie@@ ver right @-@ handed sc@@ um . &quot;
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , it came to three R@@ us at six hits and a walk with four kn@@ itting outs . &quot;
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal S@@ án@@ chez exp@@ ired because of a breach of the wor@@ ship@@ pers .
&quot; he is operated by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ chez in 2007 . &quot;

hundreds of refugees should be signed in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden in Wiesbaden , as the City of Wiesbaden , on the evening of Tuesday . &quot;
it was calculated with 450 to 750 scheduled refugees .
several sports halls of the h@@ ess@@ an state capital were prepared for that fall over the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can be registered temporarily .
it is then to be further distributed to other municipalities .
alone in the past ten days according to the clear@@ ance by the German Chancellor S@@ ießen 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse have already arrived in the past ten days .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up facilities for the large numbers of refugees in sports halls .
Ischgl : German military measures in Syria
&quot; the manager of Munich &apos;s Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for an opportunity . &quot;
&quot; I believe that the decisive rep@@ ent of military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he dra@@ fted the European states &quot; collective . &quot;
four years ago one had been glad that the cup of military participation is passing by Germany .
&quot; now the conflict ends on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; he said in Deutsch@@ land@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid to refugees .
Austria controls southern and Eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria has also introduced its border controls on its southern and Eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Secretary of Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station OR@@ F , after Hungary no one will be returned . &quot;
also Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , that was so agreed , &quot; she declared . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement that Germany could absorb a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , it already gave such talks between the Director General for Public Safety and Government of Germany . &quot;
concrete numbers did not call them and referred to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
during the past few days tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria on the so @-@ called Bal@@ route from Hungary to Austria .
your destination is mostly Germany .
the chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
so far the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common action in the crisis .
the EU Minister of Interior want to take place on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting for the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees .
&quot; given the strong exchange of refugees in Germany , the federal government wants to support the federal state and the distribution of people more strongly . &quot;
&quot; the agreement will show that together with the countries , Merkel announced at the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour discussion with the Prime Minister of the chan@@ cell@@ or in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ score , for those people who need protection , they came this too . &quot;
but who does not have a lead @-@ perspective cannot remain in Germany either .
this idea was quite impressive in the lap .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now master a &quot; huge power of force . &quot;
thousands of doub@@ ted refugees are now stuck on the can@@ on@@ route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres of Serbia at night for Tuesday to Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced the border to Romania including the border to Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary wants to prevent the tu@@ gs that sought out over Romania , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to said to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
there was first ar@@ rests of men who had per@@ ished the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , meanwhile , thousands of migrants reported on their way to the Greek border . &quot;
spac@@ es@@ de &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds the ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
&quot; under the em@@ isp@@ anic of the Satur@@ n@@ mon@@ ds , En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us oscill@@ ates a global ocean . &quot;
these researchers conclude from observations of the fighters &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the moon is easily tum@@ ble on its orbit around the ring . &quot;
&quot; this pi@@ voting movement is only small , but still too big for a solid base of cel@@ estial bodies , it is said to be in the communication of the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US @-@ State New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers show their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; journal .
&quot; it was already longer known , that it must be under the ice blan@@ ket of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us liquid water . &quot;
&quot; so , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had discovered a vul@@ can@@ es on the south @-@ pole of Satur@@ day@@ light , the water vap@@ or and ice particles sp@@ ies and thus feeding the so @-@ called e @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot;
at least at the south @-@ pole there must be a sub@@ terranean sea closed the astronom@@ ers then .
the extent of the hidden ocean was not clarified .

Rome is now a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther square
almost 500 years after the Reformation in Rome there is now a Martin Lu@@ ther square .
&quot; in the presence of city President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino in the name of the town of Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino on Wednesday , a previously named square was bapti@@ sed in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on the name of the German Reform@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the naming was requested by the working group of the evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded the Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could live above centuries as a minority often only in conce@@ al@@ ment of their faith . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , the name of the Christian faith in Rome will be welcome . &quot;
Martin Lu@@ ther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) turned out to be a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the annual sol@@ sti@@ ce 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he found the city at that time as a troubled burden .
his negative impressions are likely to strengthen him according to historians in his future fight against Rome .
Lu@@ ther had then initiated with his thes@@ es against the sec@@ ession of the division of the Norwegian Church .
hammer artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; Jesus with the ( gol@@ d@@ ded ) Dor@@ nen@@ cro@@ one is one of the main works , which has painted Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible . &quot;
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has written the introduction and updated the Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not by the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now published with gorgeous paintings . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning was the picture of Ot@@ mar Alt , who had formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms got the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which however is not at all equally important with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; contrary : according to the respective subjects , it can act quite dark . &quot;
&quot; approximately three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked in his Bible @-@ Project , for which he met a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of the book &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these cycles have emerged cycles , which dedic@@ ate topics like crosses , pl@@ agues , commandments or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
thus it has been intrigu@@ ed as several partners : this applies to the Lu@@ ther publisher with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and above all the author Klaus Al@@ te@@ post set himself on the basis of painting with the respective scriptures .
&quot; he interpreted the Bible from Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ selected Bible , and thus translated into current contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; embedded between the original Bible College of Martin Lu@@ ther and a set of the artist , who wrote his very personal thoughts about each situation here . &quot;
the jewelry band has Golden Let@@ ters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a great deal of intimacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode was born and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant domin@@ at@@ age order . &quot;
&quot; that the education was already with the cane stock , &quot; Oth@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work up , in order to be able to forgive me again also with the Lord father . &quot;
his second concern is to be more important in art in a faster time : &quot; the perception of images is co@@ ined by advertising and which is loud .
symbol@@ ism is there being displaced .
artists have a different desire and glad@@ ness to show things .
pictures always have some secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewers take into the pictures &quot; &quot; taken into the images &quot; , &quot; let them explore , discover and sense what strength they have : &quot; &quot; the picture looks for his counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Al@@ te@@ post @-@ on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; had always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ t Art &quot; , &quot; I like he fully compre@@ h@@ ends with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I have not paid heed to capture the Bible for all , but that for him important , also mysterious topics . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; &quot; this is about the pictures , the text is merely &quot; &quot; written be a paintings &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Lu@@ ther &apos;s Verlag , this work is an invitation to del@@ ve his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ t &apos;s paintings speak both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as that of responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - pap@@ er- and fla@@ x frames - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on 15 November at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Foundation . &quot;
construction project for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn -
&quot; plans made , place found to mod@@ eled on Earth for a circuit : one year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was already the end . &quot;
&quot; om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration made for transit , especially among the residents who did not tolerate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so hill was looking upwards , new space sought - well with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the approval will enter in October , could tell the First Joint Council Sabine Mo@@ se@@ bach @-@ Bo@@ ck now in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year is still going to be visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
it should then be started without &quot; further commem@@ oration with the works of the former warehouse .
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees to 2019 , and the Bundesliga team is committed to a clear sign in the weekend . &quot;
the football reacted to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and ass@@ ures the policy its help in tackling the upcoming problems .
&quot; I have been this for the greatest challenge of our country since Re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; in principle no one can say , this is nothing about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be interested in every single interest to get this issue in the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B , CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany at the Annual Meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin .
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the chan@@ cell@@ or and tre@@ ach there the state Minister , Mrs G@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; since then , the issue will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could help and wants to help .
but the decisive course needs to place politics .
this is why the German football alliance has extended its wave @-@ initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Juli@@ an@@ s / Malta . &quot;
also some federal states support this program .
already this weekend the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ bran@@ ching are showing a clear sign when they are on the left jer@@ king bee instead of the usual Sponsor@@ ship logos ( Her@@ mes ) the imprint &quot; We help - # Al@@ es@@ welcome . &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sport@@ di Fi@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; Photo &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ suffici@@ ency . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee @-@ drama is at all , nobody is allowed to see . &quot;
&quot; we can use soccer team , no , we must use our beam , our influence and our possibilities for the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
&quot; H@@ offen@@ se , Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent symbol of the League . &quot;
&quot; to the EM @-@ qualification game against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as a &quot; great common plant of German football . &quot;
&quot; that all 36 licensing agreements could have started in their own locations , be great . &quot;
&quot; just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we have spent , is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; it is of enormous significance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association aims to provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees in each case with the DF@@ B selection and the German government . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have also called off the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported . &quot;

Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could however pursue his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the meeting in Wall@@ dorf &quot; , &quot; said Plat@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 year old manager was at the meeting and &quot; fully working @-@ fit &quot; during the meeting .
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; on Thursday , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software . &quot;
&quot; I am full of SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman H@@ asso Plat@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer it was no longer in the German SAP Head@@ quarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , &quot; said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; anyone can happen . &quot;
&quot; it is important to be re@@ plen@@ ish , when you please . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen besides the skir@@ mish ...
&quot; Magn@@ us@@ sen we@@ ather@@ ed an appropriate photo and explained , he suffered the injury , when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel . &quot;
&quot; consequently , arriving in Singapore in the weekend it comes as little as a reserve for the two ordinary drivers of Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and Jen@@ son Button in@@ quired how a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : past@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes for com@@ eback from Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League finally struck . &quot;
the national player becomes the leader of the soccer league the soccer league also in the du@@ el with the FR@@ P Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 h / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot rely on him unfortunately , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel the Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether rec@@ alling on Sunday in the Bundesliga team against Le@@ verk@@ usen will be over again , let the BV@@ B coach is open : &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of his professional , Tu@@ chel will change its stem eleven as only on the rec@@ us position . &quot;
thus it announced a change on the g@@ acy position .
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the position of Chief Apostle Roman Bür@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he co@@ ached on an absolute top @-@ level , &quot; praised the football team the world champion . &quot;
&quot; whether past@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the future comes to be used in all European league games , but Tu@@ chel has to be open . &quot;
&quot; with high probability , he will also share the second game . &quot;
&quot; the formal statement by fellow @-@ players Re@@ us that the Fin@@ alist campaign for BV@@ B in the European League has its aim , holds the mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for understandable : &quot; &quot; Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants to lead the pioneer for Germany
&quot; according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany shall be fron@@ trun@@ ner in the change of the German government at the time of the German government . &quot;
&quot; the Cab@@ inet was decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; at the edge of the Autom@@ ne IA@@ A , Do@@ do spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt am the br@@ esse of a &quot; new mobility age . &quot; &quot;
&quot; automated , connected driving will increase the road safety and ensure less electricity , &quot; &quot; g@@ ain@@ dt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 States which will also meet with representatives of the industry at the IA@@ A .
the strategy paper of the traffic Department stresses the importance of mobile broad@@ band design and low prices on digital radio .
the testing of new technology is currently producing a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; with that the driver &quot; &quot; fails to check additional liability risks &quot; , &quot; the German government wants to review the legal framework &quot; and , &quot; where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for instance , Germany wants to employ around an internationally that the permitted maximum speed for the self @-@ prop@@ elled cars of 10 to 130 km @-@ kilometres are raised . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the federal government wants to stand up for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only fores@@ ees the people as a driver . &quot;
&quot; when automated driving takes over , the car gets the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
&quot; the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras , which collect the environment and process the data in seconds . &quot;
&quot; according to a study submitted by the Economy Ministry , it will be technically possible to drive highly automated driving on motor@@ ways up to 2020 . &quot;
&quot; while passenger cars were waiting to be expected on public roads &quot; &quot; only far to 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving force at the site in Germany , the authors of the study value for 20@@ 25 to approximately 8.@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital connectivity of the system can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD @-@ commerce S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of the driver must be clearly defined . &quot;
but the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are quite skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the For@@ sa institute , at the behalf of the investig@@ ator The@@ DE@@ K@@ RA , comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that the cars will compete in the coming ten years , and 31 percent only do not believe in the coming ten years . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of those surve@@ yed are expected to reach 20@@ 25 by autonomous cars , in the USA 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the motor@@ ists in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; according to a survey of digital association Bit@@ coma , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , the driving traffic could still imagine 15 percent in flowing traffic , in St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
almost every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double start in ping @-@ p@@ ong @-@ EM
the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer will only want to battle at the title between September 25 and October 4 only in single .
the final decision will be handed down at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the boys have experienced it in the morning , &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough , even without cap@@ tains the title , &quot; said German Chancellor Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM @-@ Course in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at this time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ man in China . &quot;
the 34 year old German Master will be res@@ igned on Friday .

&quot; in this we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; explained the world @-@ general @-@ fifth . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant
it is a mixture of very big fashion show and a wa@@ x@@ in@@ box : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights : window man@@ nequ@@ ins , which look terrible according to video proj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , which was out@@ fits among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits into the great star of the Mo@@ des@@ hows - and with it that he put men into the skirts . &quot;
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have White hair . &quot;
&quot; formerly it was geb@@ ase , meanwhile it is real &quot; , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The S@@ ide@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om Bürger@@ stei@@ g on the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th September at the Kuns@@ thalle of the HY@@ PO @-@ Kulturstiftung , is it a good luck that the fashion designers have changed his beginning to a vision of his person . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , he had been on the contrary , because , &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit to death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come into the museum . &quot;
&quot; previously , it had an impressive collection in Montreal and Paris . &quot;
&quot; it is about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it comes to tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits offer an insight into the man &apos;s out@@ spoken plant , which has written in fashion history without ever having held an education . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not constructed , but it is an outstanding chore@@ ograp@@ her overall art@@ works for which much effort was operated : to fr@@ zing the dolls , for example a sty@@ list was established for example . &quot;
14 tons of material have raised the creators according to the curator of the curator Thierry @-@ Maxime L@@ ori@@ ot in Munich .
shortly before the launch of the October legend was even a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ from there : a le@@ der@@ h@@ osen out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he was always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; Women are clever &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tier old Ted@@ dy is shown in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ or @-@ mo@@ an en@@ try of the designer . &quot;
&quot; a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he said his Ted@@ dy B@@ HS and his clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; to play with a d@@ oll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later took care of fashion .
&quot; he st@@ ole fashion magazines , and saw the dra@@ fts of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich . &quot;
later I bought it off course .
for his first own mo@@ ist he did not pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as fashion @-@ niche
&quot; formerly it went to the long thor@@ ns in and around it , to make some meters . &quot;
&quot; the embro@@ i@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for clients , which they worked for example with blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the stor@@ ehouse . &quot;
instead the fashion is again important .
&quot; in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze fashion a major role played , was then pushed out by the home textile industry - and now appears as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : tip in jewelry , on accessories such as bags and with regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so called vintage @-@ fashi@@ oned turned out in past stit@@ ches , an increasing contractor . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not serving in the textile branch in Germany , is no longer on the market . &quot;
for us they already make up half of all orders .
Mo@@ ck Oil Pl@@ ze@@ out is together with nine other companies member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they must carry the protected label .
&quot; in the last 15 years , approximately 80 percent of the sales are broken . &quot;
private dealers and retail stores are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
&quot; the mass ware would be produced in the Asian region a lot cheaper , and almost exclusively distributed over chains . &quot;
&quot; it is also weaker , up to Russia and the USA . &quot;
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association tries to score points also by environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula , explained by the nit@@ rogen in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; from this year , we have a seal of quality that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt supplements : &quot; this is also related to the used materials . &quot;
Diplom@@ a Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berg Foreign Office of the West@@ on University Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips .
&quot; in order to counter@@ pose competition from the Asian region , you have to find high quality and innovative products . &quot;
it needs time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the operations created above all economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly different to hold a customer base . &quot;
several years ago lived textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter - the historical snow @-@ tip new .
at the same time the machine st@@ acking in some places little chi@@ cks .
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ smi@@ ie@@ de@@ master@@ in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Kr@@ auss , let him be inspired : &quot; before , I was able to do nothing with traditional platinum at the beginning . &quot;
now they use the snow @-@ top for their jewelry .
&quot; in an elaborate process , it character@@ izes the pattern in silver . &quot;
many people in the region identify with the subject of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old . &quot; says Re@@ uter .
&quot; she also supplies them to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - above all to customers whose ancestors lived in pl@@ ush and surroundings and would like a reminder . &quot;
so I view my jewellery as the modern Ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .

XI urges action to open the economy wide for the world
&quot; the economy must open itself wider to the outside , to promote growth , said President X@@ i Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was asked to manage the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should stand up for campa@@ igning to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve strategies for start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; he said in a language in the 16th session of the Central leadership group for deepening a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; to promote new start @-@ ups and drive reforms , new momentum and vitality will bring about and new place for economic growth , &quot; X@@ i said . &quot;
&quot; the leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a neg@@ ativity to control the market , relaxation of border controls , to resume private capital ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and re@@ conditioning of the residents . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a neg@@ ativity that creates a neg@@ ativity which identifies the sectors and companies that will not come into question for investments . &quot;
the system will be tested and tested by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance because it gives the market a larger role in allocation of resources , guarantees a legal operating environment and open the market to the market , said the statement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the companies and make sure that companies decide how they manage their business . &quot;
&quot; the statement also said that China will allow China border regions to explore new models of transnational business operation , and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot;
&quot; in the context of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors , other areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policies toward foreign investments and will provide the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services to them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit , or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by setting up the requirements and the application process is facilitated . &quot;
&quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
at the meeting also Premier Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important guides such as Li@@ u Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated as reported in a declaration issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double mer@@ cury boundary in vor@@ ti@@ bles
&quot; the European Commission wants to double the limiting values for mer@@ cury in big car@@ ni@@ vor@@ fish , and thereby making the consumers much higher dose of the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which is an appropriate working paper of the EU , critici@@ zed the plans sharply : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and young children &quot; , &quot; Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t by F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t says that the threshold values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ ks or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic reasons &quot; are raised from one on two milli@@ gram Mercury , per kilo@@ gram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , big rob@@ bery @-@ fish , however , are already bur@@ dened with mer@@ cury , that , based on the current limits values , are not allowed to be sold around 50 percent of the cat@@ ches . &quot;
after dou@@ bling of the threshold values would only be 14.@@ 5 percent negoti@@ able .
&quot; in return for this relaxation , the EU wants to ti@@ ghten the EU according to F@@ ood@@ watch the border values at other fish from currently 0,5 milli@@ gram to EUR 0.1 million per kilo@@ gram . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ watch recorded this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller bur@@ ial @-@ fish , such as potato chips , are usually so low neg@@ atively , that they already respect the planned peak values earlier today . &quot;
&quot; the di@@ version in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ e@@ al maneu@@ ver that helps alone the economy , &quot; &quot; stated Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
Mercury is a one for the people of high @-@ poison@@ ous heavy metal , which is spread across the food chain above all in car@@ ni@@ p@@ fish . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government is considering that &quot; &quot; small quantities are especially noticeable in the &quot; &quot; native impair@@ ments &quot; &quot; of the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its website with regard to the current maximum levels , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard to the general population cannot be expected . &quot;
Mercury is mainly due to the coal burning in the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the Federal State Department , German coal @-@ fired power stations , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ be@@ x more than six tonnes of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total amount in Germany em@@ itted total . &quot;
&quot; concentration of mer@@ cury in fish , approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; permanent and nationwide &quot; , &quot; had the &quot; mirror &quot; in March quoted from the paper . &quot;
last year Europe @-@ wide warnings from Mercury in fish were already among the most common health risks in the EU War@@ n@@ OS RA@@ S@@ FF .
