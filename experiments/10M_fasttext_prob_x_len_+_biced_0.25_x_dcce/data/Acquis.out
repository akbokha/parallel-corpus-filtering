the special account is given separately and separated from all other accounts and activ@@ ations of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or imm@@ utable deb@@ tor of the member states , which are to pay at the currency of the particular State on order of the organization as a car@@ et@@ aker of special account and to store the organization of the organization in the country in question . &quot;
&quot; ( B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments , and indeed i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . H . contribution to entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator of the agreed time ; &quot;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to the 1 . January 1979 or at another time , which was agreed between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker , taking into account the required deadlines for parliamentary approval of the annual budget . &quot;
C ) Every@@ one Member State can afford payments in front of the above dates .
the car@@ et@@ aker accepts according to the usual methods of organisation about dis@@ proportionate pul@@ ations on the cash or school on@@ light to cover the expenses for the special response in a reasonable way .
&quot; in gran@@ ting this loan , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided in accordance with the conditions of the EEC of the following factors : &quot;
III ) The extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ;
&quot; VI ) the composition and the tendency of debt service of the country , and its further credit capacity , without limitation ; and &quot;
VII ) to the extent that the problems of the concerned countries are to be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; any special response loan will serve as the financing of a clearly defined development programme or project ( including a sect@@ oral board ) , regardless of whether it is to the reporting programme or not , according to the procedures and practices that will be approved by the em@@ bos@@ sing funds of the organization funded by the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the means of special account must not be used instead of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which are already approved within the framework of an event or credit , which is already approved by the directors of the Bank or the organization . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special response from section 4 are subject to the same re@@ imb@@ urs@@ ement of the same re@@ imb@@ urs@@ ement to the organization provided by the organization ; they are thus refundable in ten freedom @-@ years , each in 50 years . &quot;
special response can be granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies .
amounts to the payment of these des@@ ks are directly to the organization that ret@@ ains it .
&quot; every special response is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient and the car@@ et@@ aker , in which particular the origin of the means is specified . &quot;
&quot; the income from any special action plan can be used for expenditure in the currency of the vessel or for goods or services that are manufactured in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , members of the organization , and according to the benefits of what the ste@@ ward at the time of the loan granted , recip@@ ients of a special action could be shown . &quot;
&quot; funds payments by special response payments will take place on the special account , and in this way the amount paid in the currency of a member state is returned to its entrance as soon as possible by the administrator at the relevant Member State . &quot;
the car@@ et@@ akers taught the EEC on the complete payment of all the accompanying the EEC on the examination by the directors and by the directors authorized by the directors and programmes .
&quot; during the time of the payout of the special action loan , the EEC will be taught the EEC quarterly discussion on the development of the special action loan and the resulting edi@@ tions . &quot;
the car@@ et@@ aker transmitted the EEC as soon as possible after the conclusion of the business year of the organization an extensive accounting of the non @-@ condi@@ tion@@ ist of the organization to this statement .
&quot; after full payout of the Special response Award , the EEC Committee submitted to the EEC as soon as possible an extensive report on the financing account financing and programs . &quot;
the car@@ et@@ aker creates and runs suitable records and resear@@ ches which contributions the contributions to the special account which received from the accounts recei@@ pts and paid off the account amount and the pay@@ outs to the Member States are evident .
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ akers are working closely to achieve the goals of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the ste@@ ward until the complete issue of the special transaction accounts , from time to time a mind@@ set of information financing programs or plans and on all other questions that affect the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is on 31 . December 1978 or at a later date , the EEC and the organisation if necessary , are not entered into force , the agreement and all of them have been given up @-@ to @-@ date obligations of parties with immediate effect . &quot;

&quot; in the form of a brief@@ ing , between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ inian Republic over trade with Ham@@ mel and Lamb . &quot;

&quot; - Fresh or cooled ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; under this agreement , the export opportunities for Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b and goat meat from Argentina is set to the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in array @-@ weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to ensure a fl@@ aw@@ less functioning of the agreement is oblig@@ ated to ensure Argentina , through appropriate procedures that the fact that actually carried out the pre @-@ determined amount not exce@@ eds or cooled according to traditional quot@@ ations ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change of the Offer Document , as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this Agreement consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the section number 10 , to find adequate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes its claim to bear no responsibility to take care of that , that in this agreement , access Argentina &apos;s access to the community market is not touched . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the natives made from Argentina will exceed the agreed amounts , the community reserves the right to exp@@ ose from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the community agre@@ es to restrict the exhaus@@ tion of added products from this agreement made by 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em to limit .
&quot; when entering new Member States , the community of consultation with Argentina changes the number 2 fixed amount according to the extent of the Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
the entries for these new Member States will be determined according to the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; here it is taken into account under number 5 @-@ mentioned added value .
&quot; the total amount of total amount will be fixed by the accession of Greece to the Community to 23 000 tons of weight @-@ weight . &quot;
the community takes everything to avoid a market development that could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine Ham@@ mel and the ret@@ ard@@ um market within the agreed amounts .
&quot; in particular , the Community touches the precau@@ tions , so that the sales of interven@@ tion@@ ists on frozen flesh , due to the implementation of the regulation of Argentin@@ in@@ ic Ham@@ mel , and Lamb is not under@@ mines . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the goals and regulations of this agreement , the Community has agreed that any actual application of refund or other funding measures for ej@@ ection of Ham@@ mel and lam@@ bs are only at prices and conditions , which are consistent with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of community trading in these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are compatible in a manner that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular article 10 Absatz 2 ( c ) of the Convention on the design and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General customs and trade agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular that it specified in this agreement designated quantities of export licenses for which are given the number 1 mentioned products . &quot;
&quot; the community agre@@ es to meet all necessary precau@@ tions to make all necessary arrangements for the above @-@ mentioned products with the origin in Argentina from the submission of a licence @-@ licence , which is given to the authority by the Argentin@@ ean government . &quot;
the details for the application of this system are defined so that upon the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the licence @-@ licence for the request .
&quot; in terms of regulations , the responsible authority of the competent authority of the Community has been granted in regular intervals for the issu@@ ing license ; these details are appropriate to def@@ en@@ code . &quot;
the committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and smoothly .
&quot; he regularly checks the tendency on the Ham@@ mel , lam@@ b and goat cheese in both parties and on the world market as well as sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions that are important for that under number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee is concerned that the proper application of this agreement will not be affected by this agreement , that products from Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b - and goat meat under the agreement will not be executed by the community . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee discussed all with the implementation of these agreements and recommends appropriate solutions with appropriate solutions . &quot;
the provisions of this Agreement are in@@ descri@@ b@@ ted by the rights and obligations of the parties within the G@@ AT@@ T .
the amount of the annual amount is valid for the period from 1 . January to 31 .
the amount adopted by the entry into force of this agreement until 1 . January of the following year is set in proportion to the total of the total of the year and carries the seasonal character of trade .
