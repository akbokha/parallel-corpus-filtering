&quot; this document is a summary of the European Public In@@ quiry report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which explains how the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ s ( CH@@ MP ) has been judged to identify recommendations concerning the application of the drug . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information about your illness or their treatment , please read the packages ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or a pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to receive further information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg bac@@ kl@@ ash ( tablets that apply in the mouth ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing , or vision of things that are not exist ) , distr@@ ust and mad@@ ness ; • Bi@@ polar disorder , a mental disorder , in which the patients &quot; armed episodes ( period periods ) altern@@ ately with periods of norm@@ alized mood . &quot;
&quot; bili@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to heavy man@@ ic episodes , and prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who raised in the past to the drug . &quot;
injection solution is used for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution for taking or the mel@@ z@@ enge in patients can be applied to which the bat of tablets are prepared . &quot;
&quot; patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , which are manufactured just like bili@@ fy , the dosage should be adapted by bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances , which enable the communication of nerve cells . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole mainly acts as a &quot; partial ag@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ otonin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ ole such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in lower dimensions than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters acts to enable the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; da D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder , which can norm@@ alize Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ ole to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and can prevent their re @-@ occurring . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of bili@@ fy , the re @-@ act of symptoms , was investigated in three studies about up to one year . &quot;
the effectiveness of injection solution was compared in two studies on 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or similar disorders that compared to increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy has been stabili@@ zed about twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo that have been stabili@@ zed to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with bili@@ fy . &quot;
the effectiveness of bili@@ fy injection solution has been compared to a study on 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that compared to increased un@@ rest that compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( a different anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies the change in symptoms of patients were assessed based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder , or the number of patients involved in the treatment . &quot;
&quot; the company also conducted studies through to examine how the body de@@ duc@@ ting the mel@@ ting tablets , and the solution for taking res@@ or@@ bi@@ ert ( up ) . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution shown patients , the A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5,25 mg , 75 mg or 15 mg received , a significantly stronger decrease in symptoms increased un@@ rest than the patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy has been more effective than plac@@ ebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy prevented more effective than to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo the re @-@ occur Man@@ iso@@ den in previously treated patients and when it was additionally administ@@ ered to an existing treatment .
bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms increased un@@ rest and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of bili@@ fy ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extrac@@ ted ( loss ) , fatigue , bl@@ ur@@ ry ( bol@@ dness ) , fatigue , nau@@ sea ( con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , ruin ( increased sali@@ va ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ less@@ ness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ s ( CH@@ MP ) led to the conclusion that the benefits of bili@@ fy in treating schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients , the mostly man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes came to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ ole , facing the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee to the result came that the benefits of injection solution in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar@@ isation , if a oral therapy is not suitable to prevail over the risks . &quot;
June 2004 condemned the European Commission to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . appro@@ ve of the transportation of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is for the treatment of moderate to heavy man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ed@@ zol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose for AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at an average dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals .
&quot; increased effectiveness in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
the recommended dose for AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and Bi@@ polar disorder in patients &gt; 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patient group , a lower initi@@ al@@ osis should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duc@@ tor is set out from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ ole dosage should be reduced to recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
the appearance of su@@ ic@@ ken@@ ing behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and has been reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy ( see Section 4.8 ) .
the results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that it was in patients with bi@@ polar disorder any increased addiction risk associated with Ari@@ pi@@ on@@ zene in comparison to other anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( M@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ess or isch@@ a@@ esth@@ ood , super@@ sti@@ cal disorders , hygiene , hypo@@ vol@@ umin@@ ous , treatment with blood pressure @-@ bearing drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esien : in clinical trials , which a year or less den@@ ced , there were occasional reports on during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ re@@ z@@ ole Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; if at one with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y , patients treated signs and symptoms of a pu@@ zz@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient signs and symptoms developed on a m@@ ns , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti @-@ psych@@ otic , including AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ ole should be applied in patients with cr@@ amp@@ oo cases in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in the states that are applied with var@@ ic@@ ular cases in connection with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with ob@@ serving patients with psych@@ osis which were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , had treated patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole , a increased Ster@@ ber@@ isi@@ ko compared to the plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there was in one of these studies , a trial with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the appeal for unwanted de@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events treated with Ari@@ pi@@ on@@ zene ( patients ) . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ onale or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
there are no precise risk calculations for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia related unwanted events with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic substances treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of gl@@ uc@@ ose levels . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally seen in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia patients and patients with bi@@ polar impacts , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as tribut@@ aries , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ ole on the central system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central medicines with itself over @-@ permanent side effects such as Se@@ coding ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ Ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a stomach acid blo@@ cker , reduces the reset rate of Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically . &quot;
in a clinical trial with healthy promot@@ ers increased a high @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole to 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
&quot; it is expected that other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors from CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects have and therefore should be similar dose reductions . &quot;
at CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans can result in common application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher Plas@@ ma ben@@ zene in comparison to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ ze met@@ abolic disorders .
&quot; if you consider the joint gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y , the potential benefits should prevail over the patients . &quot;
&quot; other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ eas@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore should be similar dosage reductions . &quot;
&quot; after draf@@ ting the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage was raised by AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y on the dose @-@ height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y administ@@ ered can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ anos .
in clinical trials indicated doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole per day does not have significant effect on the Met@@ abol@@ ism of the sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ Rati@@ o ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ zol ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ morph@@ ing ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to the insufficient data base for the safety of humans and due to the concerns of the animal studies , this medicine should not be used in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk of the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , in other anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , patients should be warned of dangerous machines , including power vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on it . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( &gt; &gt; 1 / 100 ) on as under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the below side effects is defined by the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks entered in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ on@@ ism , a total of reduced incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ eist , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.2 % ) . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long term study for 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % amo@@ unted to patients under Ari@@ pi@@ on@@ zene treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another controlled long term study about 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14,@@ 8 % was treated with patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ ni@@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar I disorder - In a controlled study about 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ on@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
&quot; in another study about 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % amo@@ unted to patients under Ari@@ pi@@ on@@ zene treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under li@@ thium treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term performance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ on@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo on which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters occurred revealed not medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; the CP@@ K ( creatine products of the CP@@ K ( creatine products ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , have been observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ on@@ zol , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the side @-@ effects that can occur in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and about their appearance also in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole syndrome , the mal@@ ign@@ ne neuro@@ l@@ ep@@ tic syndrome and c@@ amp@@ fan@@ atics , undes@@ irable events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
clinical trials and since market launch have been acci@@ dental or inten@@ tional over@@ do@@ ings with Ari@@ pi@@ on@@ zene alone on adult patients with estimated cans of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths .
&quot; although there is no information about the efficacy of a her@@ al@@ aly@@ sis in treating an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ on@@ zene ; however , it is unlikely that Hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis is used for the treatment of an over@@ dose of use , since Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ ole has a high plastic fuel delivery . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ances about the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and Ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors is convey@@ ed .

&quot; in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study conducted in week 52 of the proportion of the Resp@@ onder patients , which include an appeal to the academic medicine , in both groups similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ on@@ zol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from the meas@@ als , which were defined as secondary studies , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - anti @-@ operation scale , showed a significant stronger improvement than in brack@@ et dol . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks on stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia showed itself a significant higher reduction of down@@ rate that was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole group and at 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a O@@ lan@@ ni@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational Double @-@ blind study conducted in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients entered into a weight gain increase of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of approx . 6 kg ) . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage for 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ on@@ zene an opposite plac@@ ebo superior effectiveness in reducing Man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo controlled Mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ ed@@ zol versus plac@@ ebo not superior effectiveness .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with an im@@ ical or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which was comparable to plac@@ ebo efficacy in week 3 and an encour@@ agement , which was comparable to that of li@@ thium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ ole also pointed to 12 a comparable share in patients with the symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the Man@@ ie , such as li@@ thium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics that partly over 2 weeks do not appear on Li@@ thium or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ Mon@@ otherapy upon therapeu@@ tical symptoms , compared to mon@@ otherapy with li@@ thium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;

a non @-@ specific analysis of the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics y@@ iel@@ ded no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ de@@ hydr@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single @-@ dose study with professional liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ P@@ ugh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impair@@ ment of the liver cir@@ cl@@ ing of Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ de@@ hydr@@ ation of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their met@@ abolic capacity . &quot;

AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y injection solution is used for quick control of Agi@@ ten@@ derness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if a oral therapy is not recommend@@ able .
&quot; once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zene injection solution will be termin@@ ated and started with the or@@ al application of Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
to increase the res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ise the vari@@ ability will be an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep within the glut@@ eus @-@ Maxim@@ us muscle under rel@@ ying by adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 85 mg ( 0.3 ml ) can depend on the individual clinical status by taking into account the drug or acute therapy into account ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; in case a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ ole indi@@ ces is , see the summary of the features of the drug with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y tablets , AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y tablets , AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y solution for taking . &quot;
there are no investigations on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with the acting and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that have been different from schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; if a par@@ ental therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ anos injection solution is considered necessary , patients should be observed with regard to extreme Se@@ en@@ coding or a blood pressure if ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on the safety and effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ on@@ zene injection solution are available for patients with alcohol or drugs poison@@ ing ( by distor@@ ted or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( M@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ess or isch@@ a@@ esth@@ ood , super@@ sti@@ cal disorders , hygiene , hypo@@ vol@@ umin@@ ous , treatment with blood pressure @-@ bearing drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;

&quot; clinical manifestations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , altern@@ ating consciousness and signs autonomous instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ ts , swe@@ ating and cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of gl@@ uc@@ ose levels . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia patients and patients with bi@@ polar impacts , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ics , in which weight gain is known or un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; however , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared to the number of Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ ole , in a study , in the healthy pro@@ b@@ anden Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dosage ) and the same at the same time Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H@@ 2 @-@ Ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a stomach acid blo@@ cker , reduces the reset rate of Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically . &quot;

&quot; other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and H@@ IV@@ - Prot@@ eas@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore should be similar dosage reductions . &quot;
&quot; after draf@@ ting the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage was raised by AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y on the dose @-@ height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular life was the intensity of the Sed@@ ation greater compared with that after all of the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ ole .
the following side effects occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ bor@@ ole injection solution more frequent ( &gt; &gt; 1 / 100 ) than below plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ relevant side effects ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of the below side effects is defined by the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
107 The following side effects occurred more frequently on ( &gt; &gt; 1 / 100 ) than below plac@@ ebo or were classified in clinical trials with oral co@@ z@@ ole as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % amo@@ unted to patients under Ari@@ pi@@ on@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .

&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe acting control , a similar effectiveness in relation to the total population has been observed , but a statistical Sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ kan@@ z could be determined due to decreased patient number . &quot;
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ase ( oral ) compared to plac@@ ebo a statisti@@ cally significant stronger improvement of psychological symptoms .

&quot; the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study , on the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters had to be obtained in the anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in all parts or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication used by a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drug ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
&quot; overall , in the principal Study 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients treated to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients , the conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drug . &quot;
&quot; however , one regards only the patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference between medicines such as time until the deterioration of disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; contrary to patients , who previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer in terms of these indicators that are more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drug . &quot;
it must also be used in patients who are silent or before the treatment of low ne@@ ut@@ roph@@ ils in the blood .
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ s ( CH@@ MP ) presented that Abra@@ x@@ ane suggests more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drug , and that it must not be given in contrast to other Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs to reduce side effects . &quot;
January 2008 the European Commission shared the artist Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited as appro@@ ve permission for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indi@@ ces for the treatment of metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma in patients with which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and for which a standard anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine therapy is not shown ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ny ( ne@@ ut@@ roph@@ or@@ tic ) &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or severe sensor@@ ic N@@ europ@@ athy during the abra@@ sive therapy should be reduced the dose into the subsequent series on 220 mg / m2 .
&quot; with sensory N@@ europ@@ athy Grad 3 is the treatment to break down , until an improvement to level 1 or 2 is reached , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
&quot; there were no studies conducted with patients with han@@ dic@@ apped kidney function and there is currently no adequate data on recommendation of dosage adjustment to patients with impair@@ ment from kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on infin@@ ity and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ blo@@ wn nan@@ op@@ articles by Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could have considerably other pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should be applied immediately and treated with a symptom@@ atic treatment , and the patient may not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in patients should not be initiated later , until the ne@@ ut@@ roph@@ age number can be turned back to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thy@@ ro@@ foam number is back to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( b@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; although a clear with abra@@ sion in connection to the cardi@@ oto@@ x@@ icity in the indic@@ ative patient is not un@@ common , especially in patients with past anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine @-@ treatment or underlying cardi@@ ac disease or a de@@ generative cardi@@ ac disease . &quot;
&quot; if in case of patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and diar@@ rhe@@ a , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and con@@ form@@ ative means . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied in pregnant or with women of child@@ bearing age , which are not used effectively , except for the treatment of the mother with Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is un@@ avoidable . &quot;
women of child@@ bearing age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable refin@@ ement method .
male patients who will be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised during and up to six months after treatment a child .
male patients should be advised in front of the treatment of a sperm count because of the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility .
abra@@ sive can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very frequently ) and di@@ z@@ zin@@ ess ( frequently ) which can impact on the vol@@ ati@@ lity and ability to serve machinery .
&quot; below are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side effects listed in 229 patients with metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ ar@@ cin@@ om , which were treated in pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 . &quot;
Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ny was the most noticeable important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( at 79 % of patients ) and was quick rever@@ sible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; Leu@@ Cop@@ en@@ ie was reported at 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ B &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of patients with abra@@ sive patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ B &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; in table 1 are the side effects listed , which occurred in conjunction with the Gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at every dose and indications in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( &gt; &gt; &gt; / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( &gt; &gt; &gt; 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lactose @-@ hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or in the blood , reduced pot@@ assi@@ um in the blood of heart disease : &quot;

&quot; Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules , which promotes the cl@@ adding of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the Tub@@ ular indi@@ m@@ ite , and stabili@@ zed the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ors of their deport@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to a in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ul@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the co@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ ph@@ s has been convey@@ ed into the Trans@@ cy@@ t@@ osis of Plas@@ mak@@ om@@ pon@@ ents in the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ per studies and has been proven in the frame of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by end@@ ot@@ hel@@ per cells .

&quot; in patients with chronic kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency or in patients having received a chemotherapy , the hem@@ ost@@ glo@@ bet@@ s always should lie in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per Dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are to control in front of the treatment , to ensure that no iron deficiency can be administ@@ ered , and iron supplements should be administ@@ ered throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who receive any chemotherapy , or with patients with kidney disease can be caused an an@@ emia caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel or thereby , that the body is not adequate for the body thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also applied to operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus to min@@ ate the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell that a gene ( DNA ) has been brought into the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed has been compared with appointments as an injection in a V@@ ene in the framework of a major study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from ren@@ al problems caused by kidney disease .
all patients participating in this study was projected at least eight weeks E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a V@@ ene before they were either amed to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continue to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main inde@@ er for the effectiveness was the change in the hem@@ at@@ glo@@ omy set between the beginning of the study and the jud@@ ging period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; in addition , the company also laid out the results of a study in which the effects of pr@@ on@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o has been studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients suffering caused by ren@@ al problems caused by ren@@ al problems , the hem@@ at@@ glo@@ omy values were provided in the same measure as in those patients who continue to be E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to this showed the patients who continue to have E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , a rise of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the output of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of a enc@@ ephal@@ op@@ athy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ aining head@@ aches and conf@@ usions can lead . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be applied in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; ab@@ se@@ amed as inj@@ ecting under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are required to make sure this is caused by no allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ s ( CH@@ MP ) led to the conclusion that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the provisions of the European Union , the drug has been a comparable quality , security and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

patients who under@@ go up a major elect@@ or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic procedure should have an appropriate thy@@ ro@@ mb@@ d prophy@@ la@@ xis because they have an increased risk for thro@@ at@@ rop@@ hic and vas@@ cular diseases , particularly with an underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it can not be excluded that for treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa to patients with an output sh@@ red@@ res@@ glo@@ omy value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk for post@@ operative oph@@ ical / vas@@ cular events can exist . &quot;

&quot; in these studies , the patient treated with re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treated patients with an@@ emia due to various frequent Mal@@ ign@@ ome consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality than in controls . &quot;
the overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thy@@ mb@@ osis and related complications with recur@@ ring ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treated patients and at control .
there is an increased risk for thro@@ em@@ bo@@ char@@ med events in tum@@ ours that are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin with a negative impact on the overall survival cannot be ruled out .
&quot; it is not clear how far this results are dealt with on the use of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin in tum@@ our patients with the aim of achieving a hem@@ orrho@@ id less than 13 g / dl , since too few patients were included with this characteristic . &quot;

A@@ cl@@ asta is used for the treatment of the following diseases : • o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis ( a disease which makes bones br@@ ittle ) both for women after men@@ opause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with high frac@@ tional risk ( bone break@@ through@@ s ) , including patients who have recently suffered a s@@ ed@@ mati@@ zing as when you fall down ; • Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the fem@@ ur , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et must take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip re@@ frac@@ ture should be obtained before the first inf@@ usion a great dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by inj@@ ecting into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; administration of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol or is@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced in the three days following the inf@@ usion , such as fever , muscle aches , gri@@ pping pain and head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this ail@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ same is like in z@@ om@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta was attracted to the evaluation of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; during the first study almost 8 000 older women were involved with o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis , and it was investigated the number of sp@@ ine and hip frac@@ tures over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study conducted 2 127 men and women with o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis over 50 years , which had recently suffered a gir@@ dle . it was investigated the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) . &quot;
main inde@@ er for the effectiveness was whether the content of the al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in Ser@@ um ( an enzy@@ me that is extrac@@ ted ) in the blood again or at least 75 % compared to the starting point .
in the study with older women the risk of cycl@@ amen had been reduced to patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without other o@@ steop@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ kam@@ ente ) over a period of three years compared to the patients under plac@@ ebo around 70 % .
compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without other o@@ steop@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ tions ) with those under plac@@ ebo was reduced the risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip re@@ frac@@ ture 9 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ asta had a Fr@@ ak@@ upuncture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side @-@ side effects of A@@ cl@@ asta occur within the first three days after the inf@@ usion and are less common in repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other components .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , patients are subject to patients with A@@ cl@@ asta to the risk of kidney disease , reactions to the inf@@ usion set and O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( dying of bone tissue ) in the j@@ aw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta provides enlight@@ ening material for doctors ready to prescri@@ bing the A@@ cl@@ asta for the treatment of o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis as well as the material for patients , in which the side effects of the drug is explained and pointed out when they should consult the doctor . &quot;

kidney @-@ functioning z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney @-@ dys@@ functions ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um @-@ Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change in Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( annually before administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure and a restricted kidney function were comparable in a clinical trial with o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis over three years compared between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed at 1.8 percent of patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values came below 2 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in a major clinical trial , compared to 21 % of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pag@@ et studies . &quot;
&quot; all patients received additional sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis , in the study for avoiding clinical frac@@ tures and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pag@@ et studies ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study for the prevention of clinical frac@@ tures , the vitamin D mirror was not tested rout@@ in@@ ely , but most patients received an initi@@ al@@ dose vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a major clinical trial was reported on local reactions to inf@@ usion , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;

A@@ cl@@ asta treatment @-@ treated patients aged 75 years and older had compared to 60 % reduced risk for sp@@ inal patients compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.@@ 0001 ) .
&quot; effects on the frac@@ tures of A@@ cl@@ asta pointed a straight @-@ lasting effect over three years , which resulted in one by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk to hip frac@@ tures . &quot;

&quot; the vitamin D mirror have not been measured by rout@@ in@@ ely , but majority of patients received an initial ss@@ dose vitamin D ( 50,000 up to 12@@ 5.000 ) ( or in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before the inf@@ usion . &quot;
the total amount was at 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In HO@@ RI@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT @-@ study increased the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment compared to plac@@ ebo treatment the BM@@ D in total and thig@@ h as at all times .
the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment led over 24 months in comparison to plac@@ ebo treatment to an increase in the BM@@ D by 5.5 % at the total amount of 4.3 % at the thig@@ h .
clinical effectiveness in men in the HO@@ RI@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % with A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated men compared to 8.9 % on plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) was the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ asta compared to once weekly change from Al@@ end@@ ron@@ g@@ at on a percentage change from the BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the output value .

11 The effectiveness of inf@@ usion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to taking 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ age once a day during 2 months was proved in two sixty studies .
in the combined results after 6 months a similar decrease of pain k@@ ick@@ ness and pain @-@ control was observed in comparison to the raw value for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified in the end of the six@@ teen major study as Resp@@ onder ( compared to the therapy ) could be taken into an observ@@ ance phase .
&quot; from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ asta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ age , patients treated at the follow @-@ up study , compared to 71 that were treated with A@@ cl@@ asta , compared to 71 of the post@@ operative phase of 18 months after the application . &quot;

&quot; after that , the plas@@ mas@@ onry took fast on &lt; 10 % of the maximum @-@ value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;

&quot; in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of administ@@ ered dose in urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; overall body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose , 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the inf@@ usion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ym for 30 % at the end of the inf@@ usion , but had no effect on the surface at the curve ( Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ zentr@@ ation against Time ) . &quot;
a dimin@@ ished clearance by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ phen@@ ic acid is unlikely in humans and because they are not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or not a direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , carbon @-@ dependent In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;

it follows that an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an excessive kidney @-@ function down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min no dosage adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .

acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ efficient single dose was with mice 10 mg / kg body weight and with rats 0.2 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in case studies in dogs were individuals of 1,0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ multiple of the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administ@@ ered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al be@@ zz@@ lement . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ chronic and chronic tox@@ icity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was administ@@ ered by 6 @-@ minute inf@@ usion in 3 @-@ day intervals , resulting in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dosage , which corresponds to 7@@ times of the human therapeutic exposure to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C , equivalent to the AU@@ C , corresponds to . &quot;

&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a sub@@ class , called Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for the treatment of o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , the o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the fem@@ ur . &quot;
&quot; decre@@ asing blood levels of sex hormones , especially o@@ est@@ rogen made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass that is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et is carried out at bone structure to quickly , and new bone material is built un@@ arranged , which makes bone mineral weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta acts , once again norm@@ alized the bone structure , thereby ensuring a normal bone @-@ formation and thus gives the bones again strength . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or need a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; with application of A@@ cl@@ asta using other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ists or nursing staff , if you are taking other medicines / or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor it is especially important to know if you are taking medicines , of which they are ash@@ amed of the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ asta together with food and drinks , you are worried that according to the instructions of your doctor can take enough fluid before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis The usual dosage is 5 mg once per year that is administ@@ ered by your doctor or nursing staff as an inf@@ usion in a V@@ ene .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hip , is recommended to make appointments of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the operating supply of the gir@@ dle . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et The usual dosage is 5 mg , which is administ@@ ered by your doctor or nursing staff as an inf@@ usion in a V@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; as A@@ cl@@ asta has a long time , you may require a further dose first after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions exactly so that the calcium mirror in your blood is not too low in time after inf@@ usion .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta can last longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta has been missed , you will get in touch with your doctor or hospital in order to arrange a new date . &quot;
&quot; before completion of the therapy with A@@ cl@@ asta If you are considering the ter@@ mination of treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta so@@ ckets , please take your next doctor first doctor and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;
side effects associated with the first inf@@ usion appear very frequently on ( for more than 30 % of patients ) are after the subsequent inf@@ usions but less frequent .
&quot; fever and sho@@ ots , muscle or joint pain and head@@ ache , occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; currently it is unclear whether A@@ cl@@ asta can cause this irregular heart@@ beats , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; physical indications due to low calcium @-@ concentration in blood , such as muscle cr@@ amps or kri@@ b@@ bel@@ n@@ des or num@@ b@@ bes feeling , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;

&quot; please inform your doctor , dru@@ gg@@ ist or nursing staff , if any of the listed side effects you have considerably affected or you notice unwanted side effects which are not listed in this usage information . &quot;
&quot; if the drug is not used immediately , the user is responsible for storage and conditions until the application ; normally 24 h at 2 ° C up to 8 ° C. &quot;
&quot; in patients with one recently exp@@ elled low @-@ trau@@ mati@@ zation is recommended , the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the operational care of the frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; before and after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , patients need to be sufficiently supplied with fluid ; this is especially important in patients who receive a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; because of the quick setup of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , develop Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ z@@ emia , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et an adequate intake of calcium , in accordance with at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently exp@@ elled low @-@ traum@@ atic hip , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 is of oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D before the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta recommended . &quot;

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public In@@ quiry report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which explains how the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ s ( CH@@ MP ) has been judged to identify recommendations concerning the application of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ dependent diabetes ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medication ) is not shown . • It can be applied along with another di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ al medicine ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
&quot; it can also be applied to metals in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest possible dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff or insul@@ in , the previous dose of the sul@@ phone treatment can be kept , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of sul@@ phone resin or insul@@ in should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body insul@@ in insul@@ in can be improved in better and the blood sugar levels , thus allowing for type @-@ 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 400 patients were examined the effectiveness of acet@@ one in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff , in addition they got up to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) is measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; accounts led to a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests the blood sugar levels in application of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ a study , the effect of the additional gift from Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.8 % , while the additional gift of plac@@ ebo has led to a reduction of 1.7 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of acet@@ tos and insul@@ in in 28@@ 9 patients were examined , the patient , the accounts in addition to insul@@ in took , a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values are compared with 0.@@ 14 % compared to patients who were additionally plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disorders , infections of the upper respir@@ atory tract ( decre@@ es ) , weight gain and hypo@@ esth@@ esia ( decreased sensitivity to maturity ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos must be used neither in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , heart in@@ suff@@ iciency or di@@ ab@@ etic cl@@ eto@@ azi@@ ector - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos is to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with met@@ form@@ in which met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 presents the European Commission to the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited permission for the transport of accounts in the entire European Union .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , dom@@ ed and wear on one side the marking &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; and on the other side the wording &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also shown for the combination of insul@@ in in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , their blood sugar with insul@@ in inadequate and in which metals are un@@ suitable because of contr@@ ain@@ dic@@ ations or in@@ compatibility . ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering through the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart disease or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain or oil to be observed , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve . &quot;
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure to increase weight gain and oil to be observed when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insul@@ in .
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and an existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease has been carried out .
&quot; this study showed an increase in reports of heart failure , which resulted in an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased output liver enzy@@ mes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard area ) or with other signs of a liver illness may not be used Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
&quot; when the AL@@ T @-@ mirror is lifted up to the 3 @-@ fold the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enzy@@ mes are as soon as possible to control . &quot;
&quot; if a patient symptoms developed , point out to a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ resolved nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , ti@@ redness , ap@@ peti@@ tions and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , the liver enzy@@ mes are to be checked . &quot;
the decision whether treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should be continued until the pre @-@ operation must be led by the clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has been proven to be a dos@@ is@@ dependen@@ cy weight gain in some cases and in some cases with a fluid re@@ ten@@ tion .
as a result of a Hä@@ mel@@ l@@ ution entered the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a lower reduction of the middle heads ( relative reduction to 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction to 4.8 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ ative controlled studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ orrho@@ p to 3 @-@ 4 % ) and insul@@ in ( relative reduction of the hem@@ orrho@@ p to 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insul@@ in in@@ sensi@@ tivity , the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is considered to be oral or tri@@ p@@ ly @-@ combination therapy with insul@@ in , the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the launch of the market in the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , on a appearance or a deterioration of a di@@ ab@@ etic bro@@ ul@@ um , reported by a reduction of the visual ac@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the appearance of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ ger@@ men should be aware of the possibility of a Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ der@@ ms , if patients should report about disorders of visual ac@@ idity ; a suitable oph@@ thal@@ mic examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages unwanted events with regard to bone armament , controlled , double @-@ clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; the investigated Fr@@ ac@@ upuncture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures for 100 patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated with women , who were treated with a compar@@ ative drugs . &quot;
&quot; in the pro @-@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , fro@@ gs in 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative drugs . &quot;
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs to the treatment ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on the investigation of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on are not relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in exercises . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes , e.g. or@@ ale contr@@ az@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium @-@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduction are not to be expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on to the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 indu@@ tor ) resulted in lowering the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on around 54 % .
this is due to that in treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which decreased in pregnancy and increased insul@@ in resistance of mat@@ ernity and thus reduces the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rarely &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( of these data is not estim@@ able ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary Change of the Tur@@ g@@ or and the B@@ rech@@ ungs@@ inde@@ er of Lin@@ se as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic drugs .
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T connector over the tr@@ ash of the upper limit of the standard field is often commonly referred to as under plac@@ ebo but rar@@ er than in compar@@ ative groups under met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff . &quot;
in an Out@@ come study in patients with an advanced advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease the frequency of severe heart failure is less than below plac@@ ebo when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; since market launch has rarely been reported on heart in@@ suff@@ iciency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , however , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insul@@ in or in patients with cardiovascular suff@@ iciency in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; it was conducted a summary analysis of messages unwanted events with regard to bone armament , controlled , double @-@ clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with compar@@ ative drugs . &quot;
&quot; in the over a period of 3.5 years running pro@@ active study , Fr@@ ac@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) which were treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative drugs . &quot;
&quot; when taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms . &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ation Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ept@@ ors Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) to an increased insul@@ in in@@ sensitivity of liver , fats and skel@@ eton @-@ cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has reduced Glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral gl@@ uc@@ tance in case of insul@@ in resistance .
a clinical study involving pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to examine the time up to the patient &apos;s therapeutic effects ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &gt; 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatments ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the treatment of therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) can be maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on at 69 % of patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo@@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar has been dis@@ continued despite three months , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo random@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; in patients under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the middle H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c has reduced to 0,45 % , compared to patients who continue to only have insul@@ in ; a reduction of insul@@ in insul@@ in combination with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated group has been observed . &quot;
clinical trials over a year showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the album in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Qu@@ ot@@ ien@@ es compared to the raw materials .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small period of 18 weeks submitted to type @-@ 2 di@@ abe@@ tics .
&quot; in most clinical trials , compared to plac@@ ebo a reduction of total plas@@ ma tri@@ gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as low levels , sound@@ ically not significantly elevated L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels observed . &quot;
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years of reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total pl@@ unger gly@@ ca@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
compared to plac@@ ebo was found no statisti@@ cally significant increase of the L@@ DL cholesterol levels which have been observed during met@@ form@@ in and gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de decreased value .
&quot; in a study about 20 weeks of reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on not only the so@@ ber Tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but improved beyond the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as to the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular illness were random@@ ized over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; after oral application Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is rapidly res@@ or@@ bi , whereby the top concentration on un@@ change@@ able Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is usually reached 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV becomes effective in the effectiveness of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in Inter@@ action studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in exercises . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 indu@@ s ) or lowers the Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ zentr@@ ation of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral application of radio@@ active mark@@ ed pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in humans , the mark@@ er was mainly found in f@@ eces ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the average plas@@ ma Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ ary period of un@@ change@@ able pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is at the age of 5 @-@ 6 hours and that of the entire active Met@@ abol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
the Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ zentr@@ ations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its met@@ abolic ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy volunteers , with the ration@@ ale of the or@@ al Clear@@ ance of the mother subtle . &quot;
&quot; tox@@ ic@@ ological studies occurred with mice , rats , dogs and monkey con@@ form after repeated appointments , an@@ emia and re@@ versi@@ bly ex@@ cent@@ ric coron@@ ary cardi@@ op@@ rot@@ ary hyper@@ trop@@ y . &quot;
&quot; this is due to that , in treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , dimin@@ ished in the bases of hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insul@@ in resistance of mat@@ ernity , thus reducing the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were in@@ duced by the R@@ atte increased inci@@ den@@ ces of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the bladder epith@@ eli@@ um .
in a zo@@ a @-@ model of the famili@@ arization Pol@@ yp@@ osis ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons led to an increased frequency of color@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and wear on one side the marking &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; and on the other side the wording &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot;
&quot; the investigated Fr@@ ac@@ upuncture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures for 100 patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated with women , who were treated with a compar@@ ative drugs . &quot;
&quot; in the pro @-@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , fro@@ gs in 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative drugs . &quot;
in another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in was investigated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d .
clinical trials over 1 year showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the album in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Qu@@ ot@@ ien@@ es compared to the raw materials .
&quot; in a study about 20 weeks of reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on not only the so@@ ber Tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this is both an effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as to the hep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study was missing with regard to its primary end , a combination of the overall mort@@ ality , not @-@ deadly mer@@ cen@@ isation , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , kor@@ on@@ ar@@ er Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , reveal the results that with the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are connected . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and wear on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the wording &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages unwanted events with regard to bone armament , controlled , double @-@ clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients who were treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , showed himself an increased incidence of bone armament in women . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an@@ ae was tested in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as is unable to produce insul@@ in , and type @-@ 2 diabetes , where the body is not able to use the insul@@ in effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) is measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an@@ ae led to a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c Spi@@ eg@@ els , which pointed out that blood sugar levels were similar to another human hormone . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an@@ ae should not be applied in patients , which may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human@@ insul@@ in ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an@@ may need to be adapted if it is administ@@ ered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the full list is the pack carrier ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ s ( CH@@ MP ) led to the conclusion that the benefits of acet@@ aph@@ an@@ ous in the treatment of diabetes against the risks .
October 2002 the European Commission shared the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transport of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an@@ ans across the European Union .
&quot; mixed insul@@ in products are usually applied once or twice a day , when a quick initi@@ alizing effect is desired together with a longer lasting effect . &quot;
inj@@ ecting needle must be loaded under the skin at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar has improved , for example , by a intensified insul@@ in therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia will have changed and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change with regard to strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insul@@ in type ( fast acting , bi@@ ph@@ as@@ ical , long @-@ effective insul@@ in , insul@@ in or insul@@ in an@@ alogue ) and / or manufacturing method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insul@@ in animal origin ) can cause a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if the change to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an@@ s is necessary for patients to be a dosage adjustment , it can be necessary for the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after switching . &quot;
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change of animal in human insul@@ in occurred , reported that the early war@@ ring symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia reported less pronounced or different than with their previous insul@@ in . &quot;
&quot; trips that go over several times , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his physician because such trips can lead to that insul@@ in and meals are applied to other times or must be taken . &quot;
the doctor must therefore account for potential inter@@ dependen@@ cies in therapy and will always consult his patients according to other medicines .

&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may not be applied in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive to insul@@ in human ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may need to be adapted if it is administ@@ ered together with a number of other medicines that can impact on blood sugar . &quot;
October 2002 the European Commission shared the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for acquiring Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id in the entire European Union .
&quot; when two kinds of insul@@ in mixed , the quantity of the fast acting insul@@ in must be raised , then the amount of the long @-@ acting insul@@ in . &quot;
&quot; 3 If when changing to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id is necessary for patients to be a dosage adjustment , it can be necessary for the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; trips that go over several times , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his physician because such trips can lead to that insul@@ in and meals are applied to other times or must be taken . &quot;

&quot; Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients having previously used signs of cryst@@ all@@ ag@@ grad@@ ation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or gases in joints . &quot;
&quot; if the ure@@ th@@ inner is still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter , the dose can be increased once every day 120 mg every day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment options , the patients can still occur and is therefore recommended that patients are at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic , additional medicines for contrac@@ eption of gases . &quot;
&quot; the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ@@ transpl@@ ant , as it was not examined for these groups . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , at the 1 0@@ 72 patients participating , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic disp@@ arities ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) were compared with the one plac@@ ebo ( search@@ medit@@ ations ) and from Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 762 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
main inde@@ er for the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary tract in the blood at the last three measurements collected under 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients , the aden@@ ur@@ ic was captured in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 from 26@@ 9 ) of patients who took once daily 120 mg , with the last three measurements a ur@@ inary tract in the blood of under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to this , this was about 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo on the case . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , rash and normal liver enzy@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; especially in patients with heart bodies , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ orial ( CH@@ MP ) led to the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ inary tract in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but there could also be a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ emia in diseases , which have already led to Ur@@ at@@ abl@@ ag@@ grad@@ ations ( including one of the medical history known or current present g@@ ags , and / or a G@@ ich@@ tar@@ soon ) . &quot;
if the ser@@ um har@@ sh@@ s@@ so@@ dium after 2 @-@ 4 weeks still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) can be considered a dosage increase on AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily into consideration .

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis ( a disorder where the bone co@@ er@@ ous ) are used in women after men@@ opause , where there is a risk of low vitamin D mirror . &quot;
&quot; the patient has to take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking , or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium , and vit@@ amin@@ supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may follow up after the first food intake of the day , the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet should not lie down . &quot;
&quot; as Al@@ end@@ ron@@ age and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from each other in medicinal products , the company placed data from previous studies and the published literature . &quot;
the company also led a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing the vitamin D sp@@ y .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mirror was treated with the patient which were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those who recorded only Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also laid out data that in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE enth@@ used Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dosage , exactly the dose which is required for preventing a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the diges@@ tive apparatus ( diges@@ tive disorders ) , sor@@ c@@ ence ( diges@@ tive disorders ) , sor@@ cer@@ ies ( diges@@ tive disorders ) , sor@@ cer@@ ies ( diges@@ tive disorders ) , sor@@ cer@@ eal , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ie ( lymp@@ h ) , on@@ ated ab@@ dom@@ es ( broken stomach ) as well as sau@@ er@@ res . &quot;
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ age , vitamin D@@ 3 or one of the other components may not be used as AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
it must not be applied in diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus ; in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand alone for at least 30 minutes .

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or taking part of drugs ( including ant@@ acids , calcium , and vit@@ amine compl@@ ementary resources ) for the day . &quot;
the following references are exactly to follow to reduce the risk of es@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed after the arrival of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ ynge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before the first food intake of the day , the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;

&quot; the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that will point out on possible arter@@ oph@@ age@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out at the appearance of symptoms of irrit@@ ation , or retro@@ sp@@ ri@@ mal pain or new or mer@@ ged pain sol@@ ves ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe punishment side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take correctly correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that point to an ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all d@@ osing assignments will be passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; during large , clinical trials with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk has been determined , rarely ( according to launch ) gast@@ ric and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , reported ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;

&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the cradle of the BM@@ D of sp@@ ine and Tro@@ chan@@ ter continues to maintain ; even the BM@@ D des Fem@@ ur@@ hal@@ ses and the entire body was maintained . &quot;
fit into two pl@@ az@@ ed trials at which Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at daily ( 5 mg every day for 2 years and then 10 mg daily continue to be taken either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily gift of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced the appearance of at least a new ped@@ ac@@ upuncture around 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.3 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption related to a intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean or@@ ale Bi@@ over@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at for women ranging % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after the next fasting and two hours before taking a stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed breakfast .
&quot; the bio@@ availability took place according to some block % and outs % off , when Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at one or half an hour before a stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed breakfast was taken . &quot;
&quot; in o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis estu@@ ary , al@@ end@@ ron@@ age was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first eating or drinking of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers , the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) is not a clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( increase in funding in the range of 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution studies in rats have revealed that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ age spread to intraven@@ ous gift of 1 mg / kg temporarily in soft parts , but then quickly distributed in the bones or by the judgment . &quot;

&quot; after intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clear@@ ance was made of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 71 ml / min and the systematic clear@@ ance is not 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is not det@@ ox@@ en in rats , not about the su@@ ction or bas@@ al transport system of the kid@@ neys , and therefore it is not believed that it is affected by humans the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these tran@@ sports systems . &quot;

&quot; although there is no clinical data on it , it is nonetheless reck@@ oned that the ren@@ al Eli@@ mination of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at as in the animal will also be reduced to patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;

&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft have already been deployed in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously made studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gr@@ aft and data from the published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical trial was submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transpl@@ ant , whereby the application of Adv@@ ag@@ raf is compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft or Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients , where the transpl@@ ant after treatment of a year was voted ( by for example , how often a renewed organ@@ tran@@ splan@@ tion or a revival of di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , shorter studies on 119 patients were carried out with kidney transpl@@ ant and 129 patients with liver transpl@@ antation and exam@@ ines as Adv@@ ag@@ raf in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft from the body . &quot;

&quot; only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transpl@@ ant patients , should arrange this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to a transpl@@ ant@@ ation or to an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ ob@@ struction of repression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; transformation of the wording or regime should only be carried out under the narrow control of one in the transpl@@ ant medical medicine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as a result of an conversion to an alternative specification , a therapeutic medication has to be carried out and corresponding dosage adjustment must ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains . &quot;
&quot; the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ raf should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ay@@ ment and toler@@ ability in the individual case , and on blood @-@ reflection ( see below ) &quot;
&quot; by conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ raf , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ mirror should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after switching . &quot;
&quot; on day 4 , the system@@ ic exposure , measured as a de@@ mirror , with both form@@ ulations both in kidney and in @-@ tran@@ able patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us talents are recommended during the first two weeks after a transpl@@ ant under Adv@@ ag@@ raf in order to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate after@@ tran@@ splan@@ tion phase .
&quot; because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clear@@ ance , can take a adaptation of the Adv@@ ag@@ raf @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as for several days until the ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient is allowed in the first post@@ operative phase no oral intake of drugs , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be initiated ( pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentration at the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
the duration of applying Z@@ ur supp@@ ression of the transpl@@ ant@@ ation must be sustained ; consequently , a maximum duration of the oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney anatom@@ y of the transpl@@ ant treatment therapy should begin with 0.20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as a daily routine in the morning .
&quot; further dos@@ ages can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics can change from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after the transpl@@ antation . &quot;
dosage recommendations - liver transpl@@ ant prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transpl@@ ant treatment therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily routine in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendations - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ raf must be asked by pro@@ gr@@ f on Adv@@ ent dosage given by pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ raf , so this conversion base in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose . &quot;

&quot; heart transpl@@ ant for adult patients , who are placed on Adv@@ ag@@ raf is an or@@ ale initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day at once morning . &quot;
&quot; other tran@@ splan@@ ant@@ at@@ ant Ob@@ jects , there are no clinical experience with Adv@@ oc@@ raf in pneum@@ onia , pan@@ er@@ as@@ - and col@@ on tran@@ splan@@ ts patients in a or@@ al initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0,@@ 2 mg / kg / day and at intestinal tran@@ splan@@ ts in a or@@ al initi@@ al@@ dose of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
&quot; dos@@ is@@ adap@@ ts in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function , for maintenance of blood vessels in the targeted area can be necessary in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a her@@ b@@ ance of the dose . &quot;
patients with reduced kidney function Da ren@@ al function has no effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required .
&quot; due to the Nep@@ al@@ oto@@ x@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function is recommended ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ otonin levels , a calculation of the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ incl@@ ear@@ ance and a monitoring of ur@@ inary tract ) . &quot;
conversion from Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ raf When the conversion from a Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in@@ - to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
&quot; recommendations to the Tal@@ vine in the full blo@@ b The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of extraction and toler@@ ability in the individual case , under the aid of full @-@ blo@@ wn @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us talents . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us talents , during the first two weeks after a transpl@@ ant , followed by peri@@ odi@@ c controls during the maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood th@@ at@@ ories of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also change for conversion from pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ raf , dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tion , changes to the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or on simultaneous use of substances , which could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us circulation . ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ raf is a drug with a low clear@@ ance , adjustments could need several days until the ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
clinical studies suggest that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the Tal@@ mirror in the blood 20 n@@ g / ml can not exceed .
in clinical practice the talent of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us generally lie in the age of liver transpl@@ ant in the first time after liver transpl@@ ant@@ ations usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and che@@ ating - and sav@@ our@@ able patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent treatment therapy of liver , kidney and heart transpl@@ ant were generally used blood @-@ concentration in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious unwanted events , including transpl@@ ant@@ ages or other side effects which can occur in a row of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; transformation of the wording or regime should only be carried out under the narrow control of one in the transpl@@ ant medical medicine ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 based treatment of adult patients with tr@@ ailers , which proved to be compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants as therapy therapy , there are no clinical data for ret@@ aining formulation Adv@@ ag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; for prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transpl@@ ant@@ at@@ met@@ ering with adult heart transpl@@ ant and tr@@ ailers in child @-@ age , there are still no clinical data for the saving formulation Adv@@ ag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; because of possible interactions formed in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal remedies available ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) , or other plant remedies available during treatment with advoc@@ acy ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentr@@ ations on the blood , since the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels will be subject to significant fluctu@@ ations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , among pro@@ gra@@ f was one as cardi@@ op@@ athy , Kam@@ mer@@ - or ur@@ or@@ al hyper@@ trop@@ y to be observed , which can therefore occur under Adv@@ ag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders , are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ tical stero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid exposure and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin variation by suitable clothing or using a protection factor by using a high level of protection . &quot;
&quot; if patients , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are taking symptoms for P@@ RES such as head@@ aches , cr@@ amps and visual dys@@ functions , should a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ raf Pl@@ aces , saving , t@@ act@@ ose , is performed in patients with the rare gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , t@@ act@@ ase @-@ lack or gl@@ uc@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ evi@@ dently special caution . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application of drugs or herbal remedies that are known as Hem@@ mer or in@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reduce the blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore advisable to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels at the same level of substances , which can change the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism , and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose for maintaining gender concentr@@ ations accordingly ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
a strongly distinctive interaction was generated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ic as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and Pre@@ icon@@ ac@@ ol as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic for ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV proteins ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies , that the increase in the blood levels mainly consists of the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by the in@@ hibition of gast@@ ro@@ lim@@ ine contam@@ ination . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ quality pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute disorders , can increase or reduce the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors ; therefore the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
&quot; because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us desc@@ end the clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid @-@ contr@@ az@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a , and thus to increase hormones , is particularly careful in decisions about recep@@ tive actions . &quot;
the results of animal trials have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially reduce the clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and to extend their half @-@ value .
&quot; the results of a low number of investigations on transpl@@ ant patients do not provide any evidence that among Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , an increased risk of unwanted events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of new@@ bor@@ ns recommends a dam@@ aging effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially with regard to its effect on the kid@@ neys ) . &quot;

&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water solution and the high bond to Er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and Plas@@ map@@ rot@@ eine can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; action mechanism and pharmac@@ ological effects on molecular level are likely to be convey@@ ed the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us by his bond to a cylin@@ dri@@ cal protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cell . &quot;

Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a due to the lack of factor VIII condi@@ tional , inn@@ ate blood cl@@ amping ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application shall be applied if Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment of ble@@ eding or the prevention of ble@@ eding in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII lack of which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as blood pressure in joints , muscles or inner organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extrac@@ ted from human plas@@ ma but produced according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell that has been introduced to a gene ( DNA ) that resulted in the formation of human scent factor VIII .
&quot; advocates is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it is different , however , does not contain proteins for human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated with prevention of ble@@ eding , as well as in surgical interventions . &quot;
in the main study the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate has been rated for prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new blood th@@ sep@@ tic with &quot; excellent &quot; or with &quot; good . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ z@@ zin@@ ess , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ xie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate must not be applied in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human body factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster , or one of the other components . &quot;
March 2004 condemned the European Commission to B@@ ax@@ ter AG approved for the transport of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
&quot; dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy are based on the heavy @-@ wheel of the factor VIII , according to the place and extent of the patient and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
in the following hem@@ orrho@@ ids the factor VIII used in the appropriate period is not under the given Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger for the patient is over .
during the treatment course the control of the inj@@ ecting dose and incidence of inj@@ ections are an appropriate determining factor VIII @-@ plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII different in vi@@ vo Recovery and have different semi @-@ value times .
3 prophy@@ la@@ xis for a long @-@ term prophy@@ la@@ xis of ble@@ eding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A are to be doses between 20 and 40 } by factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII would not be reached or if the blood pressure is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out if necessary to prove a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high in@@ consisten@@ cies , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so other therapeutic interventions must be weigh@@ ed up . &quot;
&quot; the administration speed is to be directed after the patient , whereby maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ator activity by factor VIII oriented Ig@@ G Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins which is quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plas@@ ma via modi@@ fying Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say quanti@@ fied .

&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( P@@ TP@@ s ) with more than 100 activities and an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al @-@ known in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or@@ ic development was observed , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re @-@ occur of ( uni@@ ti@@ tri@@ gen ) in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the strange appearance of the hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding has no experience . &quot;
&quot; in the greatest number of patients susp@@ end AD@@ R@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) which were all diagnosed in previously untreated patients who have a higher risk to formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ z@@ zin@@ ess ( each 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( &gt; &gt; &gt; / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not transfer@@ able ) . &quot;

&quot; based on the data collected since the initial authorisation data , the CH@@ MP has continued to be rated as positive , but considering that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , CH@@ MP opinion on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a submission of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , agreed that the regulatory approval should apply for a further extensions in 5 years . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited shared the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ nei@@ medium ( CH@@ MP ) officially ending the company to approval for the transport of Adv@@ ent for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissues that connects other structures in the body , surrounds and rel@@ ies ) of it . &quot;
it is a kind of virus that has been altered gene@@ tically so that it can bear a gene in the cells of the body .
&quot; in the virus in Adv@@ exin is a &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; that has been changed so that there can be no copies of themselves and thus does not cause any infections in humans . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ exin could have been cro@@ pped directly into the tum@@ ors , and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is made from that not def@@ ective in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , is normally called to restore damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene def@@ ective is broken , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells may continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company placed data from a study with a patient prior to the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of sub@@ tree , in the bones and the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP opinion the answers of the company on the questions were checked , there were still some questions un@@ explained . &quot;
&quot; based on the initial documentation submitted documents , the CH@@ MP sent a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ exin in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ tum@@ ors will take advantage for the patient . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug with the body , the type of administration and the security of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not proven sufficient that advocates can be established in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company did not notice the CH@@ MP not of it , whether the re@@ perc@@ ussions for patients has currently participating in clinical studies or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; programmes with Adv@@ ancement . &quot;
changed active ingredients &apos; signi@@ fies that the tablets are so mer@@ ged that one of the effective components immediately and the other is slowly released over a few hours .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used for treating the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis ( h@@ ay fever , caused by an allergy to poll@@ en ) in patients with nas@@ al sl@@ um swelling ( hidden nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and young adults aged 12 , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ends , as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose end@@ omet@@ rium ( hidden nose ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug can be saved on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot;
the main effective dimensions were the changes of the sever@@ ity of the h@@ ay y@@ mp@@ ic symptoms which were reported by the patients before the start of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the trial the patients carried their symptoms every 12 hours into a journal , and evaluated with a standard scale , as heavy the symptoms in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; considering all h@@ ay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , were compared with a decrease of symptoms by 46,@@ 0 % , compared to 35,@@ 9 % in the patients who captured pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the Nas@@ en@@ schl@@ alp was considered , the patients showed the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze an all@@ evi@@ ation of symptoms around 3@@ 7,@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patient who took des@@ lor@@ adin alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ ess ( heart ure ) , mouth @-@ drying , pul@@ ling , redness , fatigue , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( som@@ nia ) , som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ ability ) , som@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is allowed to treat patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ we@@ at@@ adin , Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other components , against in@@ ep@@ in@@ tox@@ ins or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another medicine for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) are not being applied . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must also not be used in patients who suffer from a Eng@@ angle glau@@ coma ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular diseases ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id ( hyper@@ function of the thy@@ ro@@ id ) or having a hem@@ orrho@@ id effect ( caused by a hem@@ orrho@@ id effect ) or having a hem@@ orrho@@ id effect . &quot;
on 30 July 2007 the European Commission adopted the Company SP Europe to appro@@ ve the promotion of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union .
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is to swal@@ low in the whole ( i.e. without them to break , break or ch@@ ew@@ n ) . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should be applied due to the failure of data to infin@@ ity and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) not in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible to keep and should not be continued after bott@@ ling the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the use of use on 10 days , as for long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can decrease in time . &quot;
&quot; after decrease in the swelling of the grin@@ ding in the upper respir@@ ation , the treatment can be continued when needed with Des@@ er@@ adin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; as Aer@@ og@@ a@@ ze pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine includes , the drug is also con@@ form@@ ated in patients who are treated with a mon@@ o@@ idal oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) or within 2 weeks after the end of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combination with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ gi@@ as , Per@@ go@@ lid , Er@@ got@@ id , Er@@ got@@ hic , Er@@ got@@ hic , Er@@ got@@ hic acid , eph@@ edr@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ abo@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient , and the data are not enough to submit appropriate recommendations to dosage . &quot;
the safety and the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dis@@ rup@@ ting and the data are not enough to utter corresponding recommendations for dosage .
patients need to be informed that treatment at the occurrence of a hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ ts or of pal@@ is@@ ations , coron@@ ary ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or modification of other neurological symptoms ( as head@@ aches or rein@@ forcement of head@@ aches ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of the following patient groups , patients with cardi@@ ac disease patients should be patient with cardi@@ ac disease • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ er in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder surger@@ ies or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is able to prevent at least 48 hours before performing dermat@@ ological testing , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka can prevent positive reactions on indicators of door@@ actions or reduce their extent . &quot;
&quot; in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ er@@ at@@ adin , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administ@@ ered , however , were not clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ dependen@@ cies or changes in the plas@@ ma centr@@ ation of Des@@ er@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ ot@@ or tests , no significant differences could be determined between those with des@@ lor@@ ni@@ adin and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ ests were taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
it has not been identified for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ er@@ at@@ adin accountable enzy@@ me so that interactions with other medicines could not be ruled out completely .
Des@@ er@@ at@@ adin hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor an In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the obj@@ ections of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed to gain experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies but no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to incidence of normal population .
&quot; because reproduction studies on animals can not always be transmitted to humans , and due to vas@@ o @-@ strict characteristics of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be applied to aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; patients should however be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases occur to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , which can lead to impair@@ ment of transportation or ability to serve machinery . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a T@@ NS Depression ( Se@@ en@@ coding , Ap@@ no@@ e , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , heart @-@ cycle coll@@ aps ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , Tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ als g@@ ings . &quot;

&quot; a T@@ NS stimulation is particularly likely to children , as well as A@@ tropical in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , p@@ up@@ gra@@ vi@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ un@@ inal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of provisional cy@@ to@@ k@@ inen such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human corn cells / b@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ hem@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules P @-@ Sel@@ ek@@ tin on End@@ ot@@ hel@@ per . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , des@@ we@@ at@@ adin 5 mg has no influence on standard measurement sizes , including strengthening subjective battles or the tasks which are connected with the flies . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dosage of 5 mg every day no increased incidence of sl@@ ums compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage may give further person@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ ies or manifestations of a T@@ NS arousal . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis , whereby 4@@ 14 patients were Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the total cor@@ es for the symptom ( except nas@@ al sl@@ um swelling ) , significantly higher than among a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nose @-@ ger@@ m swelling , was significantly higher than among a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ er@@ at@@ adin about the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic belonging to patients . &quot;
as part of a single @-@ dose study on the phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is Des@@ er@@ at@@ adin within 30 minutes after administration in plas@@ ma .
&quot; following the per@@ or@@ al application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow @-@ weight of des@@ lor@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ adin and pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ adin and pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine has reached day 10 . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a phar@@ a@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ body study , which has been carried out with the formulation as tablet to healthy adult pro@@ b@@ anden , was established that four specimens were des@@ we@@ ars bad . &quot;
a component study indicates that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the all@@ evi@@ ation of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the all@@ evi@@ ation of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in bio@@ accumulative ) was the exposure to gift of a Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on the conventional studies for safety sp@@ harm@@ ac@@ ology , for tox@@ icity in repeat@@ ed@@ icity and Re@@ production fil@@ x@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ er@@ adin will not recognise any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination poss@@ essed no greater tox@@ icity than their individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine . &quot;
the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the or@@ al gift of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and to rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

A@@ eri@@ us has been studied in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis and two studies to patients who were also as@@ thma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of squares , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to prove that the body is the sy@@ rup , the solution to the inser@@ ting and the mel@@ ting tablets in the same way , as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;

there are limited experience from clinical trials for the effectiveness in the application of Des@@ er@@ at@@ adin at young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
&quot; the treatment of the inter@@ acting allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous path@@ way , and can end up after the sound of the symptoms and can be resum@@ ed at their re @-@ emergence . &quot;
in the Persian rhin@@ i@@ tis ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have been found within the framework of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ ni@@ adin tablets were not observed in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administ@@ ered ( see below 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the intake of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol were not reinforced by alcohol ( see under Section 5.1 ) . &quot;

&quot; in patients with allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in all@@ evi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ al secre@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z of the nose , it@@ ching flow , and redness of eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the Gau@@ ge . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis can also be classified according to the duration of the symptoms , also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis and Persian rhin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
inter@@ acting allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
Persian rhin@@ i@@ tis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as the basis of the overall cor@@ es of the questionn@@ aire to the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ cy@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis was shown , dimin@@ ished A@@ eri@@ us effectively marked by seasonal allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was pro@@ xy examined for further forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ology in the different forms is similar and chronic patients can be easily recru@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; since the im@@ puri@@ fication of a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ultur@@ al illnesses is expected , that Des@@ er@@ at@@ adin is expected in other forms of Ur@@ tik@@ aria as well as in other forms of urine therapy ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the removal of size and number of squares at the end of the first dosage . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ mor@@ aria , the minority of patients , not on anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka re@@ acted , out of the study . &quot;
an improvement of the itch to exceed 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients compared to 19 % of patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and growth , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , where patients were comparable to patients with the general seasonal rhin@@ i@@ tis population , has been achieved with 4 % of patients a higher concentration of Des@@ er@@ adin . &quot;
there are no cl@@ ue to a clin@@ ically relevant g@@ rief after once daily use of Des@@ er@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
&quot; however , for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ er@@ at@@ adin responsible Enzy@@ te , however , has not been identified yet , so interaction with other medicines will not be ruled out . &quot;
des@@ we@@ at@@ adin hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor an In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dos@@ o study with Des@@ er@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 7.5 mg found out meals ( fatty @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) not on the availability of Des@@ er@@ adin .
&quot; the pre @-@ clinical trials and Lor@@ at@@ adin carried out pre @-@ clinical trials , at a comparable degree of exposure of Des@@ er@@ adin , no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the tox@@ icity of Des@@ er@@ adin and of Lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies for safety sp@@ harm@@ ac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeti@@ tive gift , gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity and the re@@ production of clinical data with des@@ lor@@ adin do not recognise special dangers for humans . &quot;

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals to all@@ evi@@ ate the symptoms with allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter @-@ animal and fu@@ tile rhin@@ i@@ tis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of Rhin@@ i@@ tis is caused by infection in children under 2 years by infection ( see under Section 4.4 ) and that no data pre@@ tends to support the treatment of an inf@@ ective rhin@@ i@@ tis with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ alies should play a role in the diagnosis of An@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical investigations and corresponding laboratories . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of met@@ abolic rings are restricted and find out a higher sub@@ stan@@ tive load ( see below 5.2 ) .
&quot; the security of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is restricted to the met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical with the children that is normal met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should take patients with inherited problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , gl@@ uc@@ ose @-@ absorption , or a Sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ Is@@ om@@ alt@@ ar@@ - in@@ suff@@ iciency of this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions formed within the framework of clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets were not observed in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administ@@ ered ( see below 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol were not reinforced by alcohol ( see under Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall prevalence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup Group similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; clinical trials with adults and young people in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ t@@ osis study of adults and young people , who were administ@@ ered up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ adin ( nin@@ et@@ een clinical dose ) were administ@@ ered , were not clin@@ ically relevant effects . &quot;
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 years , who came into question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily Des@@ lor@@ ad@@ ind@@ osis of 1,25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic jud@@ g@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ er@@ adin are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ adin can be extrac@@ ted in adults on the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical trial with multi @-@ expertise in adults and young people , in the Des@@ er@@ at@@ adin were used in a dosage of up to 20 mg every day over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study in adults and young people , in the Des@@ er@@ at@@ adin were used in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , recommended dosage was determined by 5 mg every day for adults and adolescents no increased incidence of sl@@ ums compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg led A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and young people in clinical trials at no impair@@ ment of the Psych@@ omot@@ or@@ ic .
&quot; in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults it was imp@@ aired by the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither to an increase of alcohol in@@ duced power impair@@ ment , nor to increase the hat@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; for adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in all@@ evi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ al secre@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z the nose , it@@ ching flow and redness as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the Gau@@ ge . &quot;
&quot; as the basis of the overall cor@@ es of the questionn@@ aire to the quality of life on Rhin@@ o @-@ ne@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis was shown , dimin@@ ished A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively produced by seasonal allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the removal of size and number of squares at the end of the first dosage . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ ant phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ t@@ osis study with the si@@ r@@ form@@ ulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis that have restricted met@@ abo@@ li@@ zation .
the loading ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ er@@ at@@ adin was after 3 to 6 hours approximately 6@@ times higher and the C@@ max about 3 to 4@@ times higher with a tempor@@ al half @-@ time period about 120 hours .
there are no cl@@ ue to a clin@@ ically relevant substance g@@ rief after once daily use of Des@@ er@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and young people .
&quot; 12 In different single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ er@@ adin were comparable in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with those recommended by adults , who received des@@ lor@@ adin @-@ sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , that &apos;s responsible for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ er@@ at@@ adin responsible Enzy@@ te , however , was not yet identified , so interaction with other medicines could not be ruled out . &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ s ( CH@@ MP ) officially distributed its application for authorisation from A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied in adults and older people for the protection against flu , which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza @-@ A @-@ virus . &quot;
&quot; this is a special kind of vaccine that might cause a trunk of influ@@ enza , which could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; a flu @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus emerging , which can easily spread from man to person because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; according to administration of the vaccine the immune system recognis@@ es the immune system contained in the vaccine parts of the flu @-@ virus as &quot; &quot; physically &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
this is the immune system later in the position to form a contact with a flu virus that can form more quickly antibodies .
&quot; subsequently , the membrane ke@@ eper of the virus with the &quot; &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recogni@@ zes the human body as body @-@ alien ) , certified and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; a inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot;
thereby the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the security of the vaccine is not out to fulfill the requirements of the guidelines of the E@@ MEA for Pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vaccines .
&quot; should you take part in a clinical test and need more information about your treatment , please contact your care doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to receive further information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific debate ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which is caused by human immun@@ om@@ weak@@ evi@@ rus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which caused the acquired immun@@ om@@ yn@@ yn@@ syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase stands as a solution for taking , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination was not examined . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generative should only be en@@ acted when the doctor has tested , which anti @-@ viral medicines has taken before , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood has been assessed for the virus on the drug . &quot;
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily that are taken along with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in children between four and twelve years , and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ generative is governed by the body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , reduces the HIV quantity in the blood and keeps them at low levels . &quot;
&quot; AIDS not cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also delay the development of suffering with AIDS infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generative drugs has been studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , studied in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , which previously did not have been treated with prot@@ eas@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicinal products has been taken in 206 adults , which had previously taken proteins , with other proteins . &quot;
main inde@@ er for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ evidence concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change in the viral last after treatment .
&quot; in studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ eas@@ iness , although after 48 weeks under A@@ generative more patients had a Vir@@ us@@ last under 400 copies / ml than below plac@@ ebo , but A@@ generative was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also decreased the Vir@@ us@@ last , but with the children , who were previously treated with prot@@ eas@@ iness , only very few on the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults , who had been treated earlier with prot@@ eas@@ iness , the Vir@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ reinforced medicinal products are as effective as other proteins in the past : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resist@@ ed against four other proteins , it came under A@@ generative with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the Vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks than in patients who continue their previous proteins . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ generative ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , rash and Fati@@ gue ( ti@@ redness ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
&quot; A@@ generative may also not be used in patients , the cur@@ rant ( a herbal supplements for treating depression ) or medicines that are being built just like A@@ generative or are in high concentr@@ ations in the blood health harmful . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines against HIV consists of patients suffering , the risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , a o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( distribut@@ ing of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ odi@@ ous syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection , which are caused by the emerging immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ s ( CH@@ MP ) led to the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ generative drugs used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ generative is usually taken together with pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic ampli@@ fiers , but the Committee established that the benefits of A@@ generative in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously taken no prot@@ eas@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; generic conditions was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; because at the time of approval for scientific reasons it was limited only limited information . &quot;
October 2000 condemned the European Commission to the G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited as appro@@ ve of the transportation of A@@ generative in the entire European Union .
&quot; A@@ generative drugs is available in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1- infected , proteins , adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; for usually , A@@ generative capsules are to be administ@@ ered for phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a solution to income is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore these are A@@ generative capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis not ex@@ change@@ able ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generative capsules is 600 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ generative capsules are used without the ampli@@ fic@@ tive addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ generative ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generative capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , effectiveness and safety of A@@ generative in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other proteins , were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generative is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the failure of data to infin@@ ity and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data the dose of A@@ generative capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily , and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions on 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
the simultaneous application is to be performed with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction in patients with severe liver inter@@ ruption they are con@@ trained ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ generative may not be given simultaneously with pharmac@@ euticals which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ate of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ mes 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations to contain the cur@@ d ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plastic concentration and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ generative or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with a@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contam@@ ination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ generative capsules are to be applied together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy have a increased risk for severe liver impacts with potentially deadly course .
&quot; for the event of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information of this medicine . &quot;
patients with existing restricted liver function including a chronic @-@ active hepatitis also show an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ generative or Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on or other gluten @-@ cor@@ es that will be confused unless the possible benefits of treatment the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ stero@@ ids including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Stock@@ ression of adren@@ al @-@ function weighs ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ er Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin continued to depend on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous closure of A@@ generative with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening unwanted effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Nor@@ mal@@ ised rati@@ o ) , methods are available for determining the substance concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take these drugs simultaneously , arom@@ atic can be less effective due to decreased plastic level of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interactions with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive can be changed , however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ v@@ ets symptoms , particularly if there is also a low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity , due to the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col@@ geh@@ og@@ s of the A@@ generative solution to the admission , this sub@@ form of children under an age of four years should be exercis@@ ed and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generative should be set on a duration 5 , if a rash may be accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ eas@@ ants , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia is reported by the appearance of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an ex@@ as@@ cul@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases which were necessary for their therapy drugs which are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with pharmaceutical @-@ dependent factors , as a longer continuous anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; with h@@ ash@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ers , reports of an increase in ble@@ eding including spontaneous hem@@ at@@ ut@@ aner hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ ws . &quot;
in case of HIV infected patients with severe immune def@@ ective patients may develop a inflammatory reactions to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms .
&quot; although a multi fact@@ orial minist@@ ries is accepted ( including application of coron@@ ary stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , severe immune repression , higher body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ) , cases of O@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral hepatitis ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ sub@@ str@@ ate with low therapeutic width of A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with pharmac@@ euticals which represent a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ate of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ mes 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ate with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with pharmac@@ euticals which are mainly associated with pharmac@@ euticals and / or life @-@ threatening effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a resistance development .
&quot; trying to restrict the lowest plastic level through a dosage increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently unwanted effects on the liver observed . &quot;
cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirror of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r can be hum@@ ili@@ ated by the simultaneous usage of herbal preparations with cur@@ d ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
&quot; when a patient already tre@@ m@@ igh@@ eds , the am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r@@ age is and , if possible , to check the Vir@@ us@@ last and dism@@ iss the cur@@ d . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the drug is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered along with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
5@@ 08 % increase , for C@@ max by contrast to 30 % lower if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administ@@ ered in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , d@@ osing of 600 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and k@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily that occupy the effectiveness and infin@@ ity of this treatment scheme . &quot;
52 % lower when Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administ@@ ered .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r in Plas@@ ma , which were achieved in combination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) can be administ@@ ered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day . &quot;
&quot; a d@@ osing intake for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to be a con@@ ti@@ ghter monitoring because the effectiveness and in@@ conceivable of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there has been no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study used to use A@@ generative in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but is recommended due to the random@@ ly component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase is at least one hour apart . ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore at gift of r@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ence in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no tin adjustment is required .
the treatment with em@@ avi@@ r@@ ence in combination with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both proteins .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ on to other proteins and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ into the ser@@ um@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r may be lowers .
&quot; if these drugs should be used simultaneously , caution is advisable , since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din because of decreased / possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ ma will be less effective . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical surveillance should be made , as an accurate forecast of the combination of the combination of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous gift of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to a rise in Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ zentr@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to 193 % and thus to a rise in with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin associated side effects .
&quot; when it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ generative is to be administ@@ ered , to a reduction in dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with a@@ generative in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , however the plas@@ ma @-@ level of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of C@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in the plas@@ ma for the value , which was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ate , Hem@@ mer or in@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied if they are applied together with A@@ generative disorders , possibly cause interactions . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be combined on toxic reactions which are linked to these drugs , if they are applied in combination with gener@@ osity . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other proteins , it is advisable that Ant@@ azi@@ da should not be taken at the same time as an@@ generative , as it may come to res@@ or@@ atory disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ s@@ va , which are known as an enzy@@ mes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ stru@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r can lead to a hum@@ ili@@ ation of the plas@@ mas@@ onry of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium bin@@ ders like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pin , ni@@ di@@ pin , N@@ iz@@ di@@ pin , N@@ iz@@ di@@ pin , N@@ iz@@ di@@ pin , N@@ iz@@ di@@ pin , and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and tox@@ icity of these drugs . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ generative can increase their plas@@ ma concentration and reinforce with PD@@ E@@ 5 @-@ inhibit@@ ors associated with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in a clinical study where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules are given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to pro@@ b@@ anden ( 90 % intensity ) ( 90 % -@@ con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) .
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous gift of A@@ generative with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , unless the possible benefits of treatment is the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ tical _ stero@@ ids ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ bi@@ atin , their metabolism is greatly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are distinctive increases of the plas@@ mas@@ onry at simultaneous administration of A@@ generative . &quot;
&quot; since Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ v@@ ic increase in this H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to My@@ op@@ athy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended for a common monitoring of the therapeutic concentr@@ ations to stabili@@ ze the mirror , since the plas@@ ma concentration of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied together with oral in@@ perceived h@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while respecting simultaneous use of A@@ generative Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution . &quot;
&quot; data for simultaneous use of par@@ ental Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other protein levels , indicating a possible increase in the plas@@ mas@@ onry from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to add 3 to 4 times . &quot;
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ on is administ@@ ered along with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ v@@ ets symptoms , particularly if there is also a low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the maximum limited number of historic compar@@ isons , no recommendation may be given , like the Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose to adapt , when Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ on . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ al anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ generative , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ mal@@ ised rati@@ o ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of the anti @-@ thro@@ wer effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive is not fores@@ ee@@ able ; therefore alternative methods are recommended for receptions .
a careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for simultaneous gift of A@@ generative or ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug can only be applied for careful un@@ considering of the potential usage for the mother compared to the possible risks to fet@@ us . &quot;

the further development of the descendants including fer@@ til@@ isation and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r .
the thought@@ fulness of A@@ generative was examined in adults and in children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most associated with the A@@ generative treatment associated side effects were slightly to moderate , entered early on and led rarely to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events is not clear whether in connection with the intake of A@@ generative or another at the same time , whether they are applied to HIV treatment . &quot;
&quot; most of the below side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with Prot@@ eas@@ ags did not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg A@@ generative twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( degrees 2 to 4 ) , which were used by the investig@@ ators than in connection with the study medicine , and with more than 1 % of the patients were performed , as well as under the treatment of rising laboratory changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy has been associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ) in HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of periph@@ er@@ ous and vis@@ cer@@ eal fat tissues , hyper@@ trop@@ y of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ vi@@ cal fats . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ ally non @-@ treated persons , who had been treated with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ dov@@ et@@ ine over a mean period of 36 weeks , was only observed ( l@@ aps ) ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;

&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was tested both in ak@@ ut and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ atable cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as in periph@@ eral hem@@ tic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute cells and amounts to 0.12 µ@@ M in chronic cells .
the connection between the activity of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ ally , not previously @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages have been observed - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ed treatment systems - the mut@@ ations described above rarely observed . &quot;

&quot; a otyp@@ ical analysis of the insul@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , where a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure entered within the 59 concluded with proteins that were not pre @-@ treated patients who were similar to those in adults . &quot;

&quot; the conclusions with regard to the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to enable the current inter@@ pret@@ ations systems to analyze the results of Resi@@ sten@@ z@@ est tests . &quot;
on ph@@ er@@ otyp@@ ical resistance @-@ based analysis clin@@ ically vali@@ ant inter@@ pret@@ ations systems can be applied in connection with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to an assessment of activity of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ ant @-@ resist@@ ors isol@@ ates .
companies that sell diagnostic Resi@@ sten@@ si@@ ders have developed clin@@ ically @-@ ph@@ än@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( parti@@ tions ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a Resi@@ dent test .
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cru@@ de resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ eas@@ ags for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r Resi@@ sten@@ z@@ pf@@ ade either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ ated patients , those with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ equ@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , strings and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) and ti@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 Isol@@ ate ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against several other proteins of gender @-@ resistant insulation ; obtaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and from type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
the early breaking @-@ off therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in boundaries which can affect the following treatment .
&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of A@@ generative in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study ( Vir@@ us@@ last &gt; 1000 copies / ml ) either with a PI , mostly with low @-@ coated k@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; sixty pounds ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ generative , at least another PI and at least one NR@@ TI were included in the part study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ har@@ ness of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as compared to the So@@ C @-@ PI Group with regard to the So@@ C @-@ PI Group in regard to the So@@ C @-@ PI Group in the Plas@@ ma ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in Plas@@ ma after 16 weeks in a non @-@ smoking area of 0.@@ 4@@ log@@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of un@@ geb@@ oo@@ st@@ ained d@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controll@@ able studies with a total of 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ generative solution to take and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice a day . &quot;
it was not given any low do@@ si@@ zed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI @-@ treated patients had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) which were administ@@ ered along with A@@ generative NR@@ LA .
after 48 weeks about 25 % of the patients included a plas@@ ma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell count from 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the starting point .
&quot; 19 Basi@@ cs to this data should be considered during treatment optim@@ isation , with PI forward @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; gener@@ osity into consideration . &quot;
&quot; for oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) is up to maximum Ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for solving . &quot;
5@@ 08 % increase in contrast to 30 % by contrast to 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) administ@@ ered together with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; the administration of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r with a meal guides up to 25 % of the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration of the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake is the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves a vast distribution of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the substance in plas@@ ma , with the quantity of un@@ common am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ common am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components may vary depending on the overall drug industry in the ste@@ ady State on the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ serts , or inhi@@ bits a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , be administ@@ ered with caution when they are given simultaneously with A@@ generative ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ generative capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r @-@ exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is out of the solution 14 % less bi@@ ble version than out of the capsules ; therefore , A@@ generative solution and A@@ generative capsules are not inter@@ change@@ able on a milli@@ gram@@ m@@ base . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neglected , therefore the impact of a kidney failure to the Eli@@ mination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these therapy schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r @-@ plas@@ mas@@ ons comparable to those that are obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous closure of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for can@@ ogen@@ eit@@ y with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats stood in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ atic cellular enzy@@ ome in doses , the exposure to the 2 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - triple ( rat ) of exposure to 1200 mg of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ atic cell@@ ul@@ ary aden@@ ome and Car@@ cin@@ oma still has not been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for the human being is unclear .
&quot; however , from the present exposure data at the people , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application , however , take little evidence of the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity testing , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test in human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes included , was am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r or genital mu@@ x@@ ic . &quot;
this liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by means of A@@ ST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , there have been no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients , neither during administration of A@@ generative or after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies for tox@@ icity in juven@@ iles were treated with juven@@ iles at an age of 4 days , demonstrated both in control and with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in a system@@ ic plas@@ ma Ex@@ pos@@ ure , which was significant below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage , however , were observed a number of low @-@ level changes including Th@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and low @-@ low skel@@ eton , which point out to a delay . &quot;
&quot; 24 When A@@ generative capsules are used without the ampli@@ fic@@ tive addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ generative ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generative capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application is said to be treated with caution in patients with de@@ w@@ aking or mild liver dis@@ ruption with caution in patients with severe liver inter@@ ruption . ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening unwanted effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Nor@@ mal@@ ised rati@@ o ) , methods are available for determining the substance concentration . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generative should be set in duration 27 when a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the vei@@ led are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk for li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y has been associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug dependent factors such as a longer continuous anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a resistance development .
5@@ 08 % increase , for C@@ max by contrast to 30 % lower if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administ@@ ered in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r in Plas@@ ma , which were achieved in combination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) can be administ@@ ered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day . &quot;
&quot; a d@@ osing intake for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to be a con@@ ti@@ ghter monitoring because the effectiveness and in@@ conceivable of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with em@@ avi@@ r@@ ence in combination with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both proteins .
&quot; if these drugs are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical surveillance should be made , as an accurate forecast of the combination of the combination of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ generative causes , becomes a reduction in dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium bin@@ ders like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pin , ni@@ di@@ pin , N@@ iz@@ di@@ pin , N@@ iz@@ di@@ pin , and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and tox@@ icity of these drugs . &quot;
in a clinical study where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules are given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to pro@@ b@@ anden ( 90 % intensity ) ( 90 % -@@ con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) .
&quot; with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ al anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ generative , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ mal@@ ised rati@@ o ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of the anti @-@ thro@@ wer effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl@@ es@@ tradi@@ ol plus 1,0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r by 22 % b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug can only be applied for careful un@@ considering of the potential usage for the mother compared to the possible risks to the fet@@ us . &quot;
a re@@ production study of pregnant rats which was administ@@ ered by the entry into the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . during the lac@@ tation period was a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight in the offspring .
the thought@@ fulness of A@@ generative was examined in adults and in children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is able to observe signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary suppor@@ tive policies . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was tested both in ak@@ ut and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ atable cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral hem@@ tic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is located in the range from 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute cells and amounts to 2 µ@@ M in chronic in@@ infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against several other proteins of gender @-@ resistant insulation ; obtaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and from type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on this data should be considered during treatment optim@@ isation , with PI pre@@ valent children of the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; gener@@ osity into consideration . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ common am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components may vary depending on the overall drug industry in the ste@@ ady State on the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ serts , or inhi@@ bits a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , be administ@@ ered with caution when they are given simultaneously with A@@ generative ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the impact of an kidney failure is likely to be low on the Eli@@ mination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on can@@ ogen@@ eit@@ y with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats appear in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ atic cellular aden@@ ome in dos@@ ages ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - triple ( rat ) the exposure of 1200 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ular aden@@ ome and Car@@ cin@@ oma still has not been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for the human being is unclear .
&quot; however , from the present exposure data at the people , both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application , there are little evidence of the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity testing , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test in human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes included , was am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r or genital mu@@ x@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; studies for tox@@ icity in juven@@ iles were treated with juven@@ iles at an age of 4 days , demonstrated both in control and with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these results can be ex@@ clude that in bul@@ ls the Met@@ abol@@ ism does not yet fully mature so that Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the wording ( z ) .
&quot; A@@ generative solution for inclusion is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , proteins , adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ generative solution to in@@ take was not occupied with the patients treated with PI @-@ treated patients with PI @-@ treated patients . &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a solution to income is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore these are A@@ generative capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis not ex@@ change@@ able ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with the intake of the solution to take ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for a generative solution is 17 mg ( 1,@@ 1 ml ) Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , there must be no tin recommendations for the simultaneous application of A@@ generative solution to inser@@ ting and low do@@ si@@ fied k@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided these combination with these patient groups . &quot;
although a dosage adjustment for am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is not necessary for am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is an application of A@@ generative solution for taking patients with kidney failure . ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col is A@@ generative solution for taking children and children under 4 years , pregnant women with reduced liver function or liver fail and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
the simultaneous administration may lead to a com@@ peti@@ tive in@@ hibition of the met@@ abolic isation of these medicines and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening unwanted effects such as cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ generative or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with A@@ generative is not preventing the risk 47 of an transfer of HIV to others through sexual contact or contam@@ ination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening unwanted effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Nor@@ mal@@ ised rati@@ o ) , methods are available for determining the substance concentration . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generative should be set in a duration when a rash may be accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the vei@@ led are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk for li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y has been associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with pharmaceutical - 49 depending factors , as a longer continuous anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; with h@@ ash@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ers , reports of an increase in ble@@ eding including spontaneous hem@@ at@@ ut@@ aner hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ ws . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a resistance development .
5@@ 08 % increase , for C@@ max by contrast to 30 % lower if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administ@@ ered in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ generative can increase their plas@@ ma concentration and lead to PD@@ E@@ 5 @-@ inhibit@@ ors associated with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
based on data on 54 other CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors are expected to be significantly higher plastic concentration by Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ on .
&quot; the potential risk to man is not known as &quot; &quot; A@@ generative solution to in@@ ges@@ tion may not be applied due to potential toxic reactions of Fet@@ us to the &quot; &quot; prop@@ ylene gly@@ col &quot; &quot; ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the milk , Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven in the milk , it is not known whether Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r are overweight in people into the breast milk . &quot;
a re@@ production study of pregnant rats which was administ@@ ered by the entry into the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . during the lac@@ tation period was a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight in the offspring .
the thought@@ fulness of A@@ generative was examined in adults and in children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in many of these events is not clear whether in connection with the intake of A@@ generative or another at the same time , whether they are applied to HIV treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ ally , not previously @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages have been observed - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ed treatment systems - the mut@@ ations described above rarely observed . &quot;

&quot; the practic@@ ality and the duration of treatment with Al@@ dara depend on the disease of treatment : • At a maximum of 16 weeks in the genital area , Al@@ dara is six times weekly five times weekly during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks break between the treatment of cycles , three times weekly . &quot;
the cream stand in front of the bed@@ time thin @-@ lay@@ ered on the affected skin surfaces so that they remain enough for a long time ( approximately eight hours ) on the skin before they washed away .
in all studies Al@@ dara was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( same cream but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dara was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area each 16 weeks .
the main inde@@ er for the effectiveness was the number of patients with full cooling of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dara was also examined on 7@@ 24 patients with small b@@ umps in two studies in which patients were treated for six weeks or plac@@ ebo or plac@@ ebo either daily or five times weekly .
the main inde@@ er for the effectiveness was the number of patients with full precip@@ itation of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara was also tested in two studies in a total of 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ants .
in all studies Al@@ dara was more effective than plac@@ ebo . • When treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area was treated 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients compared to 80 % in comparison to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dara ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of cream ( pain or itch ) .
&quot; clinical typical , not hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , not hyper@@ trop@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osen ( A@@ KS ) on the face or on the sc@@ alp at immun@@ ology of immun@@ otherapy , if the size or the number of l@@ esi@@ ons limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy , and other top@@ ical treatments can be performed or less appropriate . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before the refu@@ ge take up and 6 to 10 hours long on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream is so long to continue , until all the s@@ war@@ nings have disappeared in genital or peri@@ anal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
a break in the treatment described above should be weigh@@ ed when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if in the treatment field a infection is observed .
&quot; if at follow @-@ up investigation of 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the patients treated only incomplete , another treatment should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose was dropped , the patient lifts the cream as soon as he / she noticed this and then continue with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream is to wear in a thin layer and to rub@@ bing the infected skin area until the Cre@@ am is completely de@@ duc@@ ted .
&quot; in these patients , it should be provided with such treatment between the benefit of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot;
it should take place in these patients with an en@@ coding between the benefits of treatment with i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ @-@ rep@@ lication or gr@@ aft versus @-@ host@@ - reaction associated risk .
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily disp@@ osi@@ tions have been carried out , two cases of severe ph@@ im@@ osis and a case with one to the circum@@ c@@ ision leading stri@@ ps observed . &quot;
during an application of i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses there is an increased risk to severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases have also observed heavy local skin irrit@@ ation that made a treatment necessary and / or to temporary physical impair@@ ment .
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women had trouble passing urine , which made an emergency cath@@ eter and a treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream immediately following a treatment with other calibr@@ ated appli@@ ences in genital war@@ nings in genital and peri@@ anal area , there are no clinical experience until now . &quot;
limited data suggest a higher rate of events reduction in HIV positive patients ; I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream in this patient group in regards to the elimination of the F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts however showed a lower efficacy .
&quot; the treatment of the Bas@@ que cell with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od within 1 cm to the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line has not been studied . &quot;
local se@@ ap@@ tions are common but the intensity of these reactions occur in general during therapy or the reactions are going back after the treatment with i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the discomfort of the patient , or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin interactions , a treatment of treatment can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical results of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; there is currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of over 36 months after the treatment , should be considered to be considered with super@@ fic@@ iency bases . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ C@@ s are not clinical experience , so the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours . &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of response to the i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od therapy .
i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od has not been studied for the treatment of ac@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ants in eyel@@ ids inside the nose or the ears or on the lip@@ se within the lip@@ pot .
it is only very limited data on the application of i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od for the treatment of accredited ker@@ at@@ ants to anatom@@ ical points outside of the face and the sc@@ alp .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ent Ker@@ at@@ ose on the under@@ poor and hands support the effectiveness in this application case , therefore a such application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local cat@@ ching actions often appear on , but these reactions tend to take effect in the course of the therapy of intensity or go back after lowering the therapy with i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local front parties cause large discomfort or are very strong , the treatment can be exposed for several days . &quot;
the data of an open clinical trial goes out that patients with more than 8 AK@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons showed a less complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
&quot; because of the immune @-@ stimulating characteristics should be applied i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od creams with caution in patients , which received an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;

in clinical studies on the examination of the application of i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od for the treatment of accredited Ker@@ at@@ ose , Alo@@ pe@@ zie with a frequency of 0.3 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) was found at the treatment of treatment or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the acci@@ dental record of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags could lead to nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ al@@ gi@@ as and fever . &quot;
the clin@@ ically weight@@ y side effect that occurred after several or@@ ic cans of &gt; 200 mg consisted in Hyp@@ ot@@ ony that norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid transmission .

in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in regards to a complete cooling of the F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts was clearly superior to a plac@@ ebo treatment after 16 weeks of a plac@@ ebo treatment .
at 60 % of a total of 119 with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od therapy treatments completely off ; this was at 20 % of the 105 with plac@@ ebo therapies in the case ( 95 % CI ) :

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzy@@ mes therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ des I ( M@@ PS I ; α @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non neurological manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms which are not associated with brain or nerves in connection ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ o@@ gly@@ kan@@ e , g@@ ags ) will not be dis@@ assembled and thus s@@ ells in most organs in the body and those ash@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; the following no neurological symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements complic@@ ate , decreased lung cancer , cardi@@ ac and austerity . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edit@@ ary diseases .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ ating units , and patients may require corresponding medicines to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; in the study mainly the security of the drug has been investigated , however , it was also tested its effectiveness ( by promoting its effect regarding the reduction of the G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in the urine and regarding the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me the G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in the urine of about 60 % , and half of the children treated as a normal great liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , stomach pain ( joint pain ) , ar@@ thr@@ ush , pain , fever and reactions to the inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a scanning size of pul@@ mon@@ ary function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ die ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and sho@@ ok . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may be used in patients that may possibly have greatly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other ingredients ( an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) that is not used .
&quot; the European Drug Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will receive all new information each year , which may possibly be known to examine and update this summary . &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is obtained patients who receive Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to the inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies .
June 2003 the European Commission of Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. shared a permit for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mam@@ mal @-@ Zell@@ kultur@@ en ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , E@@ ven@@ stock of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is the long @-@ term enzy@@ mes in patients with secured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) , in order to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor that has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edit@@ ary substance diseases .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be when the patient is toler@@ ated all 15 minutes in a single step to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no d@@ osing scheme can be recommended .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency was not determined and for these patients no d@@ osing scheme can be recommended .
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me patients may develop infectious reactions , which are defined as any related side @-@ effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be monitored eng@@ ul@@ ously monitored and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should only be made available in an appropriate clinical environment , in the rein@@ forcement facilities for medical emergen@@ cies immediately . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase @-@ 3 study , it is expected to form almost all patients Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from treatment . &quot;
patients to develop anti@@ body or symptoms of infectious diseases must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , has to be cau@@ tious due to the theoretical risk of an over@@ sensitivity reaction after an inter@@ ruption of treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of inf@@ usion using medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tika ) to minimize the potential occurrence @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in the event of a slight or medium @-@ heavy inf@@ usion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen will be weigh@@ ed and / or reducing the inf@@ usion rate to the half of the inf@@ usion rate , in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , severe inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction must be stopped until the symptoms are thrown into decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is considering . &quot;
inf@@ usion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred to be resum@@ ed .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular recording of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not leave a direct or indirect effect on pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns which were exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via the milk of milk , is recommended , while the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me is not too silent . &quot;
&quot; the side effects in clinical trials were introduced mainly as inf@@ usion related reactions , which were observed at 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) . &quot;
unwanted drugs related drugs related to Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms that have been observed during phase 3 study and its extension at a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in a treatment of 45 years of age groups : very common ( &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 0 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I condi@@ tional participation of the upper respir@@ atory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history occurred in addition severe reaction , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ atory and facial treatments ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children of un@@ desired pharmaceutical impacts related to Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me , who were reported in a Ph@@ as@@ - 2 @-@ study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with overwhel@@ m@@ ingly severe circulation and treatment of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg of intraven@@ ous once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 e / kg of intraven@@ ous once weekly , 200 e / kg of intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg of intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; for most patients it occurred within 3 months after the treatment of the treatment of a ser@@ otonin version , whereby the patients aged under the age of 5 occurred within 5 years compared to a ser@@ otonin version ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; by the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature exp@@ ul@@ sion from the study ) , at 13 / 45 patients no prescribed si@@ lic@@ able antibodies , including 3 patients when it has never been to Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version . &quot;
&quot; patients with error by low antibodies to the low level of antibodies in the resin , while in patients with high antibodies to determine a variable reduction of g@@ AG in the har@@ n . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ally up to low neutr@@ ality inhibit@@ ors effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ idal activity in vit@@ ro which seemed to imp@@ air the clinical effectiveness and / or reducing G@@ AG in the har@@ n .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not seem to stand in connection with the incidence of unwanted drugs , even though the occurrence of undes@@ irable drug interactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the ration@@ ale for the enzy@@ mes therapy is in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the acoustic sub@@ str@@ ate and the prevention of a further accumulation of sufficient recovery of the enzy@@ mes .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and cells into the ly@@ sis , most likely via cre@@ osis @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms were examined in a random@@ ized , double fl@@ ea , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited patients from the study , the majority of patients were seen from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient pointed to the heavy phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an for@@ ci@@ zed exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary outcomes for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute walking test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label renewal study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients were treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients compared to the plac@@ ebo group , an improvement in the lung function and the de@@ ability to display in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in an open renewal study , an improvement and / or maintaining these effects from up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me group , as follows from the following table . &quot;
the decrease of the expected percentage of the FE@@ V is not significant over this period of clin@@ ically and the absolute lung vol@@ um@@ ina increased further proportional to the height of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a hep@@ at@@ y , on the treatment achieved by 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal living room size . &quot;
within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was established until the study &apos;s degree remained constant .
&quot; regarding the heter@@ ogen@@ eous path@@ ology between patients , which has been taken into account for five patients ( 58 % ) , generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
it became one @-@ year @-@ year open phase @-@ 2 study conducted in which primarily the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms were examined at 20 patients who were at the time of their admission to the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with severe dis@@ continued form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased AG@@ AG@@ - mirror in the resin in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 e / kg .
&quot; in the case of several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight increase ( n = 3 ) was established after the Z @-@ Score for this age group , the younger patients with the heavy duty cycle ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with moderate ag@@ rap@@ port , whereas in older patients with severe dis@@ continued form were only limited or no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
in a phase @-@ 4 study exam@@ inations were conducted on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me d@@ osing schem@@ ata on the G@@ AG mirror in the resin , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walking test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg of intraven@@ ous once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 e / kg of intraven@@ ous once weekly , 200 e / kg of intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg of intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the d@@ osing scheme with 200 e / kg of intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks may present in patients , the difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions , a reasonable alternative ; however , is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two d@@ osing schem@@ ata is equal . &quot;
&quot; the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate all new information , which will evaluate each year , and if required , the summary of the characteristics of the drug is being updated . &quot;
pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged 5 years was similar to older and less affected patients .

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is applied together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( a different drug for cancer ) in patients who have not yet been removed against cancer ( drugs called cancer ) , and mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer is likely to spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ single &quot; lung cancer that is not pregnant at the turn@@ tables . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not previously been dealt with , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously made other chem@@ otherap@@ ies previously used as a sole therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take care of patients during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta as well as fol@@ ate ( a vitamin ) and inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administ@@ ered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , should be given before or after the gift of cis@@ pl@@ atin as well as an anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um &quot; ( drugs against v@@ om@@ iting ) and liqui@@ ds ( to remedy a liquid angel ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood picture changes , or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be up@@ lifted , set or the dose reduces . &quot;
&quot; the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mit has slow@@ ed down the formation of DNA and RNA , and prevents the cells share . &quot;
&quot; the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form goes easier for cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentration of the active form of the drug and a longer time of treatment in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ing Pl@@ ei@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had never received any chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ nuclear lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were treated in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , which previously had previously been treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drugs against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( a further drug with cancer ) , namely both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin were covered by an average of 12,@@ 1 months , compared to 9,@@ 3 months in general administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients having previously received an chemotherapy , the average survival rates associated with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.@@ 3 months , compared with 7.2 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies however , patients were diagnosed in which cancer are not the turn@@ tables , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta for longer transition times than with the compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
September 2004 condemned the European Commission to the company El@@ i Lil@@ ly Ne@@ derland B.@@ V. providing permission for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
any flow @-@ bottle has to be calculated with 4.8 ml 0.@@ 9 % iger @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) - which results a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - S@@ IS is taken from the bottle case and with 0.7 % iger so@@ dium injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) on 100 ml is further dil@@ uted ( see Section 6.6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin as first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ smart bron@@ chi@@ al@@ kar@@ zin@@ ome ( see Section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is shown for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non@@ sensi@@ cal bron@@ chi@@ al ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administ@@ ered as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin amounts to 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as inf@@ usion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - inf@@ usion on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in case of patients with non @-@ German bron@@ chi@@ al@@ kar@@ zin@@ ome , the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administ@@ ered as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment @-@ cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of Hau@@ ters must be given the day before and on the day of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift , as well as on the day after the treatment a cor@@ tico @-@ ster@@ oid . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mit must be taken at least 5 doses of fol@@ ate , and the intake must be continued during the whole treatment of therapy and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage . &quot;
patients also must also receive an in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after each third assignment .
&quot; in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mit , every gift should be created a complete blood @-@ picture , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a Th@@ ro@@ ism . &quot;
the al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( A@@ ST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ an@@ in @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be &lt; 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit value . &quot;
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle a tin @-@ examination must take place under Ber@@ ing the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood balance or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ ical tox@@ icity of the pre@@ - h@@ itting therapy .
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applicable to ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) &gt; C@@ TC degree 2 ble@@ eding .
&quot; should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity &gt; degree 3 ( except neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity ) , the patient has to be interrupted by ALI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA has to be cancelled when patients after 2 dos@@ ages , a hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort at the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity . &quot;
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 year@@ - or in comparison to patients aged 65 years of age .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on in@@ conceivable and effectiveness .
clinical trials were measured in patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of &gt; &gt; 45 ml / min no dosage adjustment necessary for all patients recommended dosage adjustment .
data base in patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not adequate ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients were evaluated with a liver @-@ functional intake of &gt; the 1,5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - border @-@ value and / or tran@@ sam@@ ic values of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit level ( in the presence of liver metastatic breast ) , not specifically in studies . &quot;
patients must be super@@ vised with regard to the Kno@@ - chen@@ mark@@ ers and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mit should not be administ@@ ered to patients before their absolute Ne@@ ut@@ roph@@ y number returns a value of &gt; &gt; &gt; 100,000 cells / mm ³ and the thy@@ ro@@ foam number has reached a value of &gt; &gt; 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a tin @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir &apos;s absolute Ne@@ ut@@ roph@@ y number and maxim@@ ally non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity as observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of the degree 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ mat@@ ured tox@@ icity such as Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degrees 3 / 4 Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was observed if a pre @-@ treatment with fol@@ ate and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
&quot; therefore , all patients need to be dependent on patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fol@@ ate and vitamin B@@ 12 as a prophy@@ lac@@ tic measure for reduction @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must be the simultaneous in@@ con@@ ges@@ tural anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ de@@ - TEN@@ S 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ te ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients , intended for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment , the intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occur , had corresponding risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or Diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant hydr@@ ation - accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space a dra@@ inage of Erg@@ onom@@ ic treatment can be weigh@@ ed before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including M@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ers , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this substance is usually administ@@ ered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated li@@ mp@@ s ( except money fever , this vaccine is con@@ trained ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of an irre@@ ver@@ sible sk@@ etch of the reproductive capacity is made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be informed before the treatment of treatment , advice regarding the sper@@ mat@@ on@@ ation . &quot;
in patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &gt; 80 ml / min ) can lead high doses of non @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ acet@@ yl@@ ic acid in high dosage ( &gt; &gt; 1,3 g daily ) to a decreased pair of effects associated with the consequence of an increased delay of side effects .
therefore caution is advisable when in patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &gt; 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or Ac@@ ic@@ t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ic acid in high dosage .

&quot; since there are no data regarding the transaction potential as N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long semi @-@ time needed like pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or ro@@ fec@@ ox@@ ib , the simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment should be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - . &quot;
&quot; the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the status status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ mal@@ ised rati@@ o ) , when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; there are no data for using P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed case in case of pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - and an@@ tim@@ it@@ ol@@ ites are expected to be an application in the pregnancy serious faul@@ ty effects . &quot;
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mit should not be applied during pregnancy except when it is demanding and careful weighing of the farm for the mother and the risk to the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; since the possibility of an irre@@ ver@@ sible sk@@ etch of the reproductive capacity is made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be informed prior to the treatment of treatment , advice regarding the sper@@ mak@@ es@@ pi@@ vie@@ war@@ ps . &quot;

&quot; it must also be used in case of patients suffering from a long @-@ term Mal@@ absor@@ bing fic@@ iency Syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients from the diges@@ tive tract ) or to chol@@ est@@ ase ( a liver disease ) suffer , and in pregnant or nursing mothers . &quot;

alli is used to weight reduction in adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index @-@ Index BM@@ I &gt; 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in combination with a slightly hypo@@ cal@@ or@@ ical diet .
&quot; alli must not be used by children and young people under 18 , because not enough data on effectiveness and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , Or@@ li@@ stat however only minimal res@@ or@@ bi@@ ert is only minimal and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other components • simultaneous treatment with Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Chron@@ icle ( see Section 4.6 ) • Peri@@ od treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ al anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
the lik@@ eli@@ hood of the awakening gast@@ ro@@ un@@ al symptoms ( see Section 4.8 ) can increase if alli made together with a fat meal or fet@@ ters diet .
&quot; since the weight @-@ reduction in diabetes can be carried out with improved met@@ abolic control , patients should consult a medication against diabetes , before beginning a therapy with alli made a doctor or a pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic may be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; patients , the alli as well as drugs against hyper@@ tension or increased cholesterol levels should consult their physician or pharmac@@ ists , whether the dosage must be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ating measures , in order to bow the possible contrac@@ eption of the or@@ al contrac@@ eption ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study on inter@@ dependen@@ ces of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of Or@@ li@@ stat and Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in , a waste of Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ al anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant in combination with Or@@ li@@ stat , the Quick values could be influenced ( internationally norm@@ ated rati@@ o , IN@@ R ) ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with Or@@ li@@ stat , the concentr@@ ations of vitamins A , D , E and K and the beta car@@ ot@@ ins are in the standard . &quot;
&quot; however , the patient should be advised to take a compl@@ ementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure sufficient vit@@ amine intake ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of a one @-@ Mal@@ d@@ osis A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers , which at the same time Or@@ li@@ stat received , a low value of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ zentr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies did not show any direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of Or@@ li@@ stat are mainly gast@@ ro@@ un@@ inal nature and depend on the pharmac@@ ological effects of the medication by means , since absorption of bi@@ ases is prevented . &quot;
the gast@@ ro@@ un@@ inal side effects have been established from clinical trials with Or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg for a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easy and temporary .
&quot; the differences are defined as follows : very common ( &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( &gt; &gt; &gt; / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data not transfer@@ able ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of the familiar side effects that have been established after the launch of Or@@ li@@ stat , is not known as these events were voluntarily reported from a population of un@@ certain magnitude . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with alli made with regard to possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ un@@ inal side effects can lead .
individual doses of 800 mg Or@@ li@@ stat and multi @-@ capacity of up to 400 mg three times a day were administ@@ ered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight specimens that occurred over a period of 15 days without a significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of the cases reported by Or@@ li@@ stat @-@ over@@ dose , either side effects or similar effects were reported in the recommended dose of Or@@ li@@ stat . &quot;
&quot; based on investigations on humans and animals can be attributed from a quick rep@@ lication of any system@@ ic effects , which are due to the li@@ pas@@ ing properties of Or@@ li@@ stat . &quot;
the therapeutic effect sets in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper d@@ une @-@ living co@@ atings in the active ser@@ ene rest of the g@@ astr@@ al and pan@@ atic li@@ pas@@ en .
&quot; clinical trials has been derived that 60 mg Or@@ li@@ stat , three times daily , absorption of approximately 25 % of the food is blocked . &quot;
&quot; two double fl@@ ea , random@@ ized , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I &gt; 28 kg / m2 occupy the effectiveness of 60 mg Or@@ li@@ stat , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fet@@ al nutrition . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameters , the change of body weight compared to the output value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , has been assessed as follows : as a change in the body weight in the study shift ( table 1 ) and as percentage of those who have lost over 10 % of their output weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction has been observed over 12 months , the greatest weight@@ loss in the first six months has been observed . &quot;
the average change in the overall cholester@@ in was with Or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg -@@ 2.8 % ( output worth 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.9 % ( output worth 5.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of the L@@ DL cholesterol amo@@ unted to Or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( cur@@ ly value dri@@ m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 3.6 % ( output worth 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; in the wa@@ ist , the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with Or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg ( output value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3,@@ 6 cm ( output worth 10@@ 3,5 cm ) . &quot;
plas@@ tic@@ on@@ cent@@ ations of not met@@ abo@@ li@@ fied Or@@ li@@ stat were 8 hours following the or@@ als of 360 mg Or@@ li@@ stat does not measurable ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .

&quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased through the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a drug , which can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um ) . &quot;
the application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended because the effects in this age group is not enough information .
&quot; this means that the active ingredient of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adults , the Chem@@ ists received strong or excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are 59 % of the patients treated with alo@@ xi in 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron treated patients ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chemotherapy , the trigger trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are showed 81 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of the patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values at 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .

Alo@@ xi is indi@@ ces : the prevention of acute nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting at strongly em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy due to cancer prevention and v@@ om@@ iting at uni@@ on@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy due to cancer prevention .
&quot; the effectiveness of alo@@ xi on prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , which is in@@ duced by a strongly em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy can be reinforced by adding a given cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; as Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron extend the Dick@@ dar@@ mp@@ ass@@ age , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of subsidi@@ zing I@@ le@@ us after inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advisable with drugs which extend the Q@@ T @-@ Inter@@ v@@ all or in patients with which Q@@ t- interval is extended or that tend to be one of such an extender . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with an additional chemotherapy medicine , Alo@@ xi in days after chemotherapy is not used to prevent nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;

&quot; in a population based pharmac@@ opo@@ etic analysis , it has been shown that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ on and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ id@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Chin@@ a@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ sh@@ alin and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) have no significant impact on the clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experience to the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies are not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied in pregnant , unless it is considered by the treating physicians than necessary . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ gram to follow @-@ up side effects ( a total of 633 patients ) which were at least possibly with alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity and reactions at the administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were given in post @-@ marketing experience . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage showed similar frequencies of unwanted events , as in the other d@@ osing groups , there were no dose @-@ active relationships . &quot;
&quot; there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies conducted because of the large distribution volume , however , there is probably no effective therapy for an al@@ chem@@ ist over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ized double @-@ ind@@ studies were given a total of 1,@@ 132 patients having a moderate chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2 , car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.@@ 3 hours ) , which was given on day 1 without D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ on intraven@@ ously . &quot;

&quot; according to the findings , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the c@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation involved and to extend the duration of the shareholder potential . &quot;
&quot; the study conducted by 221 healthy volunteers were the assessment of the E@@ KG effects of i.@@ v. administ@@ ered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single @-@ osen of 0,25 s , 0,75 and 51 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follows an extensive Eli@@ mination from the body with an average season half @-@ time period about 40 hours .
the average maximum Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ zentr@@ ation ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional to the entire dosage range of 0,@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients . &quot;

&quot; from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that once again a daily gi@@ ver of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron had comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C0@@ - ∞ ) with the following a non @-@ recur@@ ring administration of 0,75 mg was comparable ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the use of 0,75 mg higher . &quot;
around 40 % will be eliminated via the kid@@ neys and about another 50 % will be transformed into two primary met@@ abolic paras@@ ites which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .

after a unique intraven@@ ous bol@@ tion in healthy was the overall body of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
&quot; although in patients with severe liver inter@@ rup@@ ting the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ f@@ tzeit , and the average system@@ ic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increased , but a reduction in the dose is therefore not justified . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that can be seen as sufficiently above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for the clinical use . &quot;

&quot; June 2006 , the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ s ( CH@@ MP ) passed a negative value in which the failure of the approval of the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C is recommended using Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that Alph@@ eon is similar to a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same arz@@ t@@ ally effective component , which is already approved in the EU ( also &quot; &quot; reference frequency . &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ prolonged ) hepatitis C ( one by virus infection .
&quot; for a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic examination the liver tissue indicates , moreover , the values of liver enzy@@ mes Al@@ an@@ in@@ - Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increases in the blood ab@@ normal . &quot;
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of the substance .
&quot; the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon placed data that over@@ take the comparison of Alph@@ eon with ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , effectiveness , safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the effectiveness of Alph@@ eon was compared to the effectiveness of the reference to 455 patients . &quot;
&quot; in the study , how many patients were measured after 12 from a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of treatment on the drug ( i.e. there are no indication of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;

&quot; in addition , concerns have expressed concerns that the data on the stability of the substance and the drug is not sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , which spoke to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical trial . &quot;
&quot; after the cess@@ ation of the treatment with Alph@@ eon fl@@ amm@@ ite the disease again in more patients than in the reference frequency ; moreover , al@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the test has been introduced in the study to investigate the question , to what extent the medication is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it may be applied to the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a with cruci@@ fied skin infection ) and small in@@ infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ - or chi@@ ev@@ ils ) , sc@@ opes and paraly@@ zed wo@@ unds . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go is not intended to treat infections , evidence or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ idal resistant St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go against these kinds of infections may not be affected . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but patients under the age of 18 may not be considered 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient is not talking to the treatment two or three days , the doctor should study the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
&quot; it works by blocking the bacterial reef cells ( the parts of the bacterial cells , where proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria . &quot;
&quot; the main inde@@ er of the effectiveness was in all five studies of the patients , whose infection was caused by the end of the treatment . &quot;
119 ( 8@@ 5.3 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under plac@@ ebo spoke to the treatment .
&quot; during the treatment of infected Hau@@ ges , Al@@ tar@@ go and Cef@@ al@@ exin relate : if the results of both studies were raised in Hau@@ tes , spoke about 90 % of the patients of both groups . &quot;
&quot; however in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( eit@@ ful cav@@ ity in the body tissues ) or of infections that have been caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a maturity of the order .
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ s ( CH@@ MP ) led to the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in the course @-@ treatment of the following super@@ ficial rash compared to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • in@@ fied small in@@ serts , sc@@ opes or paraly@@ zed wo@@ unds . &quot;
May 2007 the European Commission shared the G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . appro@@ ve of the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients who show no improvement within two or three days are to be examined and considered a alternative therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the event of raising awareness or severe local irrit@@ ation by the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in sal@@ be , the treatment is dis@@ continued , the sal@@ be carefully ab@@ usive and proper alternative therapy of the infection can be started . &quot;
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in should not be used to treat infections where MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogen or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
clinical trials included in secondary wo@@ unds was the effectiveness of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in in patients with infections that caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resist@@ ent St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were insufficient .
alternative therapy is supposed to be considered when after an 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or a deterioration of the infected passage .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in and other top@@ ical means at the same skin surface is not tested and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the small plas@@ ma concentration , which have been reached when people after top@@ ical application on shi@@ el@@ ced skin or infected super@@ ficial wo@@ unds , is a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After simultaneous gift of 2 @-@ times 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in sal@@ be on shi@@ el@@ ced skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dos@@ ages cannot be considered required when top@@ ical ret@@ ali@@ am@@ ul@@ in is used during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproduction x@@ icity to oral intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement on the birth and the sol@@ dering / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indic@@ ative and the application of ret@@ ap@@ ul@@ ul@@ in the gift of a system@@ ic antibiotic .
&quot; when deciding whether or breast@@ feeding continues , or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go will be continued / termin@@ ated , is between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for inf@@ ant and the benefit of the al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials to 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial rash , the Al@@ tar@@ go , was the most commonly reported ann@@ ex@@ ation of irrit@@ ation at the administration , which concerned about 1 % of the patient . &quot;

the action mechanism of retreat by Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in is based on selective inhibit@@ ors of the bacterial protein synthesis through interaction with a particular relation of the 50@@ s sub @-@ unit of the bacter@@ i@@ al Ri@@ bos@@ oms which differs from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti @-@ bacterial substances .
data suggest that the Bin@@ ding office ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 involved and is located in the area of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ alen P @-@ Bin@@ ding office and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ as@@ e@@ Centre .

&quot; on the basis of local prevalence of resistance , the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in at least some infectious forms appear , should be pursued a consultation by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in opposite S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates are sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the case of failure to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults was brought to 1 % ret@@ ali@@ am@@ ul@@ in sal@@ be daily under oc@@ clusi@@ on on intact and up@@ ted skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , the 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in Sal@@ be received twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected persons , individual Plas@@ map@@ ro@@ ben were obtained . &quot;
the sampling took place on the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients in front of the medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual system inclusion at the people after top@@ ical application of 1 % of sal@@ be to 200 c@@ m2 de@@ duc@@ ted skin ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the ret@@ ru@@ am@@ ul@@ in IC@@ 50 for the p@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is intended to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases which apply the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years which are not im@@ mu@@ n against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of one of two doses of existing vaccines , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix must be used only when the immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that which can be led out of two doses , existing vaccines . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose is desired against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
&quot; vaccines contribute by bringing the immune system ( the natural def@@ ying of the body ) , &quot; as it can fight against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after having received the human vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the virus and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients such as that since 1996 approved vaccine Twin@@ rix adults and since 1997 approved vaccine Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
&quot; the three vaccines are applied to the protection against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administ@@ ered by three doses of existing vaccines . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data used by the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main inde@@ er for the effectiveness was the share of vacc@@ inated children which had developed a month after the last inj@@ tion of a protective antibodies .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine has been compared to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix led children between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last inj@@ ecting to the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection by Ambi@@ rix was similar to a h@@ exag@@ onal and a 12 @-@ month distance between inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine ) are head@@ aches , appeti@@ sers , pain at the injection , redness , soft@@ ness ( ti@@ redness ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix must be used in patients who may possibly over@@ sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) to the active ingredients that are responding to the other components or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) not to be applied .

&quot; the standardization plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ aker with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose is administ@@ ered at the date of choice and the second dose , between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her , is required for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ ent vaccines or with a combination . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis anti @-@ hepatitis ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis B @-@ A @-@ Virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A @-@ A @-@ Virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vaccines .
&quot; it is not entirely secured , whether immun@@ om@@ able individuals addressed to a Hepatitis A@@ - vaccine would require a refres@@ her as protection , since they are also protected with no longer @-@ evidence antibodies possibly by the immun@@ ologic memory . &quot;
3 As with all inj@@ ections should be available for the rare case of an an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine for medical treatment and monitoring always immediately available .
&quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the Stand@@ ardi@@ um scheme is recommended , the 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ active Hepatitis C @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B. &quot;
&quot; with Hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system , after the pri@@ di@@ mm@@ ag@@ ation may be achieved under circumstances no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies , so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be necessary . &quot;
&quot; as an in@@ tra@@ der@@ mal inj@@ ecting or in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle can lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ lication success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in case of Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ zy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or ble@@ eding disorders , Ambi@@ rix cannot in@@ ject however , since it can occur in these cases of in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular gift . &quot;
if Ambi@@ rix had been administ@@ ered in the form of a separate inj@@ ecting together with a combined Di@@ ph@@ ther@@ ie@@ - , Tet@@ an@@ ophil@@ us St@@ eri@@ ae type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mask ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mask on all anti@@ gens . ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients on immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , or with patients with immune def@@ ective people have to be assumed that possibly not sufficient immune response is achieved . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study that has been conducted with 3 vacc@@ inations of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , swelling , head@@ aches and fever is comparable to the frequency that observed in the former Thi@@ om@@ ers@@ al@@ - and preser@@ v@@ atives vaccine . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , 2029 vacc@@ ination Ambi@@ rix were administ@@ ered in a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to 15 years . &quot;
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix has been compared with the 3 @-@ cans combination .
only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and matri@@ ity on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination Ambi@@ rix which is not on a calculation basis per person .
&quot; pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0,@@ 7 % of the pro@@ b@@ anden , compared to 39.@@ 1 % for the gift of a dose of the 3 @-@ cans combination . &quot;
&quot; after the whole vaccine of 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the promot@@ rix reported the Ambi@@ rix had received over pain , compared to 6@@ 3,@@ 8 % in the promot@@ ers , which had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dos@@ - combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of in@@ tox@@ icity was a pro @-@ band comparable ( that is , compared to the entire vacc@@ cycle of 39.@@ 6 % of the promot@@ ers , the Ambi@@ rix had , compared with a 36.@@ 2 % in the promot@@ ers , which received the 3 @-@ cans combination . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of un@@ ambig@@ uous pain and soft@@ ness was small and comparable to , that was observed after administration of the combination therapy with the 3 @-@ doses of vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;

&quot; the Hepatitis A @-@ virus is usually transmitted by viral food and beverages , but can also be transferred through other ways such as bathing in by de@@ wat@@ ser contaminated waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a blue face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ lowing ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix cannot be completely protected from an infection with Hepatitis A@@ - or hepatitis B virus , even if the whole vaccine has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you are infected / your Child in front of the administration of both vacc@@ ination Ambi@@ rix is already infected with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B @-@ virus ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or ill ) a vaccine may not prevent disorder .
&quot; a protection against other infections that cause the liver compens@@ ate or symptoms , which are similar to those after a Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis infection , cannot be convey@@ ed . &quot;
• If you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express themselves through ju@@ ck@@ r@@ aging skin suggestions , respir@@ atory or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have performed an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you have a serious infection with fever . &quot;
&quot; • If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B , i.e. within 6 months and prior to the administration of the second vacc@@ ination ( i.e. the second vacc@@ ination ) . &quot;
&quot; with a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from an imp@@ ure with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced salary to effective components per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a formal hepatitis A @-@ virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B. &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with reduced salary to effective components is usually administ@@ ered a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccine before completion of the vacc@@ ination .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix will suffer from severe ble@@ eding suffering because of the skin and not in the muscle stimul@@ ated . • if you are weak@@ ened in your child due to illness or treatment in your body or treatment in your body or treatment .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases but the immune response of these persons on vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so a blood test can be required to see how strong the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
&quot; 21 S@@ ign you to your doctor if you are taking further medicines / rede@@ em ( including those that you have received without prescription ) or if you have been administ@@ ered / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated , or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have been administ@@ ered / or this is planned in the near future . &quot;
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate positions and as possible as possible limb@@ s . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix should be administ@@ ered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the response to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix Schw@@ ang@@ eren or imp@@ ending women is not administ@@ ered , unless it is urgent to be vacc@@ inated for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other components by Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , consult with your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs to 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which has been known since issu@@ ing the first permit for the transport agreement , treaties at the CH@@ MP opinion that the benefit @-@ risk @-@ ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix had been launched in intercourse only in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure . &quot;
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective or with hyper@@ ammon@@ al @-@ enc@@ ephal@@ op@@ athy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ium concentration ) in the pre@@ history .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps is divided - split into several items to meals - swal@@ lowed , under the food mixed or over a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ eme ( through the abdom@@ en into the stomach of the stomach ) or a nose @-@ sun ( through the nose in the stomach of the stomach ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a compar@@ ative study , since Am@@ mon@@ aps not with any other treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a search@@ medication , i.e. without an active ingredient ) . &quot;
&quot; amp@@ mon@@ aps can also lead to ap@@ peti@@ tive loss , a ab@@ norm@@ ative inf@@ ect in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , fluid pain , nau@@ sea , sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , rash , un@@ pleas@@ urable body cur@@ se or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ s ( CH@@ MP ) led to the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ aps are effectively prevented from patients with disorders of the ure@@ tic cycle .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was admitted under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; because due to the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine . &quot;
the use is indi@@ ces in all patients in which a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ man@@ gel has already manifest@@ ed in the re @-@ born age ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
&quot; in patients with a delay ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective , which manifes@@ ts itself after the first life of life ) then there is an indication of use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese is a hyper@@ op@@ ul@@ ent end@@ enc@@ ephal@@ op@@ athy . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with slots , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ule form . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose will be individually calculated , taking into account of the protein @-@ toler@@ ance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient . &quot;
&quot; according to recent clinical experience , the normal daily dose so@@ dium poly@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and with grown @-@ growing and adult . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from an earliest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tr@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or argin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day required . &quot;
patients with a gin@@ gi@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must obtain ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.7 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets may not be administ@@ ered patients with slots , as there is a risk to the emergence of Ö@@ soph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a if the tablets do not get immediately into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; every tablet AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium poly@@ yl but@@ yr@@ at , which is the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ sti@@ tious heart in@@ suff@@ iciency or severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency as well as with so@@ dium and oils in clinical conditions .
&quot; as Met@@ abol@@ ism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at across the liver and the kid@@ neys , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency only with extreme caution . &quot;
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore con@@ trained ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; with sub@@ cut@@ ters g@@ abe of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came into a slow@@ down of the neur@@ onal amplifier and an increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; it also found out a delay of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses , and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain , and therefore a disability of brain growth . &quot;
&quot; it could not be established if Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is retired in men into the breast milk , and for that reason is the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during breast@@ feeding period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS in 56 % of patients had at least one unwanted event ( AE ) on and at 78 % of these undes@@ irable events that they were not associated with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS .
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very common ( &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) has been reported by a 18 year old anor@@ ectal patient , which developed a met@@ abolic disorder in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ ebox , rhin@@ oc@@ top@@ en@@ ie , periph@@ ery N@@ europ@@ athy and Pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; an event of an over@@ dose , with an 5 @-@ month old small child , with an acci@@ dentally single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) . &quot;
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed up to 400 mg / kg / day a dose of neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic connection which is contrac@@ ted by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine glut@@ amine that will follow the kid@@ neys .
ru@@ gs seen is Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen ox@@ es ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore considered an altern@@ ate carrier to ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary tract can be accepted that for every gram@@ ms Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
&quot; it is important that the diagnosis was made early and the treatment will start immediately , in order to improve the survival of the experience and the clinical results . &quot;
&quot; the progn@@ osis of the early @-@ mani@@ fold form of the disease with appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ born age was almost always inf@@ ant , and the disease led themselves to the treatment with Per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their sti@@ cking @-@ free analog@@ y within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; by Hä@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis , the util@@ isation of altern@@ ate paths of nit@@ rogen hormone ( so@@ dium hydro@@ chlor@@ ic acid ) , prot@@ ein@@ duced K@@ ost and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to diagnose the survival rate of new sal@@ via at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first life of life ) to increase diseases on 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and the disease is already treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic end enc@@ ephal@@ op@@ athy , but even in these patients it was time with many to spiritual disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a delay in the disease ( including female patients with the heter@@ ogen@@ eous form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ city deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ op@@ ul@@ cer@@ ies but@@ yr@@ at and a prot@@ ein@@ ated diet , was the survival rate 98 % . &quot;
existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in treatment and in some patients may cause further deterioration of the neurological state .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ox@@ i@@ fies in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , whereby Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is created . &quot;
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its Met@@ abol@@ ites in Plas@@ ma and Ur@@ in were determined by gift of an individual dose of 5 g so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ id@@ ation and liver cir@@ rh@@ osis by up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its Met@@ abol@@ ites were also examined in cancer victims of so@@ dium gene but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
according to a oral single dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form were established 15 minutes after taking measurable Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ cent@@ ations from Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
&quot; in the majority of patients with ure@@ th@@ eses , or hem@@ orrho@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) next morning after the next fasting , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plas@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with so@@ dium poly@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single cor@@ p@@ ants ) , the medium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations in Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel in the third day five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is exhausted within 24 hours to roughly 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gi@@ ated product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine via the kid@@ neys .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us testing , Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at with toxic and non tox@@ ic@@ ogen@@ ic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS gran@@ ul@@ at is given either oral ( inf@@ ants and children , who can still not swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with slots ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ st@@ ine or a nose @-@ sun . &quot;
&quot; according to recent clinical experience , the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day at new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and with grown @-@ growing and adult . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , argin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular , bran@@ ched amino acids ) , Car@@ nit@@ ine and Ser@@ um@@ protoc@@ ols in Plas@@ ma should be held within the normal field . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from an earliest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tr@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or argin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day required . &quot;
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS gran@@ ul@@ at contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per gram of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at which corresponds to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium yl@@ phen@@ yl but@@ yr@@ at resulting in the maximum daily dose .
&quot; when R@@ atten@@ f@@ utes had exposed to Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active Met@@ abo@@ lit by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the brain cows . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) has been reported by a 18 year old anor@@ ectal patient , which developed a met@@ abolic disorder in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ ebox , rhin@@ oc@@ top@@ en@@ ie , periph@@ ery N@@ europ@@ athy and Pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
ru@@ gs seen is Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen ox@@ es ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore considered an alternative carrier to ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus value
&quot; on the basis of investigations on ex@@ cre@@ tory of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ tic cycle , it can be accepted for any gram@@ ms Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen nit@@ rogen . &quot;
&quot; already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in the treatment , and in some patients may cause further deterioration of the neurological state . &quot;
&quot; according to a oral single dose of 5 g so@@ dium poly@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after taking measurable Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ cent@@ ations were determined by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of no more than 25 ° C . &quot;
&quot; with this action , the little bit of measurement will be 0.95 g , the medium measurement spo@@ on 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring po@@ on 8,@@ 6 g so@@ dium poly@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to get the medication over a probe , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS can also be dis@@ solved in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with these rare diseases are missing certain liver enzy@@ mes , so that they can ru@@ mp the sti@@ cking waste products which can f@@ ake in the body after consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;

An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to the treatment of adult patients with &apos; acute blood sugar ( ACS , decreased blood sugar to the heart ) , for instance at inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ er ( heart attack ) without &quot; &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ alen measuring value at the electro@@ cardi@@ og@@ ram or E@@ KG ) . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to the prevention of blood cl@@ auses on patients being applied to patients , a higher dose is administ@@ ered and inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients took part in the major study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox has been compared with a gly@@ cop@@ ic @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ auses ) with the conventional combination treatment with Hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; during PCI the patient has often been an st@@ ent ( a short tube , used in the arter@@ ies to prevent a lock ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent ble@@ eding islands such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift of G@@ PI - in the prevention of new events ( deaths , cardi@@ tis or re@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as a whole as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; patients who were subjected to a PCI was An@@ gi@@ ox in regards to all indicators just as effective as Hep@@ arin , except for heavy blood pressure , where it was much more effective than Hep@@ burn . &quot;
angi@@ ox must not be applied in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other Hir@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it must also not be used in patients who recently had a blood pressure , as well as in people with heavy blood pressure or severe kidney disease or a heart infection . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ s ( CH@@ MP ) led to the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is a decent replacement for Hep@@ burn .
September 2004 condemned the European Commission to the Company The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd provides permission for the transport of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ ms ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ smoking colored ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) during an emergency handle or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is carried out in another episode a PCI mg / kg , an additional bolt should be increased from 0,5 mg / kg and inf@@ usion for the duration of the surgery on 1,75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
after PCI can be taken to clinical requirements again the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a Bol@@ us@@ ement of 0,5 mg / kg shall be administ@@ ered , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of a initi@@ als of 0,75 mg / kg of body weight and a dose of intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and effectiveness of a single blo@@ c gift of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; this value is shorten@@ ed ( ACT after 5 minutes ) , should be shorten@@ ed under 225 seconds , should be a second pin of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the appearance lower ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ tive and th@@ inner drugs should be performed quickly in front of the application and the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis must be given intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1,75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is right administ@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney failure ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are treated to a PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , should be used a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1,@@ 4 mg / kg / h . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , young people and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insul@@ in . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( among the skin ) to the abdom@@ inal wall , the upper sh@@ ank or the upper arm inj@@ ected or as a permanent inf@@ usion with a insul@@ in pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insul@@ in to the control of the Glu@@ cos@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els ( sugar ) in the blood or the insul@@ in cannot be eff@@ ected .
&quot; insul@@ in insul@@ in is different from the insul@@ in insul@@ in , and the change means that it acts faster and a shorter activity than a short @-@ effective human@@ insul@@ in . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a lengthy insul@@ in in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , where the body is not to produce insul@@ in in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; for type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body in insul@@ in is not proven effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the change of concentration of substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study with adults with type @-@ 1 diabetes , after six months a reduction of 0.7 % ( from 7,@@ 60 % to 7,@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.7 % in insul@@ in l@@ is@@ per . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was reduced % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0,30 % at human@@ ely normal insul@@ in . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other components , or in patients who have already suffered at a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra need to be adjusted , when it is administ@@ ered together with a number of other medicines that can impact on the blood@@ shed . &quot;
September 2004 condemned the European Commission to San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH as appro@@ ve of the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is known as sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ecting either in the area of the abdom@@ en ; the upper @-@ thig@@ h or damage caused by continuous inf@@ usion into the area of the abdom@@ inal sho@@ cks .
&quot; due to decreased gl@@ con@@ ogen@@ esis capacities and the decreased insul@@ in insul@@ ator , the insul@@ in need to be de@@ pressed in patients with a restriction of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the active strength , the brand ( Her@@ - unit ) , the insul@@ in insul@@ in ( normal , N@@ PH , galvan@@ ized etc . ) , the type of insul@@ in ( animal insul@@ in ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the insul@@ in demand . &quot;
&quot; 3 A insufficient dosage or the break@@ age of a treatment , especially in patients with a insul@@ ating diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a di@@ ab@@ etic bo@@ eto@@ azi@@ onale ; these states are potentially vital . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of a patient to another insul@@ in type or insul@@ in another manufacturer should be under str@@ ingent physician , and may make a change of dosage necessary . &quot;
the timing of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active service of the insul@@ in insul@@ in and can therefore change changing the treatment file .
&quot; for the substances , which can increase blood sugar levels and increase the incl@@ ination to Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ Con@@ ver@@ ting @-@ enzy@@ mes ( ACE ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , Flu@@ ox@@ i@@ f@@ yll@@ ands , al@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates , and Sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of Symp@@ ath@@ oly@@ tics such as Bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ in and Reser@@ pin the symptoms of in@@ ep@@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ in@@ ism might be scrap@@ ed or missing . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies for re@@ production sto@@ icity showed no difference between in@@ su@@ ic@@ ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ insul@@ in regarding pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insul@@ in breast canc@@ ers occurs in the human breast milk , but generally there occurs in neither into the breast milk , nor will it res@@ or@@ ate after oral use . &quot;
&quot; in the following , those of clinical trials are listed below , group@@ ed by system organs and arranged according to decre@@ asing frequency of their appearance ( very frequently : &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the availability of availability ) . &quot;

heavy Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic with consci@@ ous@@ nesses can be given by an in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ecting from Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) that is given by a trained person or by intraven@@ ous gift of gl@@ uc@@ ose by a doctor .
&quot; after a gl@@ uc@@ tance , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the ur@@ - thing for the heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insul@@ in insul@@ ates the blood sugar levels by the stimulation of the periph@@ eral gl@@ uc@@ ose ( in particular by skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by the in@@ hibition of gl@@ uc@@ ose production in the liver .
&quot; studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be of insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the efficiency occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than in hu@@ - man@@ em Nor@@ mal@@ insul@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 @-@ diabetes , insul@@ in , showed insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in the therapeutic range of 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg a per@@ dis@@ proportionate increase of glu@@ cos@@ es@@ hop@@ tic effect , just like Human@@ insul@@ in . &quot;
insul@@ in insul@@ in has twice as fast efficiency as normal human@@ insul@@ in and achiev@@ es the complete glu@@ cos@@ es@@ cop@@ ing effect approximately 2 hours earlier than Human@@ insul@@ in .
&quot; from the data was obvious that in an application of insul@@ in insul@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ cal control is achieved as with human@@ ized normal insul@@ in insul@@ in , which is 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; was supplied in insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale control was given as with human@@ ized normal insul@@ in , which was 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
