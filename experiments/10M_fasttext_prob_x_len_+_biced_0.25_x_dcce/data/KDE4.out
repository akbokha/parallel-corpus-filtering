&quot; the package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; compliant ; despite their small size , they provide some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of &amp; compliant ; by making this easier available . &quot;
&quot; for more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual for &quot; &quot; Con@@ quer@@ or &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings to setup extensions .... Open the cardboard card tools and choose the modules you want . &quot;
this is a partial list of standard modules from the package k@@ de ; add @-@ ons . please note that maybe more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the package k@@ de@@ base , which includes c@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click at the c@@ quer@@ or ; on extras . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to the crash , if available , delete . &quot;
&quot; the module Pul@@ filter ( also called folder filter ) you can reach in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under extras . with the module you can filter &amp; compliant ; &apos;s up @-@ to @-@ date working directory on different types . &quot;
&quot; to use the DO@@ M Super@@ vision in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extr@@ as DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document , for example : this item , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root section . &quot;
the Module &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; displays a further view for objects with the M@@ IME @-@ Type I@@ node / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbols and text views to see the content of your local fil@@ es@@ ystem .
&quot; the partic@@ ular@@ ity of &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; consists in it , merge stor@@ ey hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map . each object is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or a folder , the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . therefore , large files can be easily detected , even if it can be seen far down in the folder hierarchy . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; it is an entry in the tre@@ ad @-@ presentation a rect@@ angle that represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ es@@ ystem . for simpler navigation , the rect@@ angle of meaningful color and protection preferences . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched via view mode , can be either depth for the slight detection of the prescription , or the illustration of a different file of file as name , owner , group or M@@ IME type . &quot;
a rect@@ angle can specify with the different characteristics of the corresponding file or folder . for each property you may determine if enough space to display is present or whether the surface of sub@@ ordinate rect@@ angle occur ( whereby consequently ar@@ ching faul@@ ts by limitations on the sign of the Tre@@ vor ) . in addition , you can specify the relative position of the lab@@ eling in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; the calculation algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should usually be respected that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . during the tre@@ ad in &amp; F@@ S@@ View , this goal is not always respected . the frame is not always available to present the sub@@ ordinate entries . note that less space will be lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle square is square . &quot;
&quot; like sharing the area of an entry for the sub@@ ordinate entries , the implementation will be left . here it is for the circum@@ vent and the avoidance of space ste@@ eping through the frame always beneficial to the surfaces that are as square as possible . the best methods of this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive form . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimal total surface for an entry on the menu @-@ order view . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordinate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map @-@ Wid@@ gets intended for the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind . &quot;
the module images can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under the Extr@@ as picture gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you call the module &apos;s picture gallery , a dialogue with which you can specify the appearance of the gallery . &quot;
the option title of the site allows you to custom@@ ize the title of the picture gallery page in a text field .
&quot; the option images per line has a sli@@ der and a rotation , to set the number of mini@@ pictures of each line in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the cross @-@ field fil@@ en@@ ame of the picture , you see if the fil@@ en@@ ames will be shown in the gallery in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the cross @-@ field file size of the picture , you see whether the file size is displayed under the mini@@ ature in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the cross @-@ field image size , you will see if the size of the pictures are shown below the min@@ ig@@ s in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog folder , you determine where the gallery will be stored and which sub@@ folders should be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file selection save in HTML file , you give to where the HTML page is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; with the junction box , you can set up with a sli@@ der or a rotation , up to which level the sub@@ folders are included . &quot;
&quot; with the pictures of the original pictures , please copy if the original images to be copied into the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the commentary box format , you can use a commentary file for the cap@@ tion of images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the cross @-@ field pole position , you can also specify a different color pictures in the original pictures . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ settings provide you with easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; -@@ settings for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ;
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extr@@ as HTML settings . the following behavior of the web@@ browser can be specified here :

&quot; a simple camera interface is made available to you so that you connect with your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in &amp; Pres@@ sure , which is supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and each card@@ boards will be supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ tization ; working together . &quot;
&amp; Pres@@ ent ; contains a quick image editing with base processing tools . you can use these to evaluate your photos and to correct and correct . the mach@@ ining abilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
&quot; although &amp; Pres@@ sure came ; easy to use , it establishes a du@@ tz@@ ing professional skills . it works entirely in 16 @-@ bit colour foam and all available modules support the bl@@ anks by means of li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G @-@ Export and ICC pig@@ ment work@@ flow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more met@@ ad@@ ata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or the lens , about which can be chosen . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ tization ; an open source project . this means , it is dependent on the support of the end users . you should therefore report problems and improvements . &quot;
&quot; temp@@ ter came to make the mil@@ king of problems or suggestions of suggestions as easy as possible for them . if you use these links , your web browser will pop up a page in the error system . all required information is used here . just follow the instructions to submit your report . &quot;
&quot; he came here is a project that is supported by a community . that means , the user and developers came to each other . if you have a regular user mailing list of &amp; digi@@ tization ; however , you may soon ask yourself to answer any other users of &amp; digi@@ tization . however , in this mailing list , you should see this language therefore powerful . &quot;
you can also visit the Pres@@ ent ; Homepage to find news about fre@@ ed versions and other information about &amp; Pres@@ ent ;
the best start to get to &amp; Pres@@ ent ; is the registration in the developer mailing list . guide to the registr@@ ations in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ tization .
&quot; if you &apos;re coming ; for the first time , you will be asked where to specify your pictures and your database . you can insert here a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder , to select a folder . &quot;
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data will be saved . this path remains the same for all pictures .
later you can add as many folder as you like . &amp; Pres@@ sure came ; will you use in addition to an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings graphic K@@ am set up
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , the images , as a base folder . no picture will be altered as an album . no picture will be changed . during the run of the folder you get a progress like this : &quot;
&quot; this was temp@@ ted ; dur@@ ates the libr@@ arian path in all its depth . you can no sub@@ folder , unless it was i@@ ste in hiding folder . this allows you to insert a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder of photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums are used in M@@ eine . you can change the album out of the album and put it on the folder symbol . this will then be used as a album symbol . more details can be found in the section albums . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the basic folder , you can set up in &amp; Pres@@ ent ; your digital camera set up . after that , you should learn how to use M@@ one albums and My key@@ word to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw data support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so it &apos;s possible ; possibly also deal with it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , so you find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help Manual support . &quot;
how to set this up and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h de@@ coder settings and Ro@@ h work@@ flow .
&quot; a simple camera interface is made available to you so that you connect with your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in &amp; Pres@@ sure , which is supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and each card@@ boards will be supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ tization ; working together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are registered by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) to data transfer . the connection also appears as a USB mass storage device . the connection can also be implemented via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also be used in relation to the seri@@ als port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; Pres@@ sure came the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , re@@ movable software collection for digital cameras that has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it permits the transfer of images of digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . since photos in general are large files and transmission over the seri@@ als port slowly , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ tization ; supports these cameras and leads the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras will be found here . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ bex@@ if support , so that the umb@@ nails will be made reliably by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 com@@ missions . if the Hurtigru@@ ten support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you will not be able to see anything or the generation might be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things in &amp; Pres@@ ent ; is how easy to extend his functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules : the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a joint modular structure for &amp; Pres@@ ent ; to make the modules available to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules are described in this section .
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is essentially simpler , &amp; Pres@@ ent ; by writing a small module to complement one function than the changes in &amp; Pres@@ ent ; himself perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full @-@ mode mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and desc@@ ending pictures works everywhere : you can drop a picture in another part of the tree , on the horizontal partition line or into another application window . the only limitation is that an image is not in keywords , fil@@ tr@@ list or searches . &quot;
&quot; - a data selection allows you to lift the most common : JP@@ EG , P@@ NG , T@@ IF@@ F , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
the text filter is used only for the fields used in the symbol@@ ise . so the filter@@ ing is displayed on the fil@@ en@@ ames only if this ind follows is displayed . what fields are displayed can be displayed in the dialog of the settings .
&quot; the View &amp; quot ; M@@ eine Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo@@ al@@ ments . all photos that have been stored by &amp; Pres@@ ent ; these albums can be sorted according to the folder , in which they first created on the disk , by which the album was first created . the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly to an album . you can also add a screens@@ hot to an album . select the album Im@@ por@@ ches screens@@ hot . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with your mouse on the target album . you can select the same way or copy multiple photos . simply select all the photos and move it to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features , to give you information about this collection . to click on the album properties , you need to click with the right mouse button on the album and select in the context menu for album properties . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - Coll@@ ections : are a method to highlight your albums , so that you can choose according to a common name , if you choose from collection from the tool@@ bar or want to go albums . if you want to add new collections or want to delete new collections . if you want to add new collections , you can do so in the settings for collections . &quot;
the album Date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View albums sort by date sort .
&quot; the buttons El@@ ders , average , neu@@ tered : this set the date on one of the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . in addition , the average of the pictures from their EX@@ IF information is trying to calculate the date of the last modification of each file in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first came up an album in &amp; Pres@@ ent ; the first picture will be chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; M@@ one Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this is intended to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes , the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to choose another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click on the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As album &quot; &quot; Show &quot; &quot; menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album on the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included in a collection and collections can not be wast@@ ed .
&amp; Pres@@ sure came ; supports the input of key@@ boards for individual photos in the section M@@ a sampling list below in the main window . album Coll@@ ections have another effect . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the picture window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures in this album are displayed in the picture window . each photo will be displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these curtains in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album the first time , you &apos;ll just wait while the umb@@ nails will be generated . this can avoid you in which you can create new pictures in the menu Extr@@ as All papers . &quot;
&quot; information about each picture will be displayed below the corresponding preview . what information this is , you can change over settings ; set up here the albums page and adjust the area view@@ points to your wishes . &quot;
&quot; the umb@@ nails will have aid window , which will release a moment about a photo . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screens@@ hot top of the main window will show such a Help window . &quot;
photos are all to what it came at &amp; digi@@ li@@ king . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures so as it suits you . the image editing shows your photos and allows you to get a number of improvements to this perform . you can reach the picture menu of view or the menu image in the menu bar . you have the choice between the viewing of images , a di@@ asch@@ au or the editing of images . &quot;
you can open the picture editing with a photo by clicking on either F@@ 4 image editing ... or the context menu of the picture with right mouse button and editing ... select a guide you can edit your photos . with the image editing you can view your photos and change them .
&quot; it may occur that &amp; Pres@@ sure that you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button , and how to adjust them to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that the data processing programs can be used by other image processing programs to problems with the data contained in the picture . some programs do not store this data from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , bl@@ ending etc . &quot;
it came with two ways to shoot . the simpl@@ est is to select it with the right mouse button on the preview and select the turning point . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , you can click on the preview and name the ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you keep the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you came a photo from &amp; Pres@@ ent ; delete it in the M@@ ül@@ men of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . f@@ 8 picture Del@@ ete or Ent@@ f If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by clicking on Shift . &quot;
&quot; the View &amp; quot ; M@@ eine Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ des@@ quot ; organiz@@ es your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ tization ; use either the EX@@ IF @-@ Date or if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the dates below in the data collection , so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown . &quot;
&quot; photos with sampling kits provide a flexible and powerful option for your photos to organize and cat@@ alog@@ ize . tags are sti@@ ckers , which can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . as soon as a key@@ word can be assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this sampling or search again . &quot;
&quot; if a key@@ word is selected , all the photos that were marked with this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . you can also organize your keywords log@@ ically . you can also take parts of the tree &amp; quot ; M@@ a sampling , so that you can find the tags you &apos;re looking for , easy to find . &quot;
&quot; the keywords will be stored in a database for quick access and added key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the picture , at least for JP@@ EG , stored . so you can also use your keywords in other programs . in addition , the keywords will be re @-@ imported in the loss of database re @-@ imported as soon as &amp; digi@@ tization ; the images noticed . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by clicking on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word &quot; or to select a key@@ word , after you have a new key@@ word , after you click on an existing key@@ word , this becomes the subject of this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking the key@@ word with the right mouse button and delete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself is not deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a sample by changing it to the desired location in the tree , and then drop a menu that gives you the possibility to move the key@@ word . a key@@ word can only be in a tree at a time . &quot;
you can change the properties of a sample by selecting it with the right mouse button and in the context menu . you can change the name of the key@@ word and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; M@@ a Stich@@ ting quot ; change .
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you need to select the image with the right mouse button and in the context menu as the album panel . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album on the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to handle &amp; digi@@ tization ; s functionality with key@@ word supply , you must first click on two types : once you choose the photos , you can click on the corresponding key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords , you can also select the picture below and select from the context menu key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can select a photo with any number of tags . the photo will be displayed , once you choose one of the keywords to be assigned to a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event , where it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have a photo with key@@ boards , this is displayed under the preview of the picture in the main window . &quot;
you can remove a key@@ word in which you can select the context menu of the photos and select from the keywords menu . the menu shows you only the keywords which were assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view reveals a time @-@ dependent hist@@ o@@ gram@@ mes of the number of images per time unit . a selection can select on this hist@@ og@@ ram . to select a time frame you only need to click on the subject of the selection frame . thus all the related pictures are displayed in the main window .
&quot; in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . it then appears in the list below . &quot;
&quot; include all elements of the database : name , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , dates and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; sin@@ ful search box is a small lamp the green is when the search results . if you click here , the filter@@ ing is deleted and all pictures again displayed . if the search has not found , then the lamp is red . &quot;
&quot; the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this you get a simple search box , as described above . you can read this search here but as a live search , which was always fil@@ tered when you have been stored as a search crit@@ erion . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be carried out . the results are used in a search list in My search list . if you select your choice according to search list , you just need to select the corresponding entry into My search list and select a option in his context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you select search , the form is to enter the search back with the previously specified search information . if you select as an advanced search , the dialog for the advanced search will be able to change your previous search . further information can be found in the section The tool for Advanced search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search out of the list , select in the context menu search . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced Search offers you an enhanced search form with many search parameters , with which you came in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ tization ; s database can be looking for . &quot;
&quot; the list of the search rules will be used to add the options for a search query in the album database . any option can add or remove it . each option can link with others about the logical operations . ... , One ... , one ... or Min@@ b ... link above , you can create addiction of the type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; &quot;
&quot; it came , character@@ izes every image through a long number with a special technique , the hair algorith@@ m . this allows to compare images by compar@@ ing these sig@@ natur@@ es . the smaller the difference between two sig@@ natur@@ es , the more correspond to them . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each picture . by using a weak@@ ening , the results selection can be enlarged or res@@ ized . if you move a picture from somewhere over the symbol of un@@ mistak@@ able search in the left side@@ bar , then they will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sk@@ etch : free hand color sk@@ etch : draw a fast sk@@ etch and &amp; digi@@ tization ; find the matching images . also here a pig value can be set .
this rider is an intui@@ tional map material based on the Mar@@ ble mini@@ button . you can push it with the mouse wheel or push off and move it . move it while you go to the left mouse button . all images within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course this is getting ahead of your pictures Ge@@ o @-@ data .
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . it is then added for a later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; Pres@@ sure came ; introduces a lumin@@ ous in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . he works with all supported image formats , also raw files , together . &quot;
&quot; select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em fi@@ tically add from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lighthouse menu . if you are back in &amp; Pres@@ sure , you can open the lighthouse fast with L Extr@@ as fi@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; from the pres@@ ch@@ amp bar you can compare the pictures that you want to compare , in the left or right area of the window and place there . a small arrow indicates one of the pictures in which window can be seen , then those with the other image are also executed . so you can compare the same area of both pictures . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to choose from a picture series , then the two first pictures are automatically displayed in the fields to display . the right neigh@@ b@@ ted picture is displayed in the right area . this makes it easier to work through a number of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal sol@@ vers are also directly from the lighthouse , such as F@@ 4 file processing .... &quot;
&quot; all images from the right side bar of the main window are available for both pre @-@ papers in the light @-@ table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with loading data . &quot;
&quot; in the lower end of each zone you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can detect on the crossed paths . to hold the visible area of the picture , you need to hold these s@@ itt@@ y and the &amp; L@@ MB ; afterwards , both images will show the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . just use the z@@ oom Reg@@ ul@@ ators among the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse bike to enter into the image and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures if you are Pre@@ view in the mode Pre@@ view .
&quot; what is an digital component management - away from the process ? digital conservation administration looked at every part of the process , after the image has been made up to the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos records , sc@@ ans or digital photos , but most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient manner . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool to secure a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , protect and use photos . we view the procedure for digital photographs the &amp; digi@@ tization . we view the procedure for digital photographs the &amp; digi@@ tization . we consider downloading , figur@@ ing , archi@@ ved , optimize , wait and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; Digit@@ ale component management takes up , indi@@ ces , categor@@ ized , sec@@ ts , addiction , conf@@ ection@@ able and exports content that has a mon@@ ary or cultural value . &quot;
met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data on data . met@@ ad@@ ata are provided according to your definition data that provide information on or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you have more than 1,000 photos on your computer . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you definitely don &apos;t know &amp; digi@@ tization as well as in images and secure archiving you can access to other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you do and you need to know anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to data structure . you need to decide whether other access to your photos , you want to save on a reserved drive or create a network drive &amp; etc . notice that you will eventually change to a larger drive . &quot;
&quot; maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . holiday images can be found quickly via your location . if you do have enough photos , then you will find sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images that you can print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant growth of images to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % Archive and 5 % work@@ files will not be re@@ organized and you will then be able to organise your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of data types makes p@@ ile processing easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and working files is simplified a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you &apos;re looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
&quot; we also recommend the option met@@ ad@@ ata to be saved in the setup page of the met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; Pres@@ ent ; this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file , then you can store the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate point in the menu . &quot;
&quot; now , you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? this puts &amp; Pres@@ ent ; giving them a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real job begins , as you should now select a photo , password and evaluation . of course , you can select all the pictures that may require the same attribute , and then set the value . you start the best with the rating or the leaderboard . this makes sense , as you can concentrate on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s take up key@@ verb@@ s , key@@ verb@@ s , as you are frequently called on other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import kat@@ alogue images from another source with built @-@ in key@@ word , then it will insert the pictures in the right place . the changing the hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by selecting a sub@@ tree on another . the changed keywords are modified by &amp; digi@@ tization ; updated while it pursu@@ es the sub @-@ trees . &quot;
the graphic shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata cuts down . this is a very large representation since every block of met@@ ad@@ ata consists in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are all pictures .
&quot; enough the keywords - the next section refers to co@@ atings , or comments , the third important tool to kat@@ alogue of your met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; you just want anyone to see your photos just , you want them to share with your friends , your family , other photographer and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; take a look at this panorama . from the distance not even a beautiful beach@@ panorama . if you look closer to it , then take a look at some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you this of the Lan@@ de@@ platz of Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing , memories , the historical time period is present again , you may possibly even hear the silence . the cap@@ tion has changed your perception of this panoramic body . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider your photos , the title might be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . remember , the key is to transmit it to the viewer , to help Him through the mot@@ if you prefer to understand what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is ok if an image is not perfect , if it &apos;s the strength only to work with a lab@@ eling for themselves alone . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; Pres@@ ent ; you can export as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , then you can export it to a selection of images at the same time . KDE , you can even share a sp@@ elling check , and / or the title of the Web @-@ g@@ aller@@ es@@ ystems , you will have to tell the story for the open@@ ers no second time . &quot;
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? it was not a boring planet before Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Earth ? well because with pictures the train takes place already with light speed .
&quot; the possibilities for ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization increases are already un@@ countable set . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can also repeat the photos on the reception . you can also export k@@ ml files , but also to Galler@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc . with the goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Maps viewers . &quot;
&quot; copy@@ left is a word@@ play with copyright and describes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the working of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information contained in the interior page of &amp; Pres@@ ent ; as information is supposed to be depos@@ ited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for author and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of a company or organization . after that value , it should no longer be changed . this field does not support Kom@@ mas or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as a partition . &quot;
author Tit@@ le ( syn@@ onym for editor ) : associated with the author . examples may be the title of the photographer . examples of this field may be titles as : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or Independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , it must be filled with . &quot;
editor ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider to identify who the photo offers . this must not necessarily be the author . if the photo has to be listed here for a message agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press . if the photo is a stock photo , then the group / Agency will offer the image here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sessions , although this cannot provide protection against abuse . each of which has a little more than base in working with machines , this can delete or change the solution for this problem . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi@@ conductors this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; Pres@@ ent ; will provide such a module for for@@ kli@@ fts in the near future .
&quot; topics : PL@@ AT@@ TEN@@ FE@@ H@@ LER , thickness plate , ECC , transmission errors , aging of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , lifetime , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that went on the street or fire . these kinds of losses are the same that you can also happen in traditional paper pictures or negative things . in this section about problems with the so @-@ called new media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data re@@ produced company of the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs must be treated these cau@@ tious , and you may not last longer than a couple of years . of course , you can also hold CDs and DVDs in Archi@@ ving quality . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; Dollar ; 2 the piece which is a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe that lies in your measurable room . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can use this risk in which you use good disc@@ s and good audi@@ ences . the best DVD audi@@ ences are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot of reliable . so it is about choosing the right . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to mistakes , even if you have just written only . therefore , they are only effective data , the rest we need for the form@@ atting and control of control . despite this massive protection it is needed for form@@ atting , ultr@@ avi@@ olet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster to the apparently miracle on CDs and DVDs . it is also not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications used by damaged disk@@ ettes , HDDs , Flash@@ media , USB drives etc. etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray disc@@ s appear to win the For@@ mats against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six sm@@ al the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8,5 GB . all what to CDs and DVDs was also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
&quot; re @-@ burn with a good recording on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ ur@@ ve@@ dic format . read afterwards the media with a description , date &amp; author Kenn@@ el and afterwards to a clean , dark dry and above animals protected spot . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media or software that can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; Disk@@ us retain your statistics for themselves . your manufacturing l@@ ants include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the trou@@ bles@@ isms of hard disk drives : disk study &quot;
&quot; in short : disc@@ s keep at the longest if you are operated in temper@@ ament range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temper@@ ament , this error increases the immediate failure . some of S@@ MAR@@ T fixed bugs . this is particularly legi@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and publishing ped@@ ometer . the expected lifetime of life @-@ time is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete list of tension . of course , you can also have data loss due to electricity . before you have saved the files , but these losses can normally be produced without great problems . &quot;
&quot; whilst most electrical devices don &apos;t make much to make use of devices with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause serious harm . on your computer these an@@ om@@ alies can cause serious damage , dry mother@@ boards and other defects . so protect yourself from the in@@ avo@@ ids that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against black@@ heads is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that contains a part of energy heat absor@@ bs and the rest assured . however , it is usually included in the form of a plug @-@ in size . however , remember that not every plug @-@ in bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also watch out the protection against light@@ ning bolt and thus protecting the properly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; since an over@@ load of each cable can use to your computer , you should pay attention to that even all the periph@@ er@@ als may be connected to your system . some manufacturers ask the voltage connection to your mo@@ dem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ ax@@ ial cable and the television card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable transfer protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks , and therefore contain very small and you also contain the protection for the mo@@ dem . therefore , you are ideal for the go . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ load protection your system will protect your system from smaller fluctu@@ ations in the electricity lines , it will not really help you to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a down@@ grade electricity supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protection against over@@ rides , these devices can automatically supply battery power . this gives you the possibility to store your data and run the system . if you purchase a US@@ V , you should be sure that they are satisfied with the same quality requirements like an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the attached software will be interesting . &quot;
&quot; if you have exposed the potential risk that your b@@ illing system is exposed to you , and compare your safety at flow of electricity with the cost of avoiding this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can you keep you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small difference if you consider how well your computer can be protected from . to the end you should always remember all cables before you go to holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service . with the right configuration , you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup goal for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is a further popular offer with which you can save any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; they are home compared to the hard drives , however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . furthermore , you need to send the data on the compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general securing solution . it is too slow . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo @-@ community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not get your pictures in full resolution online . the professional version provides you with more limited storage , which should be checked in reality first . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data security , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically created thanks to the TCP protocol and included in the offer a backup and a distribution memory . so they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ safe . &quot;
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transmis@@ sions are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the fil@@ es@@ ystem @-@ systems and b@@ tr@@ fs make sure the data integrity between operating system and hard drive safely .
the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred to not when this happened in your computer . all these disorders remain un@@ noticed until you have no protection for it . nobody seems to have been thinking about it . nobody seems to have been thinking about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way than that in your computer .
&quot; Un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transmission lu@@ ste , since they create interference within the data streams . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission issues , you should look into the future . already 2010 you will see thousands of errors each year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates to be able to handle record errors , with many patents and is available under one to the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon also available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English . &quot;
&quot; Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ aking fil@@ es@@ ystem . this is still in alpha status , it is still using the same prot@@ ections , and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is still not part of the core . &quot;
under@@ estimate this not ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loaded with the not@@ ebook and 46 % holding the job systems . in Not@@ ebooks is already the percentage of theft 50 % .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; it has been no longer sight@@ ed anymore . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , itiner@@ aries , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to give the spread data systems . a very good English article can be found here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided . if a file has not been completely saved before the problem appeared , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is that while the technology is further developed , there is a natural fron@@ tier for this progress . sensitivity and drugs character@@ izing for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border . &quot;
today &apos;s cameras go towards 10 Meg@@ api@@ xel cameras and the end result is more deterior@@ ating for compact cameras and high quality optics are the Optim@@ um for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras require your border with 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard disk get you today for 100 &amp; euro . so do not make anyone other for data transfer . thus secure your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you do anything like the re@@ install of your operating system , the exchange of records or the size of your hard disk . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , an Blitz @-@ suggests you will be lucky when the drive in the moment was not connected . &quot;
&quot; a disaster proposes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget flying menu : fire , water , electricity , children and theft . they usually concern an entire room or complete house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , disaster prevention is always a not local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a more common reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic . if you have a backup , which is not immediately available , then you can save the one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that are to be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : a backup of the files changed since the last full backup data . creates a complete snap@@ shot of two time points : the complete assurance and the last difference .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup has been made . this backup comes from a version@@ ing system on the next with the exception that it is only det@@ ained and not on continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily configure your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer@@ ral sc@@ rum that were actually changed . this is com@@ pressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
secure important images directly after you saved it on your computer to DVD or another op@@ tic medium .
&quot; this approach makes you enough time to explore losses and restore it . at the same time , you come to secure a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot of at least a month and a snap@@ shot of any month . each other out@@ fit should be done manually , after which you made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; themes : met@@ ad@@ ata in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , Associ@@ ated X@@ MP files , original retain memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ ent images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; to make valuable pictures next 40 years , that &apos;s about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be respected : &quot;
&quot; since the future because of your nature is un@@ predic@@ table , you must look at everything today and evaluate them during the time . unfortunately , there is no other possibility to be used as a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . all 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system back@@ wards compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the more easy it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by declar@@ ations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and back@@ casting technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay in open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually increasing .
&quot; let &apos;s proceed from that you have inserted the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition . with * nix systems , such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record : &quot;
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new record has been recognized by the system , but do not hang it . &quot;
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db # source is / dev / s@@ dc / s@@ dc / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ # / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; dollars ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of re@@ iron if necessary
&quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software is available , you can create this self . this task will become easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG was developed as an open source Standard designed by GI@@ F . but it can be much more . it is des@@ ust@@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Metad@@ ata , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F and this format , we would like to recommend you to store your images . &quot;
T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as a picture format . T@@ IF@@ F can save in un@@ com@@ pressed form or in a container with a lost com@@ pres@@ sion@@ s@@ m ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . however , there is a problem that this format has been adjusted to many people . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
DN@@ G The digital neg@@ atives file format is a licence @-@ free and open @-@ picture format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G was developed at the T@@ IF@@ F / EP format and committed to the use of met@@ ad@@ ata . a handful of camera teams is now available and we hope to use the Mit@@ ber Canon and Nikon .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced his XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology . it is a characteristic technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored the XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive a original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , to archi@@ ved . X@@ MP is required , however , there is the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the image file . therefore , you should think about whether you use DN@@ G as a container and put it all there together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata standards , which support a wide range of applications and modelling , annual conferences and workshops , standard conferences and workshops , standard connections and enlight@@ ening efforts to achieve a broad acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the dealer or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera ship , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fin@@ ite processing , you can use external programs . if you came back the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ tization ; then edit the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these have been cut under certain conditions from the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the edited pictures for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only then in Web@@ gal@@ eri@@ as , coding in MPEG , use in contact leaf@@ lets , print and etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; Pres@@ ent ; in the section add a photo to an album you will find a description , as you can already add on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your album database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; Pres@@ sure , connect them to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , this is trying to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a he@@ ater indicator can be displayed on the lower end and the umb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be displayed . some cameras will not appear . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ame and a symbol for the file format is displayed for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you might need the camera information to each entry . with the page features and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog shows file properties and the photo information that is stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded to your computer . note that with some digital cameras , not all information is available . &quot;
&quot; the tab met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata as tr@@ un@@ cle , manufacturer , GPS and the image . this information is the same as in the met@@ ad@@ ata @-@ side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; Pres@@ ent ; or the image editing . please note that these met@@ ad@@ ata are not available for a few digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; Pres@@ sure . when downloading the photos and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired default method of &amp; k@@ de ; select the button you can download and then download the photos . the button selected can be selected as long as you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera does not support this , an option is new available . these pictures have not yet been downloaded by &amp; Pres@@ sure . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the pre @-@ showcase . if you choose this option , the new pictures are downloaded , of course , only the new pictures are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you want to download or download the buttons , select a dialog with which you can select the target album . the list of existing albums will be displayed as normal folder , displayed in the section M@@ ein albums . then select the target album out of the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after which you have selected the target album , you press OK , and &amp; Pres@@ ent ; loads the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them . if you just want to delete the button , you must delete them first and delete them deleted . &quot;
&quot; note that there is no possibility to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera , they will be completely eliminated before you delete them from the camera . if you want to delete them from the camera , you should do this about the camera menu , since this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras are used as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos frequently not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are normally deleted once again , in case you load photos of different audi@@ tions in the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ames . &quot;
in the next section you will find options for rotating and sp@@ y of the image and for dat@@ ory @-@ based sau@@ cer . if you use this latter option automatically is created a folder per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three additional options that will be carried out before the photos on the plate are stored . the first two concern the data about the author in section Standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty . if you select this , the corresponding entries are correct for the load information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all download images . &quot;
if you want a different file format than the default format you can use for example in the editing field the pre@@ fix photo@@ - % Y@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . turn the option date &amp; time to read the help of the command to read .
&quot; if you use the camera file name , you have the possibility to change fil@@ en@@ ames in lower case letters . or in case letter , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; Pres@@ ent ; for a photo is shown below the name , will display the camera in the preview . your settings to ren@@ aming are stored and automatically used when you open the camera next time . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization : can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to perform an automatic rotation during down@@ lad@@ der . not all cameras are available for download . in the section side bar met@@ ad@@ ata you can read more details , about the information which your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic la@@ ung is usually turned into , and if your camera does not deliver this information ; the photo is in the original orientation . if you want to switch the automatic rotation , use the button to install and select the Autom@@ atic la@@ ung in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera has information about the date where the photo has been made available , &amp; digi@@ tization is based on the image data . all images with the same date will be downloaded in the same sub@@ album . not all cameras are available in the same sub@@ album . not all cameras are available in the same sub@@ album . not all cameras are available in the same sub@@ album . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ a @-@ data you can read , which information your camera could have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case stores &amp; digi@@ tization ; the photos directly on the target album . if you want to change this option . use the button to select the button @-@ based sig@@ al@@ ment at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the button download . then select the file select dialog box . appears , where you can select the files you can upload . you can also choose more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the selection is , asks &amp; digi@@ tization , where the images will be loaded high . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start the up@@ loading . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this is a position that is indicated in long@@ itu@@ dinal and l@@ atitude , and that can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian T@@ ON@@ AS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical place . not everyone uses a plane to carto@@ graphy a territory through automatic recording of GPS data to car@@ to@@ graphic . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was done , you can open with a click one browser which shows the area . user may send a postcard to another &amp; Pres@@ ent ; user who wish to loc@@ alize the location of the photo , it &apos;s good to let the positioning data of a photos . &quot;
&quot; the question is how do the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as the direction , Satt@@ el@@ ites and maps are actually supported by using the correct hardware , about a post@@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to geographic access ( manual ) and finally over the manual entry of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receiver . either as card@@ module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you have to save this data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format which is supported by the module to the geographical assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS which can extract data from images and from GPS . on the following page you can use the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itu@@ dinal and l@@ ati@@ tudes or other data , then you can use this script using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the badge coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ googl@@ e.com will show no European street species . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; it came to give you as much control over his work flows as possible . there are many settings that change the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ tization ; change in the Settings Settings . you can choose between these settings ; you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left . &quot;
&quot; select action can display accommodation in built @-@ in view or image editing . they set the standard behaviour of &amp; digi@@ tization , if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the Stand@@ ardi@@ zation and copy@@ right@@ ed data . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields . it is also written with database synchron@@ isation . this data is written to the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author title is a syn@@ onym for the author : this field should be the profession of photographer , freel@@ ance photographer , freel@@ ance photographer , independent photographer , or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a further description of the author , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; editor is a syn@@ onym for provider : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author , as this is the image other &amp; quot ; provider ; if the image is a stock photo , then the group or agency should be en@@ umer@@ ated here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this met@@ ad@@ ata has been constantly contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; Pres@@ ent ; this met@@ ad@@ ata are also available for other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ tization .
&quot; pictures as built @-@ in ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JP@@ EG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you add to your photos , with the pictures taken into pictures . attention : with pictures that are already lab@@ eled by other images , these are already written by &amp; Pres@@ ent ; over@@ written . &quot;
&quot; the page settings contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse c@@ ursor in the main window via a file rests . depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; Pres@@ ent ; supports a number of different educational formats , and some video formats and audio formats . to set what file types &amp; digi@@ tization came ; show , you can add the file extension of this list and remove . each file in a &amp; digi@@ li@@ ner which has not received this extensions , by &amp; Pres@@ ent ; ignored . &quot;
&quot; the default settings can be reset , by pressing the kno@@ b to the right of each category . &quot;
&quot; however , the settings of the illumin@@ ative of &amp; Pres@@ ent ; can be placed on this page on the default values . however , some pictures have switched different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size inv@@ itations . if you have one , then you can only get better results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image editing a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can switch it here . you can switch the tool@@ bar in full @-@ mode mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or lighter color in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image editing this picture mode can be switched with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 , and switched off . &quot;
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia about the closer explanation .
&quot; with the setting of P@@ NG com@@ pression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality , since P@@ NG requires a lost algorith@@ m . the only effect is that the image data is more time to discharge and un@@ zip . thereby , 1 : a low and 9 a high com@@ pression . &quot;
&quot; with the T@@ IF@@ F files com@@ press the De@@ fl@@ ate button for T@@ IF@@ F images , this reduces the size of T@@ IF@@ F images . it reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . it has no influence on the images , since the De@@ fl@@ ate @-@ algorith@@ m is lost . &quot;
&quot; with the setting of loss of JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files , you can store loss @-@ free . even if you have written the shifting settings , the relation between quality loss and file size has been written far better than with normal JP@@ EG . as this paragraph were not yet supported , the met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported , but found in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ tization : image editing only one image panel for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for mani@@ pulation of your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of the image editing . &quot;
&quot; the default of default is that all green pixels are identical . if you use this option with a minimum loss of detail . this option marks the image a little soft , eliminated but the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern is eliminated with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white comparison of the camera is used . otherwise , if set the Autom@@ atic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the white comparison is not placed . standard is it a fixed color balance , based on a white map that was photographed in the sunlight . &quot;
this option is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has got the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps more details in the pick@@ ups . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
&quot; the standard is the top @-@ light , so the parts of your images are imag@@ ines into the settings . the setting colors will trigger some unusual results , as it shows the sh@@ re@@ por@@ ter in various ros@@ es . most recently , you can attempt some parts of missing information from the pick@@ ups . &quot;
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fs therefore try the missing green and red parts from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pi@@ xel to re@@ construct . of course this is a question how much color or white you want .
&quot; when you select the option re@@ construct , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three compromise and can therefore be customized for each image individually . &quot;
&quot; Set the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ee to your taste . you probably have to put it somewhat higher than the default one . but this can also be done later in the picture options of the &amp; Pres@@ ent ; in order to keep the time for the demo@@ mm@@ age small , you should be conservative . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing - algorith@@ m is a digital imaging process to gain a complete picture from the colored images that have many cameras and which makes a matrix coloured pi@@ xel . this algorith@@ m is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction .
&quot; digi@@ tization : and D@@ cra@@ w are available to you three alternatives : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . according to some tests it was created as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorith@@ m of the edges . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you &apos;re looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the colour@@ ing vari@@ ance of your lenses , you can put the red and blue @-@ correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as it is done during the pipe . &quot;
a profile translated into colour information and gives instructions how this should be given . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; Pres@@ sure ; information such as the colour information can be translated from a colour room to the other so that colors are as accurate as possible .
behaviour questions when a picture is opened in image editing / colour management module with raw files .
&quot; color : you can save the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC
settings of ICC profiles you have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be depos@@ ited . everything can be changed at the opening of the raw file later .
the color administration view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your images colored not the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should use the camera manufacturers and model that you use . not all profiles are created on the same type . there are some , such as Canon who do not have any color mapping or Gam@@ mak@@ or@@ re@@ oplast@@ y . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma is not for con@@ versions at 16 bits of depth . this means you need to do the color mapping . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the soft @-@ proof profile , with which you can em@@ ulate as your printer can get a smaller color area than your camera and some colours can therefore be very satisfied , rather than to rely on the blin@@ king algorith@@ m of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is pretty obvious which color profile for them is provided . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ officially : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile expanded the style for the target : F for an accurate style , L for Neutr@@ al , N for portrait , P for portrait and S . &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; sculp@@ tors and images are supported ; many modules were written to collaborate with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; if your distribution has installed K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules that you want to use , and then these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
&quot; for tasks , which are run by modules can be set in the menu under settings of short @-@ command commands . &quot;
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I module .
&quot; the settings of the di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper regul@@ ator j@@ us@@ hes the time between the images , usually are 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other An@@ cross@@ ings turn the met@@ ad@@ ata and which are built at the bottom of the pictures during display . &quot;
&quot; camera functions show on the left a list of all the cameras supported on the left . on the right side there is a button Autom@@ atic recognition , which is trying to connect the camera . currently , there are serv@@ omot@@ or , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire Mass memory . &quot;
&quot; in the lower end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) software storage camera . you have to specify here the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / re@@ produces , specify where you attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; Pres@@ ent ; you need to connect the camera with your computer , put them into the display mode . &quot;
&quot; check out whether &amp; Pres@@ sure came ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set cam@@ amo@@ del and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera appears in the menu camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert it here . &quot;
&quot; with the option of confirmation dialog for moving from &gt; Pictures in the M@@ ül@@ men , you can set the conversation of &amp; Pres@@ ent ; in the delet@@ ing of a photo . in the clear@@ ing of a album and delete a album you will find more details . &quot;
editorial changes through the right side bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; digi@@ tization ; if you use the option changes in the right side bar without any queries . otherwise you need to apply changes to the kno@@ b changes .
&quot; you can also include the display of the welcome terminals of &amp; Pres@@ ent ; in the starting point , this acceler@@ ates the start of &amp; digi@@ tization ; &quot;
the setting @-@ m Start for new pictures forcing us to look for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start @-@ time of &amp; digi@@ tised : . if something came out of the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ tization ; you whether it should delete them from the database . &quot;
various colour schem@@ as can be used in &amp; Pres@@ ent ; to adapt the main window to your taste . these settings can select you under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; Pres@@ ent ; you can find more information about this tutorial .
it comes with a quick image editing with some basic tools . you can use this to view your photos and to correction and improvement . the image editing may be started by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of preview and selection of the entry display / editing .
image editing contains a number of tools to enhance your pictures . some of which are available as modules in &amp; Pres@@ sure . so you are under certain circumstances not part of your distribution . further information about the K@@ IP@@ I module can be found in section image editing .
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current data number , magnific@@ ation factor and the current image size . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar at the top edge , and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions . &quot;
&quot; the editing functions of the image editing will change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you save file Save or the button save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
so you should not get a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with file save .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can re @-@ establish the original image by re @-@ establish from the menu File re @-@ establish the image editing in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have been performing in the photo since the last stor@@ ing . &quot;
virtually any action of the image editing can be revers@@ ed or recovered . the last action you can un@@ doing by selecting working straight and restored by selecting mach@@ ining from the menu .
&quot; if you frequently use this , you should make yourself the keyboard abbrevi@@ ation , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to restore and make C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift key to re @-@ establish . &quot;
&quot; if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; about the back@@ stop or re @-@ establish button in the tool@@ bar a moment longer press , you get a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions are also revers@@ ed or recovered . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the menu item you are asked if you want to save them . &quot;
&quot; you can get in the photo and out zo@@ oming , in which you do C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the menu @-@ menu . &quot;
&quot; to adapt a photo to the window size , you can use this kno@@ b in the tool@@ bar : enlargement factor automatically &quot;
view complete mode displays the photo in full mode . you come to normal view in which you use the vin@@ c button . normally you can see this in the setup dialog by &amp; Pres@@ sure . you can view this in the setup dialog by &amp; Pres@@ sure . you can see this section on the setup of the image editing .
&quot; if you want to print the current picture , you can print the image file print and receive the default &amp; cable ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single images or whole phrases . whole bunch of images can be printed out of your selection . you just need to select the pictures with the default methods and export from the menu Album to create printer assistant . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to meet your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Pres@@ ent came ; main window has a side bar at the right edge , which is available to provide important information and actions for the selected images . the same side bar is available , even in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders are cli@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; multi@@ player clicking on the same rider can appear the side@@ bar , or disappear again in the edges . &quot;
&quot; in the App@@ ell@@ ation view , you can enter cap@@ ri@@ ments with un@@ limited size or insert . note that all the special characters are permitted . these signs are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can use other programs . &quot;
the IP@@ TC data only support ASC@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and are printed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC coating field in other applications you should consider these restrictions .
&quot; after which you commented on it , you can use either the button or simply switch to the next picture , the co@@ atings are then saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the applying button , there is a button with a button . with this , you can read further met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or database . however , you can also check the met@@ ad@@ ata in the files . however , this will always be done when you have a met@@ ad@@ ata setting , which will always be written in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the section rating shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and variety . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard abbrevi@@ ation Str@@ g + 0 ... 5 . the rating from the side@@ bar is always applied to a picture , select this and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . the coding follow the sch@@ ema in the following table below :
&quot; the sampling view shows a search box to the fil@@ e@@ word of the keywords , the key@@ word and a selection box with the previously in this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ments ; -@@ session gr@@ ass@@ ed key@@ word . &quot;
the sampling tree is adjusted dynam@@ ically to the given search password . you can thus restrict the number of options in search of a key@@ word quickly . this ability is particularly useful if you have many key@@ word .
&quot; the input field at the lower end is a further relief when entering into a picture series . if you have selected various key@@ word , they will be saved for quick access . &quot;
key@@ word can also be set by mark@@ ings of the corresponding anch@@ or@@ fields in the tree . all the keywords of an image are stored into the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
&quot; select several pictures in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this is only applied to the highlighted image and not on the whole selection , if you want to provide a selection with a key@@ word , please refer to the key@@ boards point . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar sampling is used to change the selection of windows displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar with their album , - fil@@ um@@ - , key@@ word and search@@ engines are used . if in addition one or more key@@ boards from the right is displayed , only the cutting quantity of these two will be displayed . all desired key@@ word are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also draw conclusions and drop . suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side bar . then , a dialog , which you ask if you want to ask the key@@ word . &quot;
in the upper example the main window shows the pictures at a calendar day . the sampling filter is reduced to a key@@ word . the key@@ word has been selected with Str@@ g + a and afterwards a key@@ word has to be drawn from the right key@@ word to the selection and dis@@ car@@ ded on whether this key@@ word should be put into account .
&quot; this search for changes will take place at any start of the program , and you can also be switched to settings in Miscellaneous . &quot;
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and determine that it would be one or one , you can easily change it with a double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry , after which is chosen in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
you can use for example a Ex@@ tended search of all elements of the database with the following options :
&quot; if you want to group@@ ed options , you only need the cross @-@ field at the end of the rule and then follow the button group@@ ing . the options can be seen as follows : &quot;

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it &amp; Pres@@ ent ; s concrete implementation adapted .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed work@@ flow is that the colors come from your camera or scanner , you can reach that the colors on your monitor can print from your camera or scanner , and that the colours you print or on the web publish them from your digital dar@@ k@@ room . &quot;
&quot; when the theme comes to color management , everyone wants to know what buttons it needs to provide . unfortunately it means adequate background information about color management . the meaning of this tutorial , you will give you links with deeper information and enable you to make your own informed decisions . &quot;
&quot; if your desktop work@@ flow meets all the criteria listed below , then you don &apos;t have to worry about color administration . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is available on the s@@ R@@ GB color scale . ( more information can be found below )
your only other images are by e @-@ mail or the Web where s@@ R@@ GB of de facto standard is .
&quot; so if s@@ R@@ GB functions so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should one use another color room and have to worry about color wounded ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors that we can truly see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colours we can see the hu@@ hor@@ se@@ atic region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger farms , so visit Bruce Lin@@ d@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and then click on information and then on Information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to k@@ alli@@ ze my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ R@@ GB colour ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in the s@@ R@@ GB color room or not , you need to work your monitor k@@ alli@@ zes , since s@@ R@@ GB does not include the circle . if you are working as in Far@@ br@@ aum of s@@ R@@ GB , you need to either use your monitor to the s@@ R@@ GB standard , an appropriate monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve an image in most cases . therefore , use it before you try a further manual process . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize the functions norm@@ alize , waste management and contrast from the menu corrected Autom@@ atic correction is automatically trying out of your colors to make the best . you will be experimenting with these effects to see which best in your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method sk@@ ali@@ ert the lumin@@ ous surface of the whole picture , so that the dark point is black and the bright@@ est point as bright as possible without its color sh@@ ad@@ ation . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations : this method reflects the illumin@@ ates of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ og@@ ram of the intensity can be the same number of pi@@ xel . sometimes , the same very good results achieved in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracle in a picture or it destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic compart@@ ments : this method maxim@@ izes the color area in the red , green and blu@@ epr@@ int . it identi@@ fies the dark and light border @-@ tones and j@@ us@@ hes the red , green and blue @-@ channel channels on the whole hist@@ ograms . &quot;
contrast : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image through the shifting of the lowest and highest values on the wid@@ est and highest values in between . this is only visible in full images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white comparison of &amp; digi@@ blo@@ wn ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to carry out the white comparison of a photo .
&quot; the white @-@ hand correction is somewhat limited to a color tree with 8 @-@ bit per colour . so if you can perform too far from the original image , in case you can perform the white mode right in the raw mode , which in 16 @-@ bit mode , you will get your possibilities for correction better . &quot;
&quot; this tool is based on a white balance sheet , which is protected by P@@ aw@@ el T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . you start it via the menu @-@ entry colour white comparison of image editing . &quot;
&quot; the pre @-@ showcase can be adjusted to the size . on the left hand , both the original image and preview of the target picture . the preview is dynam@@ ically adjusted the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white comparison , then it is enough to click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the destination has a red mark@@ er . the pi@@ xel of the pix@@ els below this mark@@ er will be shown as vertical line in the hist@@ og@@ ram .
&quot; right up there is a hist@@ og@@ ram indicated that dynam@@ ically changed once you have a parameter . this hist@@ o@@ gram@@ mes is very helpful , even in well illuminated images , most pixels very small l@@ umin@@ ous values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadows , s@@ ati@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shadow of the shadow lets you improve your photos or even down . &quot;
&quot; An@@ stat with the above controls can be used , you should use the color temperature Pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the picture to use the color temperature of the white balance sheet . in this way , the temperature and green -@@ values are also automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white comparison with the list of preferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ load indic@@ ator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pix@@ els are over@@ exposed .. you will be shown the combined result in the whit@@ eboard . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; the buttons , and store exactly this . each setting of the white balance which you have set , you can save it into a text file and later load it again . &quot;
the button preferences set all the filter values again on their standard values and the associated @-@ neutral white balance . notice that even neutral settings will result in a different photo as your original . if you save it will be your original picture .
&quot; you can set here the codi@@ fication per colour channel of the be@@ edited image . 8 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality pictures . this coding requires better for high @-@ quality pictures . this coding requires even more turn@@ table , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and DN@@ G formats . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw materials . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color @-@ mapping can be carried out by the sub@@ window for the use of color profiles . a det@@ a@@ illed manual for the use of color profiles can be drawn at install@@ ments .
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu under color sound correction , and allows you to store your settings at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always need the same mistake and you will always need the same correction . in the manual for audio correc@@ tions you will find further information . &quot;
a very powerful option to fix issues is the tool for gr@@ ass@@ ation that you will find under the colors Gr@@ ad@@ ation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; Pres@@ ent ; tool Far@@ be@@ ff@@ ers represents you four farms , a solar effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a cant@@ een . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , solar power was also called Sab@@ ati@@ ans , the effect of the picture was created by a partial light@@ ning bolt from the additional light . this had the effect that the lighter areas dar@@ ker and the colors caused by the second ill@@ um@@ ination . the result was a part of the image . this tool allows you to test this interesting effect fine . &quot;
the intensity controls the solar power . at approx . 50 % intensity shows the image which is chem@@ ically possible . another increase will finally generate a negative image that does not generate such a phot@@ op@@ ier .
this is an example of solar @-@ term . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and it is processed ( 2 ) . the intensity is more than 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vid Fil@@ ters simul@@ ates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ Eff@@ ect . he is distinguished from a satur@@ ation that he makes a stronger contrast , which makes the colors brilliant and gl@@ az@@ ing . try it simply , it em@@ bell@@ ished many photos . &quot;
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for one in daily light @-@ driven colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly satisfied colours are however also some photo@@ grap@@ hen , especially those who are barely landscapes . &quot;
&quot; the ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light to the contr@@ asts . the parameters level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repe@@ ating the strength of the ne@@ on@@ lich@@ ts . at large images , the filter can load the entire CPU for one moment . &quot;
digital cameras have frequent problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to correct the color contr@@ asts and the lumin@@ osity of your photos with the tools in the menu under color . all your lig@@ ations can be seen in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you are applied .
if you are making a photo with bad light conditions you can get the reverse problem : one to great satur@@ ation . even in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation will reduce it . all changes that you can perform in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; between the complex tools Gr@@ ad@@ ation and the simple lumin@@ aire / gam@@ ma , the tool is sound @-@ correction to improve the exposure . even if dialogue on this tool is very complicated , you need only the range of sli@@ der . concrete the three sli@@ der below the hist@@ ograms . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graphs of the intensity , an hist@@ og@@ ram , the active channel or of the selected area . under the graphs are three sli@@ der into the inside and that can be moved to change the intensity of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation it is the regul@@ ator to move and to watch out how the picture changes .
&quot; the original and preview of the picture can be seen . the preview is dynamic , updated with the settings of the picture . on the left , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set to indicate whether the hist@@ og@@ ram with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis is represented . for pictures the large areas of a constant color include the linear hist@@ o@@ gram@@ mes of a single column . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic organization is useful .
&quot; three Reg@@ ul@@ ators : the top for the dark sounds , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , frequently called gam@@ ma values . &quot;
&quot; the three color @-@ pin@@ ets can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically generate the input values of the shadow , middle and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic alignment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators that can be used to change the output values as well as with the input values , for example , use a well @-@ light image as background to create while being seen something else in the background . &quot;
automatically : with this kno@@ b the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity of the image .
&quot; save as and shop : with these buttons , the data recorded in the fil@@ es@@ ystem can be saved and later loaded and later the Gimp is used . &quot;
&quot; when you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pp@@ ets , the input levels will automatically be new for all shadows , funds and solar notes . activate the original pictures that you want to use and click the preview of the original image for Rot@@ - , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ ia channels . &quot;
the option over@@ load indic@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ loaded pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator that is to display the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
&quot; below you can see an example of the judicial values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left , half of the original is displayed as well as the target image . the preview is updated dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available : &quot;
modification : this selection box allows the channel to indicate which the module is changed :
&quot; in addition to this box you are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures with a digital camera , the linear mode creates a wide beams . in this case the logical mode helps the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode . &quot;
&quot; if you move to the right for example a spa @-@ line , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones with a dar@@ ker output lets and that the corresponding pic@@ xel dar@@ ker will be dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; preview the original pictures is a red mark@@ er . if you want to change this mark@@ ings on the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve , which is the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value to your taste is j@@ us@@ hed . &quot;
&quot; save as and shop : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . each bend that you have created can thus be saved in the fil@@ es@@ ystem and will be loaded later . the file format is the Gimp Short format . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use this method and the three color table buttons , you automatically create the check@@ points of the curve to all channels of the shadow , middle and solar notes . activate the colour pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original picture for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ cur@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ load indic@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if available in more than one channel over@@ loaded pixels , you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ white photo that has been corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ous channel . Sch@@ atten@@ - and sun @-@ t@@ ints was applied with the colour pi@@ p@@ ette and set to the cur@@ ves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixing of &amp; Pres@@ ent ; sculp@@ ting is a tool to improve the colour channels or to change the shades of photos .
the channel bl@@ ender is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mix@@ er the image editing .
&quot; with the channel default box , you can select the colour for the hist@@ og@@ ram . this gives you a first reference like you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared to your own tab . &quot;
&quot; preview the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ og@@ ram to show you the appropriate colour value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are right below : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction will enable you to blend these channels , since the channel mix@@ er will keep track to creating great black @-@ white con@@ versions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix Monoch@@ rome , the reduction of one color leads to a visible noise which occurs by the color channel , which is not at the same place in the color channel , and whose diamond pattern is different in each channel differently . if that &apos;s the case you can improve your Monoch@@ rome conversion in which you will reduce the color first . &quot;
the save as and loading buttons are used just for this purpose . any mix@@ er setting can save you for later and then load . the file format is the Gimp channel mix@@ er format .
the option over@@ load indic@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ loaded pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator that is to display the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was new j@@ us@@ . the option L@@ umin@@ ia preserve . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the be@@ edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / White photography was always fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography is black / white a work@@ step that color pictures can be converted on the computer . also with a set of film rolling profiles .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super
&quot; Grün@@ filter : simul@@ ated a black / white movie coating with a green liner filter . this looks good , with all scenarios and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Green filter . &quot;
Oran@@ ef@@ il@@ ter : simul@@ ated a black / white movie coating with a orange filter filter . this improved landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
rot@@ filter : simul@@ ated a black / white movie coating with a red lin@@ ter filter . this creates dramatic pain @-@ effects and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ul@@ ts@@ z@@ ags for day@@ time . thus similarly as the 00@@ 3 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white movie coating with a yellow lin@@ sen@@ filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to 001 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Gel@@ b@@ filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm bright and middle notes while he adds a bit of cold in the shadow and re@@ development in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similarly to the 005 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; Pres@@ ent ; tool texture apply you to apply decorative textures to an image .
&quot; adding an texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points , or like a m@@ ural on a wall . the menu @-@ order image texture can be used for it . &quot;
Rel@@ ief : move this parameter to the right increases the sem@@ bl@@ ance of the depth and three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the picture .
a paper Tex@@ ture@@ ff@@ ect has been applied in the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter Rel@@ ief is set to 200 .
with the &amp; Pres@@ ent ; tool frame can add a decorative frame around one image added .
keeping an eye on the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the stre@@ aming eye . below the frame can add the module from the image editing .
&quot; type : with this parameter you set the desired text type for your image . all the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surround it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white pictures ) , dra@@ ined with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame . ideal for one button @-@ dimensional and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range of value for the width is restricted from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image will be larger than the original but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of images , especially if you have used the tool After page ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can insert an easy @-@ format text into an image to any position . this also goes to multiple places when you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with its characteristics as you need . the larger the image , the larger must be the character set . to conclude , simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ out background . already , the image is finished . &quot;
&quot; each setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK &quot; . after the picture is saved , the text part of the picture . he can no longer be changed . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; Pres@@ ent ; tool sten@@ cil , you can put a template into an image . &quot;
the menu image sten@@ cil are used in image processing can be used to put an image above an image .
&quot; for the sten@@ cil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format and should be adding with maximum com@@ pression mode ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the sten@@ cil , so send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; Pres@@ ent ; mail@@ ing@@ list Pres@@ ent @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to put your sten@@ cil with the kno@@ b base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you put the sten@@ cil files . these settings are made for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root canal was set for the sten@@ cils for the sten@@ cils appears a construction , which reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil . the selection of a folder is updated automatically . &quot;
under review there are three buttons with which you can change the magnific@@ ation factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button is enlarged the shown picture . it is centered to the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; smaller : this button bl@@ ur@@ ns the underlying image . if you want to apply the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template into the whole picture , you need to cut the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this kno@@ b to post@@ p@@ one the picture below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired location .
use OK when you want to apply the template into your image . the image will then be adapted to the automatic set size .
&amp; Pres@@ ent ; introduces three different tools to watch . each one of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharp@@ ens is a traditional tool for heating . it is very fast and easy , but produces especially in dark areas , gr@@ assy pictures . &quot;
&quot; in@@ shar@@ k mask is working on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharp@@ ly . indeed , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it a really good job . the algorith@@ m was taken from Gimp and it is copy@@ right@@ ed by Win@@ ston Chang . &quot;
&quot; we possibly focus on the best of the three , as he really improved the har@@ p . he is a bit more complicated in his application and has different parameters to adjust . &quot;
photos without focus and most of digit@@ alized images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . these elements are smaller than the resolution must be summar@@ ised if color points are printed on paper . SLR cameras require usually more detri@@ mental sc@@ and@@ ing as normal cameras for private users .
&quot; at JP@@ EG pictures , often a camera has been applied internal sharp@@ ness@@ ing . pictures in the raw format must always be weak@@ ened in while processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner contact the filter filter during the reading of the image . if you dis@@ able this de@@ activate , you will get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get usable results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the archipelago . you can call the menu entry to the menu item . &quot;
&quot; but you should hereby deal with caution because the results are not very natural ; the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also increases the noise . in general , you can also achieve more information about the menu item re@@ focusing on you . under re@@ focus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharp@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the picture a little soft , it is much easier than it sharp@@ ens . use the tool for soft@@ war@@ ter with the menu navigation column on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove vei@@ ls from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help the image process . the pre@@ showcase is showing the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values are often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount will reinforce the effect . if you create the in@@ shar@@ per mask , smoking and the impression of gr@@ aten in the proximity of sharp edges . &quot;
the radius poses one how many pixels are hit on each side of a channel through the filter . high resolution images allow larger images . they therefore should show pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the bl@@ amed image one that is added to the original . this makes the strength of the har@@ p .
&quot; the swelling will be a break from the maximum of R@@ GB value and the difference difference . you can thus define a minimum difference between the tones of sharp@@ ness and therefore beauty errors in faces , need@@ les and water surfaces . &quot;
this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the edited image the ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king was used with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool focused on stimul@@ ates a picture by improving the har@@ p . it used the copy@@ right@@ ed and algorith@@ m of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to create a picture &amp; quot ; re@@ focused on this . this is better approach than just trying to bl@@ ur the photo . it makes use of a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters . you can usually see better results than bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king . you can start it out of the menu by watching colors re@@ focusing on image editing .
&quot; in practice the circular flow is working much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , which also depends far from the source pi@@ xel , which is far influenced by the original pi@@ xel . the F@@ IR Wiener in@@ verse is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pi@@ xel . the causes unwanted results . &quot;
circular loop : this is the main parameter for the use of this module . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . you can set a higher value if your image is very bl@@ ur@@ red then but in Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt .
cor@@ relation : an increase in the cor@@ relation can help art@@ e@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be chosen by 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.95 and value . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; Rau@@ sch@@ filter : an increase in the smoking filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 only rarely helpful . if the smo@@ k@@ filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a usable value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value will continue the image further . &quot;
Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ S Sch@@ är@@ fe : this is the radius of the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche Sch@@ är@@ fe . use this parameter if your in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed filter is caused . in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid in@@ compar@@ ative art@@ e@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal zero so you might also have to increase the cor@@ relation and / o@@ der@@ filter filter .
&quot; mattress size : this value determines the size of the transformation method . an increase in the size of the transformation size can produce good results , especially if you choose great values for the circular shaft or the pal@@ ate &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; the save as and loading buttons are used just for this purpose . any any refl@@ ective parameters that you have set will be saved for later , and can then be loaded . &quot;
&quot; try all the cuts , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before you use the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later left uncomfortable art@@ e@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; if you are reading images and com@@ press , &amp; eg ; as JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to the un@@ com@@ pressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , bl@@ ur@@ red masks better results than sharp@@ ens . this could be caused by the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood as sharp@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; theoretically , bl@@ ur@@ red do not have to create arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the in@@ shar@@ per filter . practically , the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the in@@ shar@@ per mask . the F@@ IR Wiener Filter is often better at editing small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp color picture has to be corrected . this picture was done with a analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the Auto @-@ focus Lin@@ se .
&quot; for more information about the methods of sc@@ atter@@ ing , you can read a technical comparison of English using this address . &quot;
the controller smooth@@ ens the in@@ sist@@ ence of the parti@@ tions of the ab@@ omin@@ ator to create a natural p@@ ile .
&quot; the colour tin@@ ent allows a adapted colour for the p@@ ile . if you want a blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here . &quot;
the tool image correction is one of the most widely developed tools in order to not remove the desired art@@ e@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the Equality algorith@@ m was developed by the IM@@ AG@@ E Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g Project .
&quot; this tool contains various benefits as starting points , to simplify the restoration . the available preference settings are listed below : &quot;
&quot; if you want to choose the filter settings for a j@@ us@@ tion , you can also use the rider smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail@@ ing p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this is the preservation of details . a small value leads to a consistent smooth@@ est over the image . on the basis of higher values depends mainly by homogen@@ eous regions and details . please note that the details will always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated and should be sub@@ ordin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; dependen@@ cy Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es even@@ ly in all directions while having a value close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gr@@ itt or create a high value cor@@ rug@@ ated patterns . JP@@ EG art@@ e@@ facts are best eliminated with a value close to 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth@@ ing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all . then set the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore put this value to the degree of smoking in your picture . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is prescribed , as it is difficult to generate geometry of the picture . even if you want to produce a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ lets , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
re@@ ps : indicates how often the algorith@@ m is running . usually it is possible 1 or 2 .
&quot; angle @-@ span da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : wind dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha is small , it should also be small . so you should select this value as a size and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
integr@@ ale ped@@ als &#91; 0.1 , 10 &#93; : integr@@ als step in pi@@ xel . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pi@@ xel smooth@@ ing and never bigger than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality that you receive from the option of this option is only small . but it doubles its duration . we therefore recommend it out .
&quot; the buttons , and loading make exactly this . every setting of image errors can be correct in a text file and later loaded again . &quot;
image faul@@ ts correct is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load for itself . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button crash .
below you can see how faul@@ ts with small art@@ e@@ facts have been corrected immediately . the module is created on a photo that was created in Guatemala city with an an@@ alogue camera . the original picture is among ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ li@@ ction came ; Rau@@ sch@@ reduction is a very powerful tool to smoke images . it uses a copy@@ right@@ ed algorith@@ m by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool displays chosen imaging filter for instance , for st@@ ains and other art@@ e@@ facts that come from dust or hair on the lens ; it can also be used to remove sensor @-@ painting from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ dol ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about digital cameras of digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screens@@ hot is shown a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gr@@ ated noise which can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub @-@ window details and the sub @-@ advanced settings can remain with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is needed for filters . large values increase the time of filter per pi@@ xel and can exp@@ ire the picture . the area indicated throughout the picture and the color in it will be adjusted and thus made minor errors . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness of the pi@@ xel . this value sets the pi@@ xel fail@@ ures to determine light @-@ resistance . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details do not receive more and smo@@ ker or lubric@@ ate again . &quot;
edges : controlled the cant@@ een for the har@@ p . this value enh@@ ances the frequency response . if it &apos;s too strong can not be removed the entire noise or smo@@ k@@ ets can occur . put it on a value close to the maxim@@ ize if you want to remove a f@@ aint smoking or JP@@ EG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend you to change either color or light @-@ density to improve an image . these settings will not affect the smooth@@ ing process of which is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color toler@@ ance of the image . we recommend you to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings will not affect the smooth@@ ing process of which is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; Gamma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ ing of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dark areas , which typically ben@@ ds more strongly contrac@@ ted , however , he lubric@@ ates the shadow . &quot;
&quot; shock absorption : controls the alignment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ ing absorption . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter@@ ing is responding to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if he is lifted to high , the edges and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter may occur at the edges . he can remove so@@ cks and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; save and store : these buttons are used precisely for this . all parameters for smokers , which you have set , can be saved into the fil@@ es@@ ystem and later loaded . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of how harsh reduction of your life can change . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) , and the correc@@ t@@ ated with ( 2 ) . the smoking reduction was applied with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft , is fortunately much easier than an image to sharp@@ ens . use tool for soft@@ war@@ e. the showcase on the right side of dialogue shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease photography .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . he is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s smoke , film @-@ gr@@ ated images that are made in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images to remove the content like it is also the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the same algorith@@ m can be used for dy@@ es and textures , the algorith@@ m for restoration was developed by the IM@@ AG@@ E Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ kre@@ I and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g Project . &quot;
&quot; JP@@ EG arti@@ facts reduce : the com@@ pression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss of com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ism , he creates some com@@ pression &amp; quot ; arti@@ facts that can be seen in un@@ com@@ pressed image . this attitude is intended to correct this problem . &quot;
&quot; the buttons are saved as well as loading , just this . every setting of photo restoration can hereby be saved into a text file and later loaded . &quot;
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take a long time and a high CPU burden to move . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
below you can reduce as a photo with par@@ er@@ mig@@ es smoking . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the ber@@ ized film @-@ based on the faces . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the clo@@ cked below ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time textures was applied to an old colour photo that was used with a scanner . the original picture is seen below ( 1 ) and the picture below is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ xel picture ; tool hot@@ pi@@ xel allows photos with a C@@ CD camera gem to remove . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pix@@ i project that are copy@@ right@@ ed by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are particularly high in high quality raw mode photos a problem , since many cameras with JP@@ EG com@@ pression over an built @-@ in repression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; in a photo with a dark @-@ picture sub@@ method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels . &quot;
download this file into the wiz@@ ard with the Kno@@ pf k@@ screen . the tool is highlighted by automatic and light pi@@ xel . these are highlighted in the picture .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can pick up the dark picture directly in connection to detect new hot or bright pixels through C@@ CD Def@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should upload the matching picture of the dark picture to correc@@ ting the bad pixels . note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark picture and this automatically invites you to the next meeting . &quot;
the image area and the preview help you to correct the outcome . the pre@@ showcase is showing the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are superior in all the pres@@ ets .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ish this pix@@ el@@ blocks . these are the available filters :
thir@@ st : there will be an average of the neighboring pi@@ xel . it will be assigned to all def@@ ective pi@@ xel in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pi@@ xel you have a distance of 1 from Pix@@ el@@ block ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ish the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default filter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pix@@ el@@ block will be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that will then be used to inter@@ pol@@ ish the pixels in the block .
Kub@@ o : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be up to calculate a bi @-@ Cub@@ an surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that then will be used to inter@@ pol@@ ish the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pi@@ xel correction on a shade photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original picture was increased to 300 % , and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; Pres@@ digi@@ ti@@ fication Cor@@ rection is a tool to correct the Vign@@ et@@ ation , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , one image . &quot;
&quot; fores@@ angle objective , particularly those in the middle and large photo format , can often reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light to the sensor there . teleph@@ lenses show under circumstances also this behavior . &quot;
&quot; but he also has dis@@ advantages . a lot of center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the Bl@@ ending filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . fores@@ angle objective should also use with center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise in@@ shar@@ per effects are created by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the big cover areas of today &apos;s film or gray @-@ speed range from digital cameras and movie scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Center@@ filters , applied without this filter . the tool is protected with an Center@@ filter on a picture . the algorith@@ m is copy@@ right@@ ed by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three controllers , you can control the Vign@@ et@@ ti@@ fication correc@@ tive filters and with three other exposure to the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controlled the level of light absorption at the point of the greatest density the fil@@ mm@@ . the default density is 2,@@ 0 , which has a op@@ tic filter with a bl@@ ending adjustment of 1 , or random@@ ly , raise the density to compens@@ ate for a bigger degree of vi@@ ability to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ osity , contrast and Gamma -@@ settings : the mach@@ ining of an image with the Vign@@ et@@ ti@@ fication correc@@ tions reduces the lumin@@ ance of the target image . they need to re@@ generate positive values , as you only need to raise the settings . &quot;
if you want a hos@@ tile rev@@ amping of the exposure of the target image so let the values for light / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the Gr@@ ad@@ ation from the &amp; Pres@@ ent ; sculp@@ ting from the menu color Gr@@ ad@@ ation .
this is an example of the Vign@@ et@@ ti@@ fication correction to a picture . the original picture shows the c@@ ture in the corners and ( 2 ) the correc@@ tive picture . a lumin@@ ous and contr@@ ast@@ correction was also performed in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ tization is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ right@@ ed algorith@@ m of David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion . colored distor@@ tion cannot be corrected using this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second gr@@ ades covered the general geomet@@ rical aber@@ ration of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or kon@@ v@@ exe form of the picture .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third Gr@@ ades has a similar round effect , but at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient fourth Gr@@ ades corrected the remote corners opposite the second Gr@@ ades . if you combine these two can be eliminated any geomet@@ rical distor@@ tion .
general : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the second gr@@ ades . with negative values they can be corrected and positive values of kis@@ sing distor@@ tion .
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion fourth gr@@ ades . this value acts stronger at the edges , in the middle of the picture . for most of the lenses , the &apos; corners parameter set the sign of the parameter . &quot;
z@@ oom : this value sk@@ ali@@ fies the image size and thus performs a correction of the first dig@@ ades through . negative values enlarge during positive the picture .
&quot; bright : this value gives the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , illustr@@ ates the dialogue with a preview the distor@@ tion correc@@ tions . the values that you use for your image will be stored and used in the next start as standard values . &quot;
&quot; the tonn@@ age or cus@@ pi@@ red correction should be carried out before all the cuts or size changes . most of the best , perform this correction as all the first . in case you have a picture to cut and after that a tonn@@ age would be the effect of the fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction to you , this tool displays a vertical and horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the se@@ ein@@ gs or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the tonn@@ ages with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cold @-@ shaped distor@@ tion , the resulting image black corners will have . you can transform them with the fe@@ eder tool in the menu , cut off the image editing or via the z@@ oom Reg@@ ul@@ ators of this dialogue . &quot;
&quot; for most of the pictures the T@@ onn@@ al correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some motives like photographs of front , frame and paintings , it &apos;s the perspective so to correct all the angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that when you keep the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the production @-@ shaped correction to a church in Norway . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorith@@ m is based on a method of simul@@ ating infr@@ ared @-@ film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u@@ .org web page which is accessible using this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ Infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity area of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
&quot; beneath the preview , you can set two parameters to set film @-@ gr@@ itt and film @-@ sensitivity ( ISO ) . the ISO regul@@ ator changes the amount of film gr@@ itt and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows will know how snow ! &quot;
&quot; because the filter colour channels to reproduce by infr@@ ared movie , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply to black / white photos , as the colour information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infr@@ ared film from New Zealand . the original picture is placed under ( 1 ) and the original picture below ( 2 ) . the original picture of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a type of au@@ ra in the top .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter film gr@@ itt is a simple to reproduce tool to re@@ generate films gr@@ ading to your pictures . this is known by classic high @-@ speed fil@@ men such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the ten@@ derness of the movies and mix the manufacturers great silver specimen of the photo@@ em@@ ul@@ sion .
&quot; the film cat@@ ching effect gives your photo a certain atmosphere or seems to move back into the past . if you want this special , Galerie @-@ like , rhin@@ estones , gran@@ ular sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos so you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; by regul@@ ator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated for monitoring the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the Kör@@ ner calibr@@ ated . the default value is , although often higher values need to be adjusted to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more bodies , you can use the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of film cat@@ ching @-@ based on a black / white image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined ( 2 ) . the user @-@ sensitive hyper@@ sensitivity equivalent to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter Oil gem@@ äl@@ de generates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ right@@ ed algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and breast@@ feeding are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two regul@@ ator to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the p@@ inch size between one and five out . th@@ icker brushes are better suitable for great pictures . smooth@@ es controls the smooth@@ es or , from the other side , the hing@@ es . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ete is marked with the ( 2 ) . twe@@ et size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and smooth@@ te 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter coal drawing using colour and intensity gra@@ dient , to create a carbon@@ ic in drawing . pictures whose gra@@ dient is slowly change , therefore , if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch to you . this would be good pictures to start recording . &quot;
there are two shelves with a value of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regul@@ ator select the se@@ ft@@ size and the lower j@@ us@@ hes the contrast .
this is an example of the coher@@ ent filters . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adjustment of the Int@@ ensity Office .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ li@@ ction came ; filter engra@@ ving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ ained in wax , it uses a copy@@ right@@ ed algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ li@@ er ; filter engra@@ ving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . he works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure , where colour does not use the differences between colour and intensity , to transform the picture into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ing landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to set the contrast to the filters . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default . &quot;
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the depth is 10 % .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distor@@ ted sec@@ ts . it is used by copy@@ right@@ ed algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
wave @-@ blocks 1 : shares the image in cells and makes it look as if it is seen through gl@@ ass@@ ing blocks .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : an@@ alogue to the wave @-@ blocks 1 is distor@@ ted the picture here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can ab@@ ort these effects any time with the kno@@ b .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an art work using in@@ sharp@@ ness effects . it is used by copy@@ right@@ ed algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
z@@ oom in@@ shar@@ per : bl@@ amed the image along stern@@ ant lines that are of a central point . this simul@@ ates the in@@ shar@@ per of a zo@@ om@@ able camera and thus generates a dynamic expression of the often in sport photography .
radi@@ al in@@ shar@@ per : get the image through rotation of the pi@@ xel to a centre . this simul@@ ates the in@@ shar@@ per of a revol@@ ving camera .
removal in@@ sharp@@ ness : exp@@ ose the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
&quot; movement @-@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ amed the image through Horiz@@ ontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the in@@ sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : out of a car or train photographed , camera . &quot;
in@@ sig@@ nat@@ ing o@@ bl@@ ings : caught the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright killing . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and sh@@ iny soft focus ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or to add a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
sho@@ oters : caught the image through random shift in pixels and simul@@ ates the in@@ sharp@@ ness of an arbitr@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent o@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the color @-@ bas@@ ins in the picture and caught these without change the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : shares the picture in rectangular cells and then created it , through the col@@ t with an average pi@@ xel . &quot;
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
the shelves are a nice small tool to make shelves to your image . this gives it natural your images a n@@ asses look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ right@@ ed algorith@@ m .
dri@@ lls size allows to change the size of the drop . since the dro@@ pl@@ et size does not automatically increase the size of small images . number changes the number and density of drop . Fisch@@ au@@ gen changes the visual effect of drop in the picture .
&quot; you can hold with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image editing an area free of shelves . use the range , e.g. a face that should stay free . if you start afterwards the filter free of rain drops , the area will remain free of rain drops . &quot;
this is an example of rain drops . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the be@@ worked image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it by mir@@ rors or turning the turning into the right orientation . you will find the tools to transform or transform your mir@@ rors . &quot;
photo shooting is definitely one of the most advanced tools in order to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; a picture to gri@@ pping is simple . the big question is , how can you find a picture up and the details are sharp ? how can you find the missing information once more or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g @-@ algorith@@ m is used here , makes it a good work . try him and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can change it on the desired size with the tool size size sc@@ aling . choose to change size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is below to see . &quot;
&quot; the tool to change the size is using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method , to push the pi@@ xel . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to shoot . &quot;
many educational programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge one image . &amp; digi@@ tization has been developed by the IM@@ AG@@ E team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g Project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New Size and are listed below :
&quot; aspect ratio is maintained : if it is enabled , when entering the new size the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is prescribed , as it is difficult to create the geometry of the picture . even if you want to produce a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ lets , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the buttons , and loading are used just about it . any inser@@ tion for photo , can be saved as a text file and later loaded up again . &quot;
&quot; photo shooting is very fast in what it makes , but it can last very long and a high CPU load to move . you can drop the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b . &quot;
&quot; you can see a sample below for a photo , by adding a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the view ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard lifting . &quot;
&quot; cut a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to cut a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pull the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you left the mouse button again , the territory of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of your photo to cut down . you can change the size of the subject area by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle stop by it simply with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cross @-@ section , use the Kno@@ pf The Zu@@ id button of the tool@@ bar in the tool@@ bar and the photo will be tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or Save Target As in the menu file to store the newly released photo . &quot;
&quot; in terms of view , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by shift the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue will remain intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After side ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format , the larger value of height and in the cross @-@ format of width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool After side @-@ aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you are centimeters , inc@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see e.g. a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to sc@@ rolling the selection automatically horiz@@ ont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
&quot; down in dialog , you can use the Max . ratio kno@@ b the area to access to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen relation and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool followed by side ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation ( horiz@@ ont@@ ally or ver@@ tically ) . if you are using the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation tables , so the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the EX@@ IF data and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the work@@ book assistance enable help to bl@@ ending aid , so that you can better put your images better . these aid are : &quot;
harmon@@ ious triangle : harmon@@ ic ponds are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third @-@ reg@@ im@@ ple , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles . &quot;
Golden centre : the golden centre is a division that is on various natural growth patterns like the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us pussy or the blast@@ o@@ ars of a sun@@ flower . it emerg@@ es in all sorts of things we feel as beautiful .
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has been used among ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to make your temples and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your images , buildings and even photos together to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i eps . 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , etc . a composition that is the rule follows as visual harmon@@ i@@ ously . &quot;
the golden centre will provide liquid relief lines if you put an image below . these aid are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ als will bring you to your aim to achieve good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ third spiral , the golden spiral path creates a liquid spiral along the line of the spiral along the line of the spiral , and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the rect@@ angle of the golden spiral , also called Golden La@@ ecke . it should be something that the eye takes place in the centre of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this can simply be there without the eye , it will fulfil its purpose . &quot;
&quot; the Golden tri@@ angles also lead themselves from the above g@@ ild@@ ed golden spiral . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equ@@ in@@ calcul@@ able tri@@ angles . di@@ agon@@ als are not syn@@ onymous with these lines can be placed an st@@ atics object dynam@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; when you use golden tri@@ angles to break up your frame , create an effect of professional photo graph@@ ers dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your images on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t reach any other way . &quot;
the options horiz@@ ont@@ ally reflect and util@@ isation can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic divisions .
&quot; with the button color , you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the aid lines can be invisible . in this way you can custom@@ ize the color of the lines of your current image . &quot;
the Free rotation is a tool to turn a picture around any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , then it happens slightly that you &apos;re not just vertical or horizontal . this creates an image where things came around a corner . you can fix this with &amp; Pres@@ ent ; image editing and the tool free rotation . you can transform this free rotation and j@@ us@@ tion the target angle . &quot;
rot@@ ate your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this ship are given in degrees . with the button preferences you can bet the sli@@ der again to 0 degree . a preview of the window is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right top .
&quot; to help your help , the module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse button in the picture to position the two lines . now you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now j@@ us@@ tion you describe the angle as in previous section . &quot;
after you shoot a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix it is the function transform@@ able to use the image editing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the function automatic re@@ cut . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option marks the picture a bit of turning . but take note of the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tive transform@@ ations are carried out at a fix@@ point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red quad@@ rate to the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ calculated . on the right of the dialogue you will find some information which will help you change the perspective :
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas which have emerged through the transformation . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas which have emerged through the transformation . &quot;
angle to the top : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle right : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after the adaptation of the perspective the image becomes a little lubric@@ ated . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you custom@@ ize the perspective , you get un@@ joyful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to regret it is the picture with transform@@ ations to cut off the image editing . &quot;
the sn@@ ail tool is used to move a part of the image into a direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal section for example will move the upper part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left . this is no rotation that turns into a parall@@ el@@ og@@ ram . you can transform this module over trans@@ forming sc@@ iss@@ ors .
sc@@ iss@@ ors see your image by opening the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can push horiz@@ ont@@ ally and ver@@ tically . if you push to pres@@ ets the angle is displayed on zero . a preview of the effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right side of the umb@@ nails .
&quot; to your help , a vertical and horizontal line appears . move the mouse to a significant point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sn@@ ap tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after which you have carried out the sc@@ aling , the picture will be a bit wis@@ ely . for a single shift , this effect is usually neglected twice as much dis@@ ks and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the shot , the image has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate this is the image with transform@@ ations to cut off the image editing . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization : requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write pictures . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were comp@@ uted . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of formats with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all available files on its system . however , you will always find JP@@ EG and T@@ IF@@ F . &quot;
&quot; this list shows only files in formats . this occurs with the file extension , and a comparison of those with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is shown in the image editing . you can change this list of file extensions &amp; digi@@ tization . in the section configuration you will find further information about this . &quot;
almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras allow you to choose to use the format . a more detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ tization ; supports both formats .
&quot; expression com@@ pression is the use of data com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ers to digital pictures . thereby , redund@@ ant information is reduced to store the image data on an efficient way . &quot;
&quot; JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , gl@@ atter@@ y results as JP@@ EG in the same com@@ pres@@ sive relationship . the 200@@ 0s can also be saved if this is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the photo format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous landscape and Cambridge in colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw image images in JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F with the raw image . in the section configuration you will find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ tization ; supports the loading of raw materials only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ tization . all supported cameras , you can see below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of raw formats , supported by &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in Avi@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . &amp; Pres@@ ps came ; but is not a movie processing program and therefore has no cinem@@ atic possibilities to display or edit . if you click on a movie file &amp; Pres@@ ent ; settings for playing movies to play the program to play .

&quot; if you trade the steps 4 and 5 that you can do well if the initi@@ als contrast was very good , then you can carry out the first four alignment with the module white comparison . &quot;
many tools you need to have the photo processing are in &amp; Pres@@ ent ; contain your description here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as fl@@ int@@ ing , soft@@ war@@ fs , smo@@ other , cra@@ ving , bl@@ ur@@ red , bl@@ ender mas@@ king , &amp; etc . use a uniform dialogue type that shows the effect on the current picture below . below you see &amp; quot ; texture user @-@ quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) The progress of the filter on the current picture shows the status of the filter on the current picture . left of it allow five buttons to change the compar@@ isons of the pre @-@ area . these modes are :
ver@@ tically share without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the chosen division .
horizontal divide without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the lower displays the filter applied to the area below the selected pres@@ ch@@ ment area .
ver@@ tically sharing . the left section shows the original and the right to comparison the effect of the filter .
horizontal . the upper section shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the demonstration area , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can switch to over over@@ - and sub@@ str@@ ations . the colors used can be adjusted in the general introduction .
( 3 ) : the frame for the selection of the Pre@@ view . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and shown on the part of the picture by which you &apos;ll see di@@ e@@ Pre@@ view . preview the left part of the dialogue is immediately updated .
&quot; ( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and opportunity to reset any buttons on your default values , all settings vary from the last use of the module . &quot;
the side@@ bar properties shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory : it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters in the shooting of the photos . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider is an intui@@ tional map material based on the Mar@@ ble mini@@ button . you can push it with the mouse wheel or push off and move it . move it while you go to the left mouse button . all images within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course this is getting ahead of your pictures Ge@@ o @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to manipul@@ ate color pal@@ ettes and to choose from colors .
&quot; the pall@@ ets files , which are by &amp; k@@ de ; can either be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot user @-@ defined color and appro@@ achable colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog range , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or search files . &quot;
the c@@ ursor is displayed in the pall@@ et view as a line . it can be moved by clicking the area beside a color .
it shows the color next . the color is described below the pall@@ et view . here also the color name can be changed .
&quot; it can also be used to choose from . to create such a choice , click the area beside a color to move the c@@ ursor to it . then move the mouse with penet@@ rating left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the cross @-@ box Bei@@ m is inserted into the button color , the color is inserted from the color table on the c@@ ursor . the color is inserted either one or over@@ writes one another ; depending on whether mode over@@ write mode is selected , by selecting the crossing @-@ box under Bei@@ m c@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection , which was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions of copying , cutting and paste . &quot;
&quot; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit : used the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each colour three values for the parts of red , green and blue and an optional color name , if another color is followed . if there are three numer@@ ical values in the cli@@ p@@ board , this can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; &quot;
the colors in the range and the output selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
you can choose a color somewhere on the screen and then choose the color selection on the left side .
&amp; graph@@ ically viewer ; is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; s graphics are free layout programs . graphs are used in science and in particular in computer science . so far there have been no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs showing graphics &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; K @-@ viewer project has set itself the goal of replacing these programmes through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; cold ; program .
&amp; graph@@ ically viewer ; is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ ite ; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; cold ; program features in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graphs in &amp; Kate ; the graphs expects and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; Kate ; to open or the graphs in &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; in a &amp; Kate ; -@@ component to open
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems with about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to present more than these knots )
&quot; further required software : &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which preced@@ ent the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of the graphs are required in the individual : &quot;
&quot; the main window shows the opened graph , each in a separate window . in this case , the tool@@ bar is open as the bottom screen . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the symbol file open and the ( blank ) list may open . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the bottom of the screens@@ hot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the Grap@@ h is bigger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this summary , or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with penet@@ rated &amp; Alt ; -@@ button ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by the factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the file has been modified in &amp; k@@ graphical viewer , loaded file from another program , the following window will appear : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the Grap@@ h should be re@@ loaded and whether you want to ignore the change , so that it will take a decision later , you can set up your decision later , you can set the menu item settings k@@ graph@@ ed ; see also . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a graph@@ ite outside a running &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; gl@@ os@@ viewer ; instance , or want to present the graphs in a sub@@ window of the already ongoing instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can permanently store your choice but also change it with the dialog dialog . &quot;
&quot; in the program start , you can open all the graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice as well as later . &quot;
you can also define how the Grap@@ h should be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
&quot; if you use multiple sites , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which are to be placed on a page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled with the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
&quot; view page with one on several pages , with no head@@ line and with another font . &quot;
&quot; the page again store is the possibility to set the behaviour when a file has been altered on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can specify a standard behavior ( automatically re @-@ load or ignore the changes ) or the program of each time . &quot;
&quot; the site opens the possibility to set the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphical viewer , when a Grap@@ h is opened outside of a current session . you can set up a standard behavior for this case ( the graphs in a new window or set up in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time is qu@@ eri@@ ed . &quot;
the site seat management provides the possibility to set up the start @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ graphical viewer . you can set up a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine if you are asked at any time .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; offers more possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose among various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Lay@@ out@@ algorithms . the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&quot; dot ; -@@ algorith@@ m , the standard for prop@@ elled graphs . the algorith@@ m lays the edges contained in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as possible as few cant@@ een cuts . &quot;
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorith@@ m is the standard for un@@ just graphics . it produces depic@@ tions under the spr@@ ing@@ line model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai @-@ algorith@@ m is used with statisti@@ cally multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; -@@ algorith@@ m created for un@@ coated graphs - layout . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold he@@ ater which contains a multi @-@ moon for the treatment of large and g@@ ec@@ l@@ ust@@ s graphics .
&quot; the &amp; cir@@ co ; -@@ algorith@@ m sends the knots of circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kau@@ ff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of several cy@@ c@@ lical structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command . the command should accept graph@@ ite data as parameters , and the calculated layout of the graphs to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can give special options , or change the graphs with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of graphs ( directed or un@@ coated ) and uses the standard algorithms for the respective type to ( dot ; for oriented , &amp; ne@@ ato ) for un@@ just graphs ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is activated , the overview is displayed , if this is necessary . otherwise , it is not displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
shows the What is the Mou@@ se@@ po@@ inter . click with this mouse @-@ c@@ ursor to one &amp; GUI ; element to get more help to this item ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available under this address and in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og file .

&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows GPS co @-@ ordin@@ ates to add and edit GPS co @-@ ordin@@ ates in the met@@ ad@@ ata of a picture , and the geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ sampling of the picture and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alisation makes tools available for images geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordin@@ ator system , which is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo , to locate . height , long@@ itu@@ dinal and l@@ ati@@ tudes are used . &quot;
&quot; to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data , you need a GPS track as an XML file in the g@@ p@@ x @-@ For@@ mat@@ . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device . &quot;
image Geo@@ graphical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the pictures that you want to cor@@ relate to the main window and call the menu . the above to see vision@@ ary dialog appears . of course , you have to load a sp@@ ur@@ file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains the same time at the same locations as the pictures of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the file has loaded an automatic cor@@ relation , which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ dates are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera is expected with the GMT . this can be performed by time zone . put it in your camera zone . &quot;
&quot; the vari@@ ance for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives a high devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera eit . lies the vari@@ ance among them , the data is assembled . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have a trace data from one place , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the difference of time of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the pictures in this area . &quot;
&quot; the options Inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in min. can be used if you don &apos;t have any appropriate data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ difference between camera and GPS is , you can put this borders here and then press the button cor@@ relate to the inter@@ pol@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you use a number of photos at the same place . as the dialog should use the coordinates of a call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the loc@@ ation can also be found and found in accordance with the suggested map and enlarge . choose this time again , until you reach an immediate accuracy . the card can always be manually selected . the map may change between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang out the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script using the exi@@ f@@ tool to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums into a picture gallery of HTML pages con@@ form to version 4.01 . you can select the albums as HTML pages , and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set will be UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization . &quot;
the module has four riders in which the settings may be adjusted . the rider selection allows you to select all albums . the albums are not hierarch@@ ically displayed . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly choose a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ es and the text of the text of the HTML page will appear . &quot;
&quot; the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option for each picture will also create a page . if you then click on a picture , the picture will be displayed directly with your default photo , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed &quot;
&quot; the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your associated images . select a folder that contains the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF data is also stored in the new pictures . &quot;
with other color depth you can change the standard colour depth . this also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
&quot; the rider show will allow you some of the settings from the album rider for the pictures , that are small images displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user on how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
&quot; if the module created the pages the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore start the program@@ m@@ isions to determine if bugs have occurred during generation . the web browser will start automatically at the end , to view the preview of the gallery . push the module to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image panel is a very fast and flexible OpenGL based tool to look at pictures .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I visu@@ als allows you to watch a selection of images and run on them basic oper@@ ations as screen@@ ings , zo@@ oming or rel@@ oc@@ ating . it has been designed for fast imaging and quick access to its functions . &quot;
after the start a picture is displayed by default in full @-@ mode mode . this can be changed into a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JP@@ EG @-@ free module is a tool to change images without inter@@ fere with your quality .
&quot; this module allows to store for the actions below , pictures in JP@@ EG format , without paying the usual losses to quality or met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage , it is increasing the file size , as there is no com@@ pressing for color information . this can be used e.g. with the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera cli@@ ent is a tool to allow you to connect to your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ e.@@ org. You : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Metad@@ ata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import -@@ function of the met@@ ad@@ ata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the picture you want to copy in the main program and then call the file op@@ tionally to copy the file format . the data will be copied after you click on the button OK . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write in any target format . JP@@ EG is supported by writing . please see exi@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a di@@ asch@@ au .
&quot; the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG @-@ video , with a defined length , to convert . this module also includes the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . between the individual images you can add a base screen manually . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV over the Di@@ ash@@ au . &quot;
all pictures are automatically matched to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition you can select a back@@ color for the di@@ asch@@ au . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
&quot; you first need to choose the images which are to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . afterwards , you can start the module by Extr@@ as MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . &quot;
the images selected by you are then listed below image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sor@@ ting of the images or the contents of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should custom@@ ize the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is set and probably the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step you should indicate the time in seconds the one picture is displayed , including the speed of the image transfer is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast to a very smooth vertical change . &quot;
the back@@ color can be set next . in doubt you should have them black . the name and the path of the generated file can be set to the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep the extension as possible .
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of audio file , then this will be integrated into the movie . depending on the speed of your machine , you can go to the creation of the movie . depending on the speed of your machine , you can now go to a coffee or enjoy a coffee and enjoy the di@@ asch@@ au if you are back again . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages to the right below . &quot;
the printer assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper along with standard images . the combined images can also automatically print with image processing Gimp . this is e.@@ g : sensible to print you or print the Gimp module into direct expression .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import your images stored in RA@@ W format in one of three formats JP@@ EG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command lines d@@ cra@@ p from Dave Coff@@ in . an original piece of Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ p , not that it creates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! &quot;
&quot; first , select the RA@@ W file which is to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image file window appears then in the mode for a single picture . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now optimize the values new to optimize the con@@ versions of the conversion process . the key parameters such as gam@@ ma , brightness and Red / Blue amplifier . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later on . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ coloured R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected , so that you can use the double information . if your camera works in the R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats , and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JP@@ EG uses a lost algorith@@ m and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the tag@@ ged Image format , T@@ IF@@ F , ret@@ ains all the information of your image and uses the free L@@ Z@@ W com@@ pression . &quot;
&quot; if you are planning to edit your pictures frequently or you later use later otherwise , you should not choose the JP@@ EG format before the image quality is deterior@@ ating . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better customized to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JP@@ EG as storage format , the met@@ ad@@ ata are included in the RA@@ W file in the JP@@ EG file in the P@@ W file . &quot;
&quot; when you have adjusted your settings , you can start converting the conversion . if you want to break this process again , you can use this process again . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ ile processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing in a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; however , the available settings are virtually identical to the version for individual images . however , this is useful if this is produced in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available as far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to re@@ com@@ press all pictures in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used for ren@@ aming of all images of an album , you can use the pre@@ fix , the number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the tim@@ est@@ amp . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it is used to enlarge or enlarge the picture below . you can enlarge the picture or enlarge 4 types of the images :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size changes in two dimensions . this option remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : dis@@ proportionate size changes in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; printing preparation : preparing the image for the photo pressure . the user can set the print resolution and the size of the phot@@ op@@ api@@ ers . the target picture , including back@@ size , ver@@ size and back@@ color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the lower images previously . further pictures can draw on the list of the images and put it there .
&quot; after which you started the module , the images can be displayed with the pictures selected by you . over the button pictures you can add more pictures with a file op@@ tionally dialog . for the last shown picture , a preview is displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and add it to the list of the images you want to add .
&quot; with the button images remove the selected images from the list of the images are removed . &quot;
after you have selected all pictures OK with the button OK the new news -@@ window of your e @-@ mail address . you only need to add the addresses and the bed@@ ding . the pictures selected are attached to you as an app@@ endi@@ x .
do not pay attention to many images at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations to the size of the e @-@ mails . it may possibly be a good idea to send multiple mails if you wish to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used each time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify in the input field below the correct path for your installation . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer before . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after your selection of comments in a raised file , the comments to the images are put together into a text file and attached the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the abandoned formats such as T@@ IF@@ F . you should therefore have P@@ NG and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise we recommend you to JP@@ EG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JP@@ EG under pictures file format and are the original files in JP@@ EG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the lower images . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not automatically closed the status messages , in search of errors , can be seen . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the button of closing , you can get this window t@@ lie ? &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Fort@@ une advanced Di@@ ash@@ au , a window will be shown with questions as you want your di@@ asch@@ au . you can choose between you selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option OpenGL transitions in presentation will use very elegant pictures via OpenGL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card , as otherwise the di@@ asch@@ au will be very slow . &quot;
the option fil@@ en@@ ames show that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the pictures in the left corner will be shown during the presentation .
the option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an end@@ setting loop . you can then break it manually with es@@ c .
the option images acci@@ dentally choose that the pictures are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album .
&quot; under delay between the images it is set to be set between individual images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should be able to show your presentation to your friends ! &quot;
there is more than a dozen transitions @-@ effects between which you can choose . by chance there is a different effect on every transition between images .
&quot; during the Di@@ ash@@ au , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn off . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can hold the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the sli@@ deshow . &quot;
&quot; on the left of the screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ames , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ e.@@ org. You : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background picture is a tool to put an image as the background image for the work@@ space .
&quot; this module supports the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of sub@@ menu , as the background for your KDE work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; photo album ; by this brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the picture , then in individuals , places and in group key@@ word entries are available . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you see the categories , for which you have information entered when you look to your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are additional items to look to EX@@ IF @-@ based information and of course look to the current pictures . in the following , each one is described for itself . &quot;
&quot; when you press with the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select a further person , only the images are displayed on which both individuals are to be seen . through this selection method , you can limit the number of photos of a few thousand images to a few single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the persons , places and other settings , you can view photos to look at the pictures of your field . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol before its name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can store his own image , which is of course also defined for places , keywords and other categories that you yourself have defined . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the name , select the button you need to adjust the right outside on the tool@@ bar . this has the advantage that you can view the view for each category separately ( if you do not have a list of key@@ word ( if you do not have a suitable picture for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you must choose which picture for each individual person will be displayed . to view this , you need to display the picture @-@ sight@@ ed window below . now you can select the picture below for the corresponding person . in the sight@@ se@@ er window you can custom@@ ize the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and thus select which part of the picture will be shown or cut off . &quot;
&quot; if you call in the main window the entry Su@@ chen , a dialog will display the dialog for the celebration of the picture properties very similar . this dialog can be seen in the picture again . &quot;
&quot; if you want to enter a drawing in the field of lab@@ eling or description , the fittings and descriptions of the pictures after this text is seeking ; the date may also be part of the overall date , i.e. for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; browse the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all pictures after certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , is not Anne Hel@@ ene pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; free photo album ; if you do not like to read manu@@ als , but rather try to try out the functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and check out the fast entry into the screens@@ hot and the introduc@@ tory videos .
&quot; start &amp; free photo album ; and choose the first dialogue the demo , in case you start on the photo album ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help the menu entry format ; then a few examples are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a continuous HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar you can see here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you data statistics about the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the time bar can show you several different time units . each bar displays a different unit . you can change between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you see a part of a database by stopping only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the time bar lets you use the following ways : you can change the displayed photo view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date is displayed in the preview file ) and also displays the current date of the currently shown images if you navigate in the preview display . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of the tim@@ eline by pressing the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the time bar , i.e. if you select an area only pictures of this period . you can pick the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; introduces you two options available to create HTML files with your images . one is integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user &apos;s manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create over the menu file HTML ... call .
&quot; before using HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first enter the title of the over@@ looks and a description which is intended to contain the HTML file later . on cold album ; HTML @-@ example , see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; cold album ; export file is to be created on the overview page . transfer information about export files can be found in . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed . therefore , you can avoid that information can be displayed on the viewer . for example , that all pictures are exported from a party . for example , that all pictures are exported from a party . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clearly , so this is not specifically given . &quot;
&quot; in the bottom of the page you can adjust various resolutions to the pictures . therefore , those who have to look at your website and possess a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images , for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your side may change the resolution at any time , so you can set your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission period , as well . if it wants to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setup , you place the different folder and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; best to choose for all your HTML files , a basic folder and for each subsequent sentence a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first you have to select the main folder in which all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and you can select for all future pictures of the location . here you can choose either a folder or one of KDE released protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check whether these truly are all for viewers . if you have been created for the basics , a web browser will be started . the URL you should specify here , should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the files created by you are not yet displayed in the final destination , you must manually copy it to the final destination . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are . &quot;
&quot; the currently setting options described precisely , all three on base folders or URLs related . in these cases , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you define in output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking at a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo album ; you can of course create a HTML page for viewing the pictures , location , etc . , then you need to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work doesn &apos;t even have to do . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; cable album , you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are used with ex@@ - and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in it whether the pictures themselves are stored with in the file or whether in the file you can only collect all images into the file and that file can pass it independently . the obvious disadvantage is however the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the menu file ... or together with HTML @-@ pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file is looking for images in two times . first , the images are found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . the corresponding pictures are not found , so the images of the URL you have created when creating the HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file via HTML @-@ Export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , dialogue for export images described you can export over the menu file ... call . &quot;
the main option of this dialog is to act as if it is an internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three options available :
&quot; in the option Manual in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file , you must copy the pictures in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
with the option Autom@@ atic near the .@@ k@@ im file copy and k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . as most of the pictures already com@@ pressed to JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not the files to com@@ press . if you like this , just select the option export file . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is maxim@@ ally image size . if you want to send your friends pictures , since the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise very large . here you can limit the size by saying that every picture is at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; when you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file Im@@ ported ... select , will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in the file . &quot;
&quot; the assistant to mim@@ ic consists of four steps . first you have to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import images are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you are called the category persons to the import@@ ing file person@@ er ( if you are a sw@@ ans ) , while this category are asked for your database . therefore , you will be imported in the third dialogue window , which are to be imported into the database and which categories they comply with your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step you can import the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . one example , you can see an example on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it has to be easy to browse and look at : if you look at pictures , you can often look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend about it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find the different steps from ( 1 ) Fes@@ tive information about your pictures , about ( 2 ) the passage and pres@@ tige , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adaptation options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program for the administration of your pictures . but it has been extended and today , it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is spoken about pictures , but often this also includes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; all its information contained in the file index@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file , which you can use with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , you can copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where they would like . &quot;
&quot; on the folder , stored in which your images are stored and used it automatically again . if you want to read another database in &amp; cold album , so you can start another folder , with the option -@@ c . as example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / index@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; via the menu entry order settings k@@ photo@@ album ; Set up to a window , with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following sections of the user manual , the various settings will be explained . &quot;
&quot; left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call settings options for viewing and watching the options for the viewer . for each setting , you can call for a detailed help , which you can call by clicking on the F1 button and click on the option you want . &quot;
&quot; it was described as you can choose different properties , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as items , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog , which is used to already handle existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a lab@@ eling and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub @-@ categories have already mentioned . in dialog , you can set full members groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a medi@@ gli@@ eds as in explained . &quot;
&quot; to see the settings options available , you can choose to select the members groups . with the above selection list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window you want to configure a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his modular system with other graphics applications such as digi@@ li@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this modul@@ ation means K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin Interface . information about this can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
&quot; the modules can be called modules via the modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules own a help page that you can call on the modules itself . &quot;
&quot; because the modules can be shared with each other among each other , it may be that the modules are tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the demo database can always be tested first with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . do not say , I would not have been warned ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules on K@@ IP@@ I together , are very different , making it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported in albums : this kind of order is not supported , simul@@ ated it for some modules the order after albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all images that show you the picture show at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the current album &quot; &quot; album album &quot; &quot; album , the modules also has to pass a list of albums . here is a photo album , as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will have the category that you &apos;ve specified in the input dialog as a category for virtual albums . therefore , if you have for example the category people will use it , so that if you have selected individuals for viewing and to pass this to the module . &quot;
&quot; because some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select in the module modules that are supposed to be loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see an example of a Start@@ ing screen , once you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other KDE application , you can see the window at the top of a menu and a tool@@ bar . below the tool@@ bar , you &apos;ll find no information about your images added . in the section we will not show some information about your images , but now please click on the following photos , which shows you an overview with all existing images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to provide any picture with notes , where the image has been taken , etc . you can bet each image separately or for a larger number of images certain notes at the same time . if for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all the pictures in Copenhagen were recorded . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for seeking and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes when you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; see three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo album ; because you can always use it again if you want information about your images . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to conf@@ use the pictures within the list : if you have for example a family party , and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people are de@@ formed , you can find that the names used to move up to the top , the persons quickly find and assign . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to receive an alphabe@@ tical list , click on the icon for you to date on the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected comments on each image individually , you might want to edit all of the selected images and add these pictures with notes . click on the front and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture right . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be convenient to highlight all these images and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . besides , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is a head@@ group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the assessment dialogue is it possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also create an entry simply on a category and place there to sort this to an sub@@ category of this entry . respect , this requires that you just sort out your categories alphabe@@ tically . see . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the dialogue , by setting up the b@@ ust of the frame , click and move . you can also make your own window from a frame by moving it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs , you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... , which offers you the possibility to store the current structure and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also leave a frame completely out . if you want to get this window later , use the button options ... and then click the window to see this process in the picture . &quot;
&quot; when you select the entry pictures in the browser , you will get an overview with pres@@ umb@@ nails the currently selected images , or any images if you do not have a filter . one example can see the size of the umb@@ nails , configure the mouse button with the middle mouse button , configure . try it just . &quot;
&quot; when you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; if you click on a picture , this is displayed in the image editing . if you still don &apos;t have a window with a photo panel , a new indicator is created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete images in the picture . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press the Edit menu . now , you will see the window that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use it , without you on your hard disk . of course , you have to record the images somewhere , so that you can record the pictures anywhere . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; pictures , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for example , the pictures are 5 @-@ 9 . however , the images are available for pictures . however , the preview of these images can be seen . however , you can also look at the pictures with the pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you see , this function needs you to copy files from the folders and then copy it . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , it does not support you to specify the question of the concerned CD . so if you want to avoid any hass@@ le of your images , please buy a larger disk in order to save all pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the menu pictures you can find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you can see the images that you may want to see other in@@ accessible and click on Cur@@ rent View all except to pick up your little sister , anst@@ eu@@ ing and menu entry . &quot;
&quot; so you have set out which pictures in the case of the case should be hidden . if you wish to give the laptop now your little sister , select the menu entry to be locked . if you want to get the pictures again , click lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password that must be entered . to set up this password , just choose password in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; please note that this picture protection is not at all very safe . for instance , all the images on the hard disk and to the other can be able to read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted document . this type of password protection serves only those who are familiar with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar with the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you want to describe all your pictures with &amp; free photo album ; of course , manage and hours over hours with it is of course that you want to see them at some point . for this reason , you can see them at some point . for this reason , you can start a picture _ and video @-@ view . you can start from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer you can see in . he naturally shows the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ Box is on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can easily drag it with the mouse . you can also configure what information is displayed and if all information is displayed on the viewer . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . then , the context menu can be seen below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ Box are underlined . if you click on this browser , see the appropriate entries to this display . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected individuals from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded several pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them and go back by using the buttons picture high and picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also accessible from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run these as di@@ ash@@ au . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image after a few seconds . started to press the Str@@ g Taste and Plus or Min@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , you can switch to the full mode of view . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the entry button to switch in full mode and back . &quot;
&quot; if you use the viewer , you can use the image inside and zo@@ oming . to the Her@@ oes button , you can easily re@@ construct a rect@@ angle . with the minus button you can see again r@@ aus@@ zo@@ oming The Plus button zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the picture . shows how a z@@ oom rect@@ angle is highlighted and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point button , you can reset your z@@ oom so that the image does not appear to be zo@@ omed . with the equation F@@ ight sets the zo@@ oms , so that every pi@@ xel is on the screen to a pi@@ xel of the image . &quot;
&quot; note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work in videos that work in and out zo@@ oming , with the plus and points . &quot;
with the rotation functions from the context menu you can rot@@ ate the picture . this does not work with videos . you can notes to the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu .
&quot; if you look at pictures , you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . in the moment you can preview the picture and enter the configuration of the picture to mark this name . however , it may be prefer@@ able only to mark the picture and look at the picture . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer in order to get the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want to start watching the spect@@ ator with the images and mark it as good or bad , while one can see one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above there are the viewers the possibility of providing pictures with features , while you can watch them . features are the letters A to Z and you can put a characteristic that you press the corresponding letter . see a picture in which the characteristics A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have any features to your pictures , you can see in your browser . so if you have selected all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the view view . if you view categories in dre @-@ view view , then you can simply press the letter for the characteristic when the image was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you to paint on the image .
&quot; the painting is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can post your mind later . &quot;
in you can see a picture on the painted album . to switch to the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; select on the picture paint from the context menu . to end the painting you simply hit the cross in the tool@@ bar top of the window .
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; work to work , you must not fully control the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; but the documentation of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you be read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are shown in the properties Properties , and the object is shown in the wire views . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple items at the same time . but not the sub@@ object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ properties are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu one . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following up @-@ menu appears , so that you can choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with delet@@ ing either from the menu bar under mach@@ ining , or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can also remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click on applying these modifications . do you have invali@@ d values , then a message is displayed with a error description . then you can click on the input holes and apply it again , or use the changes to break down . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user @-@ documentation in the interior dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the requested object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains already the user &apos;s documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the original view . &quot;
&quot; press Pre@@ view in the Fe@@ atur@@ ts view and a small example of the scene is selected with the chosen texture , even if you want to have selected an sub@@ ordin@@ ated item ( for example a texture inside an texture map and not the entire texture map ) , you cross locally . &quot;
the screens@@ hot shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wi@@ red view . this cross marks the centre of sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift through pul@@ ling with the mouse within the whole window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a visual stage . you can specify this value relatively to the higher level of the higher object or as absolute value . objects will only appear , if they are selected or their visibility of visibility of the chosen visibility of the scene . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window @-@ format as default . the object tree and the view of object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window order , or if you need any other arrangement , you can set it as possible . you can also save multiple window orders and easily switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or under a present view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange several views over one another , drag the starter in the middle of another view . you can then change between the views by clicking on the cardboard card top in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window order are sch@@ os@@ sing views : views which are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to view a view from the anchor , drag the starter on the desktop or click the small to the left corner left at the top left . &quot;
&quot; to view a view , click on the small cross in the An@@ fi@@ ser@@ bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu View you will find entries for any type of views . new views are sch@@ os@@ sing , you can anchor them to any position . &quot;
&quot; the current window view can save you with a window window ... save . it will be displayed , where you can save the window , under an existing or new name . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to ren@@ dering , this program has to be properly installed . as this manual is written , &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; Version 1.0 are not supported . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the icon ren@@ dering ren@@ dering ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu option scene ren@@ dering . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . he determines the image size and the quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to insert a scene in different picture sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di , from a quick preview to full @-@ pictures in the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the symbol The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar , or in the menu View R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... choose the following dialog : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that can recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in map map size , you can enter the width and height of the framed image . if you want only to enter a small area of the image , select the cross section below and enter the picture @-@ section to Ren@@ ov@@ ations into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in the combination field quality you can select the properties , which is used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering , this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user refl@@ ections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user &apos;s manual and Pov@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; if a picture is caused by just one ray each pixels , there are often different mistakes . these images often have a mos@@ quit@@ ous pattern or ste@@ pl@@ ings in cur@@ ves and lines , sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than one pi@@ xel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally see pictures with this property better .
if you dis@@ able anti @-@ ali@@ asing and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pi@@ xel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive , the second method is adap@@ tive and adap@@ tive , because each pi@@ xel is constantly re@@ designed and adap@@ tive because each pi@@ xel will depend on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; when you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray hit a beam depending on the pixels . if the difference between color values will be processed with super @-@ sampling . if you adjust the repository to 4 additional points , a height of 4x@@ 4 additional points will be calculated , at a low level of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pi@@ xel will be calculated : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixels , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pi@@ xel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pi@@ xel . if the difference between color values exce@@ eds the pre @-@ determined threshold , then the pi@@ xel is split into 4 sub@@ pi@@ xel , which can be trac@@ ed separately and to further sub@@ ordinate . the maximum depth of records can be set by lowering . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is to create smoking for the ray process , called J@@ ant@@ ing . if you turn off , changed &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the final setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use Lich@@ tre@@ adm@@ on . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this map , you can set whether the Alpha channels will be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pi@@ xel is then transparent , if the associated rays did not have an object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for viewing the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; connection issue . if &amp; Pov@@ ray is finished , you can find the reason for this here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ scene to import , select the menu option Im@@ ported ... and select a file in dialogue window . &quot;
currently &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er has not yet supported the full command of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; if checking bug fixes or war@@ nings display a dialog window lists a list of all announ@@ cements .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ End .
&quot; you can export objects from the object tree in the editor to export the code text for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object to import text file in the editor , just highlight the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ dering . usually this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
&quot; click on the Help in the Fe@@ atur@@ ts view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentary about the requested object . put the path to your document@@ ations and the version . will be supported by version 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example , al@@ ph@@ ur data ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you refer files in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used . &quot;
the color of the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the Control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected checks .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the visible field in the camera view and in the window type labels .
&quot; you can adjust the object of the points to the button @-@ button in the context menu of the wire @-@ model views . you can adjust here the tube separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire , and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the indicated objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the detailed stage for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the high level of detailed proj@@ ections , all the wire model views are further divided when the camera is an extended projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and the sen@@ k@@ right proj@@ ections . this property results in better r@@ appro@@ ch@@ ement for proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering . &quot;
&quot; when you show walls , a wall is shown behind the objects . the wall is shown in a chess pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you show ground cross@@ ings , a ground below the objects is rounded . the floor is represented in a chess pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you activate Kant@@ engl@@ ish@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti ali@@ asing method is used for ren@@ dering the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . more precise information about the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di . &quot;
&quot; on this page you can create existing window orders or create new window orders . in the section of window , it is explained how to create a window @-@ box and save . &quot;
the combination @-@ setting standard window : displays all existing window regulations . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window order at the start of the program .
&quot; the list of available window systems displays all the available window orders . a new arrangement , you can create and delete a selected alignment with the button remo@@ ves . &quot;
each window of window is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views of the chosen window order . new views can create and delete selected views with the button removal .
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ cover the windows under the existing window , with card card , you will see a cardboard card solution together with the previous view and sch@@ os@@ sing the view does not anch@@ ored in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just got &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you would like to follow more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should make the ultimate scene , among beginners , very popular : a ball on one plane . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings , please feel that you can only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not setup a camera , no rules can be applied to ren@@ dering , as a result you get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you do not fit light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything out of error , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following collection of window : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you can expect an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will have to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; start with a simple scene . to remove this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item editing . you now have a scene without objects .
the wi@@ re@@ viewing model shows how the camera sees the whole scene which you generate . especially notice the scene from the view of the camera . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the contents of the view properties tab , where the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user &apos;s documentation about &amp; Pov@@ ray you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; change nothing at the basic settings of the camera , this may be reserved for instructions , but note that the camera is able to change control points with which you can change the way@@ point of the camera . simply click on a check@@ point and draw it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; if you apply the button or press En@@ ter , the wire model views and the object tree immediately change these settings . as a result , they see here the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could insert for example a qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body quot@@ a ) and the size of x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an comprehen@@ sible method of solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite layer as a ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the plane in the object tree , change the name and press the button . in the object tree the new name is immediately displayed . &quot;
&quot; the wi@@ at view now shows the level , even if at the moment only as a limited plain . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the level extends to horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the object tree exactly , you will find that you can click the entry for the bottom , if you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case , you can see the different parameters for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in view of the properties Properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move to the bottom of the exercise a unit below the horizon , so that you can get to know some of these parameters . select the shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; only select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but select at the moment a little cre@@ ek . &quot;
&quot; in both cases a dialog will open , where the object is to be inserted . please select the name in the object tree ( name = ground @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview , see how the pig@@ ment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments shows only a Matt@@ es black material , because you can still need settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , consider the colors for the pig@@ ment . also give it a lot of possibilities now , but take the easiest way . &quot;
&quot; if you do not see color on qu@@ ader and ball , just click on the button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the ground is now properly adjusted . if you ren@@ dering your picture by clicking on the icon , you should get the following results : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the color list . here are further settings necessary . in the color list you must enter two new attributes , select this entry twice ( you can do this even more frequently , but the Chess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; select in the object tree every time , and change the colors in the view of the properties Properties : &quot;
this step should you already be able to run easily since you should have understood the fundamental working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball is just as simple as the ground can be created :
&quot; in view of object Properties , you can instantly change the settings . put the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the bul@@ lets contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would fluctu@@ ate over the ground , as you have shifted the ground to move one unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , the ren@@ dering act now a strange outcome : as before , the ball surface as a Matt@@ es black material . put in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material as it is on the ground , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as a color : &quot;
&quot; select First sub @-@ object and change the name for example in the ball pig@@ ment . click on the ball pig@@ ment , select then plain @-@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can reach more interesting effects , if you take the time to set some finish properties : &quot;
then change the values as in the following screens@@ hot and click on it or press En@@ ter .
&quot; the Settings gl@@ eam and reflection result in partial visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ mium @-@ pl@@ ating surfaces , even if metal : still not selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you have &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers . hopefully you have learned so much , you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tr@@ ay@@ cing is a ration@@ ale method to create a two @-@ dimensional scene of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; if you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en that sho@@ ots up the ren@@ derer hyp@@ othe@@ tical string from the perspective of the beh@@ older . i.e. from the camera , the scenes by the objects refl@@ ecting and broke , the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how to operate atmospheric effects such as neb@@ ula . thus , the scene is dealt with pi@@ xel for pi@@ xel . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is just black . obviously , every scene needs to be absorbed , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and replaced the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already stored the model , it is called under the same name . it is a new file , you must enter a name and space . &quot;
the scene in the final saved version reflects . all changes since the last storage will be rejected .
&quot; this menu , you can only select this menu , if you do not have stored changes in the scene . &quot;
&quot; repeatedly , the last one command . this menu entry is only then select if you are using editing . &quot;
saves the current window order and opens a dialog by entering a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the appearance , the short@@ cuts and the standard behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard abbrevi@@ ations . you can change or add new releases by this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; commands and add new orders .
opens up a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove tool@@ boxes with this option tool@@ bar for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er .
&quot; a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to pre@@ ach the surface finishes , without any b@@ ump on the surface individually modeling and without change the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself . &quot;
it is usual to use the same file for a B@@ ump @-@ Map as well as for a texture map .
&quot; elementary shapes are simple geomet@@ rical shapes , which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from do@@ zens or even hundreds of these basic body . these models will then be edited , to give them a realistic look . &quot;
&quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on a pi@@ xel basis , by applying a picture file as colour card . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a more comfortable sculp@@ tor and navig@@ ator . the application has a file browser , where you can choose images to display . &quot;
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full @-@ screen mode .
&quot; the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files , which you can display with On the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the button return . &quot;
&quot; you can set whether any picture is to be displayed in a separate window , or if all images are always used to use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the file in the browser window . if an appropriate fil@@ en@@ ame was highlighted , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing the Return of Return or Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialogue of setup - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; setting in the two other , short @-@ command for the browser , you can set the short@@ cuts for the respective window . &quot;
&quot; this is selected , then the pictures in full mode is open . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the ad surface is filled with the background color that you can further down . pres@@ et is not a full @-@ screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you can still watch the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is particularly suitable for a sli@@ deshow . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when drawing the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored beams to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full mode . if in window mode , the window is bigger than the picture , the background is filled with the chosen color . &quot;
you can set &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; so set up that only a few of the file types are shown that the program can also be displayed .
&quot; with this option , the scor@@ eboard is increased to the full screen . this option is switched as default . &quot;
sets out whether the sli@@ deshow with the first image should start in the folder or with the selected image .
the time span between visual change in a slide show . to change the value you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ ders on the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
&quot; the number of repeti@@ tions . this value is set to 0 , will change the sli@@ deshow as long as it will be off from the user . to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ ders on the right next to the input field . the default is 1 . &quot;
change the short@@ cuts for the various modes of work by &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in cardboard cards short @-@ command for the indicator and short @-@ command for the browser .
&quot; with this option , turn off between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ es@@ ystem ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the fil@@ es@@ ystem with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays great symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short @-@ time position .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short @-@ time position .
shows view@@ points for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short @-@ time position .
the size is reduced by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .
the image increased by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the picture .
&quot; closes the display panel for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show , is also closed if no browser window is opened more . &quot;
the image in original size displays . this is only useful if the automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
&quot; opens the input field for understanding . enter the first character of the file , which you are looking for . if the file is found , it is selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ photo processing based on the &amp; Pres@@ ent ; sculp@@ ting . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of &amp; Pres@@ ent ; project .
the show@@ photo ; is a quick image editing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to look out and carry out some pictures and correc@@ tions and modifications .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on that the user contribute to it , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this page shows you as easy as possible errors or possible improvements . if you use it , the menu features a link to reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already filled , and you can simply follow the instructions to prevent your message . &quot;
&quot; the show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that is , that users and developers can help each other by &amp; show@@ photo . if you have a more common user of &amp; show@@ photo . however , in this mailing list , you &apos;ll be able to reply to other users of &amp; show@@ photo . however , in this mailing list , you should therefore be powerful . &quot;
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; it is the developer mailing list to appear . you can join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo .
&quot; the show@@ photo ; try to give you as much control over its operations as possible . there are many options that connect the behaviour of &amp; show@@ photo . to set up on these settings , you must change in the menu settings show@@ photo . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left . &quot;
&quot; in the area of sealing indicators you can select the colour , which is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ load indicators , the colors should show with what you should show , in contrast , a bright colour and over@@ exposure a dark color should be displayed . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions on selected images . the same side bar can also be found in image editing . you can view it in which you click on one of the five riders : &quot;
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for sc@@ ans of images that does not make more than images to scan and comment .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for sc@@ ans of images that can no longer power as pictures to scan and save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also save the pictures before the check .
you can check the status of the support of your scanner on the SAN@@ E project by checking the necessary information on this search page : http : / / www.s@@ ane @-@ project@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog to choose the scanner is opened . &quot;
&quot; the user can select the sc@@ oring scanner and press , to open the scanner . breaking down &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite . &quot;
the further settings contain more det@@ a@@ illed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) covers these options not particularly .
&quot; to record a picture , the user can only start a pre @-@ sch@@ ath@@ can and then start scanning for the final scan . the incident can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to select the image better the user can enter into the image and out of the current range of zo@@ oming . it can also set the z@@ oom as well , that the complete preview fits in the window . &quot;
when the image was selected then the final picture can be read with the scan button .
&quot; when you see a preview display in the settings , then the image is shown in a showcase , as is shown below , then the image will be saved and shot ? en leads to a break@@ down and you will get back into the main window . &quot;
&quot; by the kno@@ b settings , the same @-@ named dialog will be opened before the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before stor@@ ing . in this case the option must be selected before stor@@ ing a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be chosen . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; pictures stores to select the dialog before each image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , it is automatically saved with an un@@ generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must be saved without a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the pictures are saved at the option without saving a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , this folder is used as standard for dialogue to save . the standard value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... change . &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a pre@@ fix for the automatically mem@@ ent@@ ment images and is also the proposed name for the image in dialog for stor@@ ing . the automatically stored image gets a numer@@ ical addiction mix of each time , when a picture is saved . the string Chain # # # will be replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adapt to the stor@@ ing image quality . this value also changes the com@@ pression value in saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the standard value is used by Q@@ t . &quot;
the kno@@ b help starts the KDE Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the Kno@@ pf About the KDE About @-@ Di@@ alogue for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button of the button displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to stop &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is licensed under the GPL and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library that is used by &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; caution : li@@ bs@@ ane is under the GPL with an exception .
you can set up a list of these cuts and function . below you will set up a list of these cuts and their function . you will set up a list of these cuts in the player window and select glob@@ als key@@ chain . select the right mouse button in the player window and select the short@@ list ... select the mouse button .
you may set up existing multimedia buttons so set that they work as &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; -@@ free commands . so you make your keyboard to the &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which are mostly also available in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , play@@ back , play@@ lists and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function break &amp; eg ; so look : &quot;
&quot; AMAR@@ OK supports the command @-@ lines of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ o@@ ok has some own commands options . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script should not be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script , if all necessary modules are present and take advantage of the dialog , so that the user authorization , why a script does not run . &quot;
Beg@@ in require &apos; Kor@@ un@@ dum &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ un@@ dum ( KDE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is so for this script . &apos; c@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
&quot; in the folder Scrip@@ ts / you will find a lot of template script in many different languages . you can use it as the basis for your own scripts , or simply extend it to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing of scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ o@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which everyone should join KDE installation . &quot;
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the trigger of external programs and commands . this is usually called Ex@@ ec ( ) function . this way can d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy to be called . here is an example in Python :
&quot; AMAR@@ OK ; sends aler@@ ts to all running scripts . for this reason , strings on the default output of the script should be continuously monitored and responding to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to view the tool dialog . to view the stor@@ ing and loading of the furnishings , each script should take care . if a script should be started , Amar@@ ok uses the work@@ folder on the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
tr@@ ack@@ change sign@@ alized that a new piece is tr@@ acked . the script could now ask for example ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions further information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the stra@@ w length ) .
vol@@ um@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume sign@@ alized a change of volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ize : sub@@ menu item@@ ized : sub@@ menu item@@ ized the path to the selected files of the playlist if a user @-@ defined menu item d@@ co@@ p does d@@ co@@ p AMAR@@ OK script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu item@@ Tit@@ le ) .
&quot; before &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; stop , or when the user stops a script , sends and AMAR@@ OK ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to work for example o@@ fr@@ aming work . for example , the saving of data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ oks script management can also install script packages that have downloaded the user &amp; eg ; for example ; such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) which can also be op@@ tionally available with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , so that the user can clearly see the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package . &quot;
&quot; AMAR@@ OK ; 1.3 is accepted only script packages with the Ex@@ ung@@ ing amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should immediately name your script packages right . &quot;
&quot; the main thing must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining for lad@@ der modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter to get the file rights : &quot;
&quot; if your script is ready , you can rech@@ arge it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and link to the Wik@@ i script page of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; start your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category AMAR@@ OK ; script . &quot;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; AMAR@@ OK , you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . perhaps you will find just a very specific title from thousands of coming in your collection . with &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; &apos; s collection @-@ browser and the quick @-@ looking search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you have already decide some play@@ lists , but you can never decide what you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists can still be hard for you . and if your decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the intelligent play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to specific criteria . &quot;
&quot; AMAR@@ OK has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many general USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used to listen to your music . it &apos;s OK , sexy and fancy - just the right to re@@ experience your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually , you have to type in the base folder of Amar@@ ok @-@ sources , to compile and install Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake you should have no trouble passing . if you encounter any problems , please report them in the &amp; none ; mail@@ ing@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; just like most applications , some options that you can activate or dis@@ able with the configure script using the configure script . this is a list of options available . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iler options must be met certain dependen@@ cies , so that they can be used . details can be found in the section system requirements . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bug@@ ging icons . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; AMAR@@ OK , you should use full . &quot;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; can be set up without trouble on the dialog dialog . the dialog dialog has several boxes to assem@@ ble the various functions of &amp; AMAR@@ OK .
&quot; player page displays the player page in addition to the playlist , or out . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists are sho@@ wn@@ along . &quot;
&quot; use bar@@ ometer : this feature is only available , if &amp; AMAR@@ OK , compiled with support for m@@ oo@@ doo . the option turns the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; atmospheric design : this feature is only available , if &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; with support for m@@ oo@@ doo compiled . by this , the colour scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer is changed . &quot;
&quot; voting files in the music files , this feature is only available if &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; with support for m@@ oo@@ doo compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files in the Settings folder of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / AMAR@@ OK / m@@ oo@@ able / ) . &quot;
&quot; external browser : lets you choose which browser is run by &amp; AMAR@@ OK , when a browser is needed . &quot;
&quot; use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above . &quot;
&quot; play@@ back playlist , save the current playlist automatically at the loading of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; select this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist upon completion . &quot;
&quot; relative paths to manually stored play@@ lists : when you activate this setting , it will use it &apos;s OK ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; up @-@ to @-@ date pieces of the piece @-@ change can be seen , that the playlist window will be visible , in order to keep the current piece always in the visible window range . &quot;
&quot; when connecting to the context @-@ browser changes automatically the context @-@ browser , automatically displays the context @-@ browser to the next piece . &quot;
in the section appearance you can adjust &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; s appearance is divided into three parts .
&quot; in the fonts section , you can use the use of various fonts in &amp; AMAR@@ OK . you can select fonts for the following section : play@@ lists windows , player window and context @-@ browser . press to select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of user @-@ defined color scheme , you have to define the qu@@ al of choice and can specify a separate color scheme . use this among the activated colours for front and background color . &quot;
&quot; play back in the start brings that &amp; AMAR@@ OK , after the program start playing automatically with the piece on the place , with which they stopped at the last stop . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display will enable you to use the O@@ SD screen . if on @-@ screen display is , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is the font . click on select ... to select from the dialog box type for the O@@ SD . the cross @-@ box shadow causes that the text in O@@ SD sh@@ aded is shown .
&quot; use own colors will give you the opportunity to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . a click on the color surfaces opens the dialog to select colour choices . if necessary colors do not be activated , the pre @-@ placed &amp; cold colors are used . &quot;
the input field text displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . through the input of space the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below is a list of available space holders and what they mean .
&quot; the option screen is intended for X@@ inj@@ ama users , so you can specify , on which screen of a multi @-@ screen monitor environment the O@@ SD will appear . &quot;
the card @-@ card audio @-@ output lets you select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers are activ@@ ating further settings in this card @-@ card .
the card @-@ card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , select &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; to search for music files . to select a folder into the collection , select the cross @-@ box next to its name . this section also contains anch@@ oring fields to capture , as with the selected folders . &quot;
sub@@ folder : this causes that &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders to search .
&quot; changes : allows &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
play@@ lists import : causes that &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection then appear later in the play@@ lists .
&quot; the part of collecting database is used for selecting a database for the collection . the combination @-@ field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected , another facility is needed in the Sub@@ si@@ ql setup . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ ql set is used for setting the database for &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; used under machine : the machine is entered , under port : the network user is entered , under which the database is att@@ ain@@ able . name : is the Database name , which the connection is made . &quot;
use user name : and password : for input data that are needed for the connection to the database .
the card @-@ card @-@ cat@@ .@@ f@@ m will provide support for duty .@@ f@@ m . &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; can provide the names of played mos@@ quit@@ oes to a duty .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
&quot; here , enter your username and password for your duty use . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
&quot; sending pieces and thus update the profile : this setting makes it &amp; AMAR@@ OK , to transmit the names of the played pieces to your duty .@@ f@@ m profile . &quot;
similar interpre@@ ters are retri@@ eve : after activ@@ ating this setting will call &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters appear to the each played piece . note : you can use the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a load @-@ profile profile to use this function .
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; eg ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with the screens@@ hot .
&quot; AMAR@@ OK needs only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other KDE packages . you need to have K@@ deli@@ bs installed separately ( including those included in it ) , because &amp; AMAR@@ OK , requires some of them , for example modules or scripts . we have written a small guide , as you can compile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some features such as O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ oses that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . gn@@ omes will therefore work , but flu@@ x@@ box will help , for example , we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ b library . you can check out the file by typ@@ ing in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / AMAR@@ OK / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log on . afterwards you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly it is that Tag@@ lib when reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file cr@@ ashes . please report this bug to the Tag@@ b developers below bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; is somewhat more mature . &quot;
&quot; be sure all of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; AMAR@@ OK , Tag@@ li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x compiled , then this leads to overthrow at the mach@@ ining of met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; when you use KDE using art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate automatic . off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least not a value of 1 second . &quot;
you can also send us the back@@ trace per e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail is automatically open with a crash ) . if it is a common withdrawal and send us a good back@@ trace back , the error is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because lots of program data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 to the met@@ a @-@ info feature , but these are not considered Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / perl the &quot; The file $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ day ( $ v@@ 2@@ day , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ E &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; s Symb@@ ols in the stat@@ us@@ bar ( random mode / repeat / Dynam@@ ics playlist ) can be found in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can use the symbols de@@ activated on grey and semi @-@ transparent . notice that in some cases it is necessary to click on a symbol until this setting has its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ oc@@ app : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map . you can check whether AMAR@@ OK the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ sch@@ amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ atory Q@@ t @-@ version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that AMAR@@ OK will find the correct version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most of the installation problems clarify along the easiest way through the help of a expert your Uni@@ xes or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or with the developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # AMAR@@ OK .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please enter there only one mistake if you find something at the fl@@ itting of a bug in AMAR@@ OK itself .
after the start of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; appears only a blank playlist . how do they come into music pieces ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively the start @-@ sub@@ window was converted into the Statisti@@ cs window . you can find it under extr@@ as statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating through the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces must be displayed in the playlist the rating column . click anywhere in the new application column to view the rating for a piece . you can also use the short @-@ command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ o@@ ok is located in the background .
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press Ent@@ f on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your choice and then select from playlist menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist , and let them fall exactly as you would also do it with other files . &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , just next to the add button , is the button to save play@@ back playlist . click on it . &quot;
probably you get the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the package x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; new . take a look after lib@@ visual , this package contains a lot of very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations . &quot;
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore you can find it via the menu bar below extr@@ as E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; no . yes , this really is true ! none ! &amp; AMAR@@ OK , uses the actual issue loud Wh@@ ich media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ins / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we can even support text and P@@ NG . &quot;
&quot; it can ! maybe use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which with the default setting no MP3 @-@ de@@ coder has been supplied ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , En@@ ter &quot;
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the AL@@ SA S@@ ink , the device must use a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and can be accessed using audio mix@@ er ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix -@@ module for AL@@ SA ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix -@@ module for AL@@ SA . &quot;
&quot; the issue of this command should help you search for the problem of problem and solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to specify a different sin@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ der ) . &quot;
&quot; this does &amp; AMAR@@ OK . do not forget that media is first de@@ coded . G@@ Stre@@ amer is not easy to listen to AL@@ SA . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice if you need a decade or with little over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can spend directly to AL@@ SA , just as well as x@@ ins . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open the Sound Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable Sound@@ server with highest priority ( real time list ) and increase the size of the sound bu@@ ffer ( real point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ ap@@ per su@@ id is set :
&quot; at KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia Co@@ dec@@ s , which can cause b@@ ted play@@ back . read this bug report . enlarge the sound @-@ Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA furnishings , .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either do not use the Arts drivers , but instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ins , or install KDE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the quicker Arts @-@ Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts drivers . use another driver ( the x@@ ins drivers , or reduce the size of the Arts bu@@ ffer in the Control Center and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . the smaller of the bu@@ ffer , the fewer applications respond to visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , pl@@ ung@@ es &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; from . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all components . perform G@@ ST register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( quit AMAR@@ OK before ! ) : - load you down ff@@ m@@ peg to compile and install it . then run the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST register again . now you start &amp; AMAR@@ OK .
please report from bug@@ s.@@ k@@ e.@@ org. If you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes please send it to our mailing list : AMAR@@ OK @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&quot; AMAR@@ OK , is an album of the British Mike classic field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . furthermore , the name of the magic K ... : ) &quot;
thanks D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . place in your calendar program an alarm and let it run with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p AMAR@@ OK player play
&quot; this command leaves &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; running the play@@ back . run before you go to bed , then you get from the gentle pots of music that you stopped in front of bed . &quot;
how to find the current in &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; running titles when you &apos;re on another computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment is present you can proceed as follows . diesel command gives you interpre@@ ter and titles of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user name AMAR@@ OK player now@@
replace IP @-@ address with your IP and your username . this requires that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA is present .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; to be separated from the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent case in the size changing windows .
&quot; the combination of Str@@ g + rights right mouse button puts a piece in the cli@@ ck@@ ier order in queue . through pressing the entrance gate after a search in the playlist , the first search results can be played and the search returned . &quot;
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ ck@@ rich functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the Control Bar ? &quot;
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browsers are to be displayed .
&quot; my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is set on a NFS drive . after the start of AMAR@@ OK , the collection database cannot be created and on the console appear many error messages . what now ? &quot;
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / AMAR@@ OK on a local drive or use amar@@ o@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
&quot; insert the CD one , then click the menu on Audio @-@ CD . it opens up a file browser with multiple folders . to normal checking in the desired destination , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination in a cross @-@ section window . for automatic shut@@ ters , you will be able to mp3 files from folders or og@@ g . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , creat@@ ed@@ ate &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &quot; % 1 &quot; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( , &quot; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( ur@@ l ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically this fits the previous review with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played , the more often the piece has been played , the less influence has every single assessment on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can insert the rating for one piece by clicking on a column button on the play@@ lists in the play@@ lists . there , you can select the rating of a piece as well as all the other attributes , namely by clicking on the piece and edit Edit@@ ors : select the rating also in the dialog of met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;

&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have caused a lot of l@@ int@@ els and thus also a lot of error reports . &quot;
probably has been loaded &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ins or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine these output modules have not to be compiled . you must configure &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; new configure and install .
now I have &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; new installed but the output modules appear still not . and now ?
&quot; probably use a distribution , which is installed separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer are installed separately . the same goes for x@@ ins , you need to install x@@ ins @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to re@@ compile and install it OK . &quot;
I get the mistake G@@ Stre@@ amer Cri@@ tical * * : factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos;t no &apos; .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has compiled with p@@ rel@@ iefs that is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you have to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip of Merlin @-@ TC : users don &apos;t need L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you might compile it OK .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype au@@ dia / mp@@ 4 although the module is installed g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fast .
&quot; to be able to play mp@@ 4 or M4@@ A files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must also be able to install the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time . &quot;
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play a MP3 stream from but the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as system managers G@@ ST register . then start it OK .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card with AMAR@@ OK ?
below settings AMAR@@ OK set up ... Audio @-@ Edition enter the device . typical for example h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
pc@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l@@ .@@ intel@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; enter the dialog dialog from x@@ ins now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output will take place on the USB @-@ sound@@ card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the exhaust , channels and so on ) . &quot;

saves all selected projects . this is the same as if you would call for every single project file .
&quot; closes the current project . if a project is changed and not saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what shall happen . you can then break between saving and changes . besides , you can then break off between stor@@ ing and changes . besides , you can then break off and keep the project so open . &quot;
&quot; includes all selected projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any non @-@ stored project , what should happen to happen , just as if you would have called for each project file . &quot;
&quot; closes all selected projects and finished &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for any non @-@ stored project will be asked , what should happen to happen , as if you had called a file . &quot;
&quot; if you call this entry , you can select about the published dialogue files to add to the project . that &apos;s the same effect in view from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files appear in the base folder . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog &quot; &quot; Burn &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the additional kno@@ b called burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to burning the medium ; the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many proj@@ ector settings . each project type has different possible settings : most of them are described above the What is that ? -@@ help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
&quot; this entry appears only in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful when you need files from a previous session to import the current project . this is useful for you , even if this function is not used , so that you can see the files already existing files and folder . &quot;
&quot; this entry appears only in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function allows us to remove files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this feature remo@@ ves any files from the medium , they bl@@ ends only the previously imported files back . &quot;
&quot; opens the CD copying dialog . this also allows without project file to create a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also want to burn just an image of a CD which then you can then burn sooner or if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; opens the DVD copying dialog . this also allows without project file to create a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only get an image of a DVD with the help of copying . in addition , the target medium must be large enough to start the entire ( video ) data of the source medi@@ ums in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ R@@ W . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ R@@ W .
&quot; opens the dialog to form a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which makes the content completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the ty@@ mod@@ i over@@ write and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; bur@@ ns a previously er@@ stell@@ ated CD @-@ picture . the dialog ask for a * .@@ iso , * .c@@ ue or * .@@ to@@ c files are currently not supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not yet supported , you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; bur@@ ns a previously er@@ oom DVD @-@ picture . the dialog asks you a * .@@ iso -@@ file as a source of data , which can then immediately be burned through pressures of the burning button . &quot;
&quot; a previously managed DVD video can be converted . this dialogue window appears usually after reading a DVD in the content , but can also be used everywhere . it contains information about the illuminated video , codi@@ fication settings and even ways to change the size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the above medium . this information is represented in the contents and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of tool@@ boxes of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is crossed , a little tank is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; folder the folder view , or out . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content is enabled , its content is displayed in the contents . CD / DVD drives , also have a context menu with features such as media information , locks and locking of the drives or execution of the medium . &quot;
&quot; switch the ingredients to be or out . the contents allows to select and drag files into the project view . the view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the Cou@@ pled in the project view is a narro@@ wer area , which is only visible when the project view has open projects . the p@@ ei@@ ste has no real function , it just looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this will open a dialogue window to change the keyboard orders for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after having selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keyboard order further down . &quot;
&quot; this will start the K@@ 3@@ b ; tool assist@@ ants . this allows you to set the correct permission to burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system managers need to be required , therefore , you must enter the password for the system holder ( root ) . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here &apos;s general programme can be made . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should function on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and stream@@ lining the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is how many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface equipped with the help of this interface allows parts of the functionality for example via a shell script .
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; use functions , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , therefore , is rather your taste and the type of your task key dar@@ ed which the included programs can give you . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we assume that you use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P to use the functions , you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following one : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , which have all &amp; k@@ de ; program common , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b , provides functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and further functions for generating new projects . &quot;
D@@ COP@@ ref creat@@ e@@ Data@@ Power Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref creat@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref creat@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void _ v@@ d ( ) void _ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a creat@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one can create a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project D@@ urch Use of this reference it is possible to change the project about K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which can only be applied to data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void creat@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name , Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) void add@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( K@@ URL : : list URLs , Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) void remo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) void set@@ re@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String ) . &quot;
&quot; for example , it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folder and add files to the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT creat@@ e@@ Fol@@ der foo d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT creat@@ e@@ Fol@@ der
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ read@@ out for &amp; k@@ de ; with it you can easily read audio CD ; s read and installed in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible depending on the en@@ coder which is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface from cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ data in W@@ AV files on hard disk ) and by many Ko@@ di@@ ers who are supported by using these W@@ AV files ( default com@@ pression ) by default . additional co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
&quot; first , the title of the &amp; CD will be read and stored in W@@ AV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and com@@ pressed ) ; and then &quot;
in a second step these W@@ AV files ( usually one per title ) com@@ pressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or other formats like the Lost FLA@@ C .
&quot; for the first step to read the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package . if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step we need to be installed ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ un@@ till ( for O@@ GG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ erer . all these programs are usually necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions available . however , if FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required . &quot;
&quot; which Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ect / File format shall be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to co@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and com@@ pression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying from protected audio CD ; s : as already said , use &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the firmware of the CD ; / DVD device for protection , it is not possible to handle a protected audio CD ; it is not possible to avoid the mechanisms of cop@@ ier protection . simply avoid the purchase of cop@@ ier @-@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while the installation needs to be done only once ( the dialog dialog , but can often be called up until a suitable configuration is found ) , after the daily handling of a &amp; CD ; this leads to the hard drive . this leads ( hopefully ) for understanding for the sl@@ ender approach of the user interface , which you can often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which Ko@@ di@@ erer programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB from the Internet , or can work completely without network , whereby everything is recorded manually . &quot;
&quot; this is just a brief list of the commands of the main window . on the side step by step , you will find further information on how this program is used as well as the screens@@ hot with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; starting the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ Data according to the installation of request in the registration card CD@@ DB . ( this can be locally produced or online , in the latter case the connection must first be made to the Internet . ) &quot;
will start reading and - if a en@@ coder has been configured in the Products map for furnis@@ hing settings - the coding .
&quot; opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder , allowing the selection to be read with another en@@ coder as the default option . it is noted that before the en@@ coder has been configured in the tab code settings in the interior dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already selected file to code is selected rather than a complete &amp; CD ; out and coded . &quot;
&quot; opens the tool dialog for the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protoc@@ ols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program@@ ing events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; completed ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main @-@ edge dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different cart@@ on cards ( like en@@ coder , for the setup of the end ) . here you need to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ di@@ erer and com@@ pression controls and helps you in choosing the right Ko@@ di@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if no audio @-@ information is to be lost , a lost audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the small com@@ pression and hardly available commercial instruments that can reproduce them . &quot;
&quot; under the audio formats , the information obtained through data com@@ presses depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG may have the most frequent advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences will produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will nevertheless be supplied with most distri@@ butions free , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high up to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ ders ) , but compared with O@@ GG , slightly deeper quality with deeper bit@@ ors . &quot;
og@@ g - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG instruments are available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB Stick , memory card , disk ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - initially 2009 - support these devices usually only the MP3 format . &quot;
a brief list of parameters for the audio quality and the pressing comp@@ pres@@ sive rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This attitude should usually offer to most people and most of the musical pieces of unacceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , com@@ pression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , com@@ pression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , com@@ pression rate approximately 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enjoyment for music of young people , portable devices and car stere@@ otypes . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stere@@ ograms . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information provided by manually or by the program automatically from the free@@ DB over the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . they can be delivered with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the codi@@ le program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with co@@ di@@ er@@ programs , there is often a combination of programs for the codi@@ fication and these parameters . the manual or help to co@@ di@@ ers declare the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the key@@ word ( English : day ) , when MP@@ 3@@ s are coded with l@@ ame , the switches must be added by l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks so : &apos; ... - tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button @-@ drawing in assist@@ ants ) :
&quot; this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which people can download the audio CD , so that all other these information can be downloaded instead of text : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I am not a lawyer . however , nobody can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; for more or less valuable , so any information cannot be added to the artist or CD ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is actively used to choose a cross @-@ box ( sending an address ) . for the use of free@@ DB can not be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address , but in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address may not be used when retri@@ eve the data from the server ( This is only the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for use of free@@ DB , the geo@@ graf@@ ic should be used on the next lying mirror server . this saves band@@ width on the network and resem@@ bles the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a list of mir@@ rors for the online call of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which read@@ out program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in W@@ AV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that this cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see for sure that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package has to be installed at first , if this has not yet happened . &quot;
&quot; for stor@@ ing the W@@ AV files , the codi@@ fication and thus the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening you are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a non@@ committ@@ ing for audio data ) on the tab for the setup of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . other co@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the codi@@ fication can be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined co@@ di@@ erer . for more information on co@@ di@@ erer are in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; after installing a Ko@@ di@@ ers , further information on his switch can be obtained through the input of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a consoles window ( eg ; con@@ sole ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed co@@ di@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this may have many causes . check out the device drawing of the &amp; CD ; / DVD disk , the des@@ ider@@ y and readers of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) . try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give a reference to what is wrong . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a cop@@ ier audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , these tips can give you how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , all understood , but are somehow still uns@@ afe what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example we will launch the program for the first time , setup everything and our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ word ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . in any case , it is not necessary to compile the source files , what you can of course do . &quot;
please make sure that directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have to be writing ( eg ; by trying to copy something to the con@@ quer@@ or something ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something which is probably done only once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes how to proceed to a &amp; CD , which needs to be repeated for every print@@ out &amp; CD ; to be repeated . &quot;
&quot; here we determine the appropriate co@@ di@@ erer to com@@ pression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . because we are lazy , we split the program to use the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change it in any way of reading a &amp; CD ; change when once the matching settings are found . &quot;
the device drawing is handed over to the read@@ out program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device drawing of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the effective equipment page can also be accessed using existing entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the card @-@ card universal settings . here you can &apos;t do much to do . here , an additional transformation can be defined . in our example , everything will be shown as in the screens@@ hot . &quot;
&quot; only with un@@ complete information can be asked , so that you will be informed if data are missing from the key@@ word ( tags ) . &quot;
the card card CD ; -@@ settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; CD ; data automatically can be downloaded over the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
&quot; note : the machine must be connected to the computer during the reading of the &amp; CD , so that it can access the free@@ DB server . &quot;
&quot; the second drop @-@ field is easier , will be found a &amp; CD ; entry is immediately linked with the database entry and the fil@@ en@@ ame directory / fil@@ en@@ ame or fil@@ en@@ ame , they can easily change . the fil@@ es@@ - or fil@@ en@@ ame will be changed , and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example is to be observed : if you want to use everything manually , so check the selection fields and free@@ DB will not use it . however , this is about 620 MB large , consider these two choices to be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map ticket . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eve the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server on the Internet . how do you know the system , what data the CD is to get ? read the section about free@@ DB . put it in the screens@@ hot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org page and look for a mirror server in your area . on this road , the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as a first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both function syn@@ onymous with the server , since many fire@@ walls log into the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually open to surf the internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to submit a CD @-@ CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . the first crossing @-@ box should be dis@@ abling .
simply take the settings of the screens@@ hot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneously inter@@ rup@@ tive pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? &quot; Parall@@ el@@ es Read and Ko@@ de ? the author knows it not , therefore simply try yourself . &quot;
CD ; after reading the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you go to this folder , then the files can be stored / Fol@@ der . this can &apos;t be useful if only place on another drive . do not forget the files in the private folder . do not forget that folder if you want to do something with the W@@ AV files . &quot;
&quot; to enter everything as it is on the screens@@ hot . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances something must be left to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned earlier , this is an adjustment for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo systems . the com@@ pression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &quot; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of generating tags on Version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags may also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; day for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screens@@ hot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
&quot; at the same time , W@@ AV files : with a du@@ al@@ Core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be temp@@ ted to function more than a W@@ AV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is what we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as standard for any reading a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section described , how the process of read@@ out the &amp; CD ; we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , which is structured in the previous section , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB will be described , must be repeated for each read@@ able &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; since we have one &amp; CD ; use which is not yet included in free@@ DB , the screens@@ hot is a little different than those for a &amp; CD ; with successfully from free@@ DB de@@ for@@ ested data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually copy them out of the internet . comments are point to the differences . &quot;
try not the &amp; CD ; this example is to find . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet done , then the &amp; CD has to be defined in the main window , which has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and its length should be listed in the window , as in the screens@@ hot . this only if the &amp; CD is identified ; as audio CD , and can be read from cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen , then search in section questions and answers about the help or go back to the previous section concerning the settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD was able to be picked up by the free@@ DB , all tracks of the pieces are already filled and also the name of the artist and album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; for the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window appears , and you can select the database item that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; if you do not have the cross field for the automatic query of the free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialogue for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , you need the access to the internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen . the title of the piece in the first line of the item &apos;s Cur@@ l title &apos; containing the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
&quot; the artist must no longer be entered into the input field &apos; Updated title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for the single comments ini@@ di@@ api@@ ell per unit , the comment field of the album will be used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the free@@ DB is not empty , but it contains already a good idea to verify the content of the CD Edit@@ ors . however , it &apos;s always a good idea to start the content of the CD Edit@@ ors ( e.g. if all words with upper@@ case letters , or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limited the length of fields to 30 characters for the artist , album , and titles of a piece and to only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . this option is set up on the &apos; File &apos; tab &apos; tab . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files later on with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all Ko@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see the help to the co@@ di@@ erer in order to get more information .
&quot; simply select an entry that is obvious with the style of the read@@ able CD ; this is not important since we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; data anyway , go to the Internet page of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example can be found under Rock . &quot;
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD Edit@@ ors will be back and you see that the fields for the album have already been filled with the entered data that we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the item in any case and other information you wish .
click the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have all the title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third kno@@ b of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the piece list .
&quot; note that there is a check @-@ character in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked are selected . make sure all the pieces are selected , or edit the button All pieces select at the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces at one time . &quot;
&quot; was launched by clicking on the button of selecting the read@@ out process , so this window appears to confirm . OK , then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab orders for switching on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
this error message you will see if you are trying to work with a co@@ di@@ erer you have not yet installed . pieces which were not successful with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the tmp @-@ file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in example . have checked whether you write to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now it is clear , why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . so please read and conclude parallel . consider the status registration in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has not found configur@@ ations to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only one thing is configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and ex@@ code . in powerful machines , the results used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 appears to have no problem during simultaneous reading and ex@@ code ( from however two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title will be read , while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queue of the co@@ di@@ ers . after the last piece is coded , a small window will end with a message for a short while in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . respectively 4.@@ x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create com@@ pressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the codi@@ fication of your choice . &quot;
&quot; available today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S already chat with CV@@ S , you can download from there an anonymous copy . the majority of distri@@ butions are already a pre @-@ compiled package of your distribution . if you read this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is addressed to individuals who compile the source files , and not for users to use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for assistance like the program can be customized when it runs , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls for many different other programs , has many variations of settings . the best way to get to know the options and settings . it displays displays the different cart@@ on maps of settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still am reading ? even if only the help menu after the first time it was cli@@ cked , without any cl@@ ue as it should proceed from this somehow empty screen ( especially when there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; what is it ? who reads this , has probably already started the program . it should look like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately not any e @-@ mail . the author can not sustain this manual . it is intended as a first version for a manual for &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; if you always want to add something useful or change it . at least , after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he added this section and is therefore agreed with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange if you have managed to pick up the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N to pick up , then you do not need these information , but ... &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ ass of &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others he has not have a real @-@ time sti@@ cker and kar@@ a@@ oke @-@ real @-@ character set of texts as well as some properties that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI @-@ players do not have .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , thus support the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver , which is needed for the CIS . AL@@ SA is included as soon as there is a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; c@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;

supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or textures files ) . K@@ Mid will automatically determine the procedure used .
seat support . if you have &amp; k@@ de ; finish during a song of a song , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song again . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI @-@ Syn@@ thesizer , A@@ we , FM and CIS -@@ maps ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the menu item . it appears the usual file dialog , with whose help you choose the desired song . &quot;
you can also let a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window fall . this also works with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and bet@@ s the button Select in the tool@@ bar , select the entry section from the menu item or bet@@ ate the Spac@@ eb@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will start automatically , once you go to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces , they are added to a collection and then re@@ played each other . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece of play , you can jump at any point by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the templates . to re @-@ click the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the Spac@@ eb@@ ar has two tasks : when a piece is dis@@ played , a pressure on the button break , like a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry in the menu piece , thus breaks the play@@ back while no piece is de@@ played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the play@@ back . &quot;
lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text event event and other both . some pieces have no text at all : - )
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what events are to be presented and even better : the event type is automatically selected , so you have to set the entry Autom@@ atic text selection automatically . however , you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to adjust to an event type , select from the menu settings the entries text event or song events . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summar@@ ize . these are shown the line after you . in this section you can use the collections efficiently .
&quot; to collect a collection , first open the collection manufacturer . find this in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ise .... Click there on New and give the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then enter the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the gaps in collecting camps . &quot;
the temporary collection leads all songs that you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when using the application , this collection will not be saved . concern that if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in collecting camps . there you can add a song using the button to add a song . in turn , the file dialog , with whose help you can choose the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the adjustment of automation on the collection .
&quot; when automation add to the collection is enabled , a piece of opening ( using file Open or D@@ rag &amp; Drop ) is automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; if Autom@@ atic Add to the collection is not activated , opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and activated . this collection will then continue to be added . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection bearings , select the collection and the desired song and then click Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you select the row after the sub @-@ menu collection of the menu , the songs are played in the order , as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to add a song , select it in collectors &quot; or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump to one song , select the button of next song , set the next song from the menu piece , or push the button arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to reverse the song back , select the kno@@ b upward piece , the listing of forecasts from the menu piece or push the button arrow left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection , select the collection , and click the button Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection can not be deleted . however , it doesn &apos;t matter as it is not saved at the release of &amp; k@@ mid ; it is not saved . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI @-@ events occur in events that understands the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that changes all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and therefore always a trumpet ring when originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you do not need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and CIS -@@ maps , FM @-@ devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ maps . so you have to edit the appropriate file of hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file that saves all necessary re@@ aliz@@ ations for the play of a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . the requirement for this is , however , that every appearance has a different text id ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further key@@ map ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
&quot; you see that De@@ fine is needed , to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is reached . &quot;
please send me your Map @-@ File as an e @-@ mail so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support may be compatible with devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section is stated as the patches of general MIDI of your specific keyboard can be formed . the general use is as follows :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equation can be ignored . it is assumed that the GM -@@ patches are in the right sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the op@@ tion@@ ale All Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to place all sounds , which support this tool for example ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) that is similar to a gun . do you wear the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( Win ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here is the term Tro@@ uble @-@ patch of the patch , in which every sound is a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ al stru@@ ment ( drum , pel@@ vis , Marac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the tone means the tone height of the always the same drum ( as it did some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to indicate how notes on a specific channel or instrument can be pic@@ tured .
&quot; as with P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P &apos;s section , the order of the lines is very important , as well as its availability . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define for each channel and each instrument multiple key@@ maps . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to form tones on the per@@ ch channel . take a look at the suitable key@@ chain .
&quot; this section can be used to form some channels to others . if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel , you simply make it in the CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the perc@@ ussion on a specific channel ( general MIDI channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi @-@ De@@ vices need 16 channels , the CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered between 0 and 15 , built according to the following patterns : &quot;
&quot; N is the channel , which is used on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will need to use the name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will be ignored on this channel . in this case , the patch will be used at this canal . &quot;
the option For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful for example to always use the per@@ ch patch on the per@@ ch channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ rati@@ o indicates , in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events can be multip@@ lied with the value n , this with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) is calculated and then only passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file is not dec@@ im@@ al@@ kom@@ mas ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting will be used because GM will give you a keyboard , which is a pitch @-@ b@@ ending event with the value 40@@ 96 , to play a tone higher . unfortunately , however , try some key@@ boards to play two notes up to an oc@@ tave higher . to try the right value on your keyboard , you must try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
to use a MIDI @-@ map just open the dialog MIDI settings . you can find in the menu under settings , point MIDI @-@ settings &quot;
the can@@ al@@ view is a window with a whole bunch of pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ anos you see which sounds just played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you have changed a tool . if you have changed a tool , the button lights no longer green but red , to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the can@@ al@@ view has ( until now ) two different views available to view the sounds . the view will choose settings under the Point Kan@@ al@@ view : settings
&quot; the speed @-@ LCD shows the speed in which a song will be played , the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , and etc . . this allows the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; good , I can force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file 4 MB needs ( a com@@ pres@@ sive relationship of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed and etc . you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have compiled a binary distribution ( r@@ pm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we support you need to download a source distribution and install ( for example by k@@ mid ; &quot; s Home ) &quot;
&quot; I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree to support &amp; k@@ mid ; D@@ rag &amp; Drop . open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
enable prior to advance the setting of automatic execution to the collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can taste the arrow buttons on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD screen to slow back the standard temp@@ o . to double the default temp@@ o you can double on the LCD monitor .
&quot; I have on one &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ work@@ space a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ a window with my MIDI @-@ folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this way , I have to shoot a file or play ( if I want to play a file format ) or if I want to play a file , just to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; move the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; if you want to listen to a file fast without putting them into a collection , turn off the setting of automatic execution to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection addition to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take you , you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . access only once you want to play the first file . so make sure you select the setting of automatic execution to the collection and open A.@@ Midland . your temporary collection contains then exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
then un@@ lock you to create B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid players and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . all thank you ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ate me , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ isons ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) , but I try to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect a bit of time . as hob@@ bies I collect programming , MIDI files , music make and sets . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where they can download MIDI / Kar@@ a@@ oke files , if you want a question or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
you really make me feel a great pleasure if you send me a postcard from your place or a MID@@ I@@ - / Kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . all who want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file ; if you want to send me a MIDI files then I would like to contact me as I may have the file already .
I &apos;ve been written &amp; k@@ mid ; totally in my spare time and by anyone spending money for money . I would like to emphasize that I am only to program@@ m@@ able because / if I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wai and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Beh@@ a@@ unch of the bug that the ton@@ ality at A@@ we cards was too high .

&quot; in addition to this can be found &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which is found at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ pink / k@@ mid@@ .html . you can also find links to pages with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc . &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound@@ card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends much on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same if you use a FM @-@ device or a map@@ we card .
if you do not have sound card you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you would like to hear a sound card except that you can &apos;t hear music .
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; none ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; p @-@ player , is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is needed to play video files from the M@@ Player or PH@@ ON@@ ON formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet termin@@ ated as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional assistance , please check the site The KDE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optional , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is a information window that will only be displayed when information is displayed in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to absor@@ b the preferred connections among the book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , you should be played by one another , so you should use the category of thum@@ bs playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy level . if you have a entry stage , his group and all its sub @-@ groups to the current category copies and the play@@ back starts with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and thum@@ bs playlist may also be changed by direct injection of the XML configur@@ ations . of course , one can only do if &amp; km@@ player . of course , you can only do if &amp; features / apps / features , but also by application yourself . simply by clicking on one sub@@ group , only the XML contents of this section is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you need to be chosen from the menu item down@@ side with play@@ back and either selected by the edit mode , or another category selected . &quot;
all changes will be lost when the Edit@@ ing mode will leave or another group selected without having to eliminate the playlist .
&quot; due to the convenience of the author of &amp; km@@ player , some features can only be switched from changing the XML configur@@ ations . &quot;
the animation at the starting and loading can be disabled by the den@@ ting of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c and Change of &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; km@@ player ; will notice the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / features / apps / pack@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be an supported XML file .
&quot; the animation at the start does not need to be short , it will automatically end through the opening of another source . this would be dis@@ rup@@ tive to the end of animation , the user can end the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start animation can be the adver@@ ts of a favorite pictures : &amp; lt ; body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; In source package of &amp; km@@ player ; are included in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L the by &amp; km@@ player .
there is a rider on the configuration of M@@ Player in the configur@@ ations dialog of &amp; km@@ player ; here the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the sub @-@ memory size of the network and other things .
another tool for error search is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of km@@ player . here the output of m@@ player is visible .
there is no rider for this playlist in the configuration dialog of &amp; km@@ player ; everything must be configured by manu@@ als of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ gu@@ c . here is an example of a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&quot; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; km@@ ar ; it can even be inserted the special field Em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; there@@ with the &amp; km@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can be re@@ played , the &amp; km@@ player ; module as service provider for the m@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the interior dialog file aler@@ ts from KDE . &quot;
&quot; cross @-@ section or &amp; km@@ player ; is available in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding loading of the browser module library . the gest@@ ed process is p@@ p@@ player . if there are no mistakes , the back@@ end output inside &amp; km@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; thus , a pre@@ conceived back@@ end for a certain m@@ ime type is taken ( of course only when this has been determined ) , this must be done by manu@@ als of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example PH@@ ON@@ ON must add all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ player , can be installed by TV cards either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before television can be configured , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; for configuration of the V@@ DR ( Video data Rek@@ order ) settings in km@@ player , the dialog will be found in the settings - &gt; source - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there should be ports to be found ( e.g. , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B included in it . &quot;
since the V@@ DR support of km@@ player can only use X@@ video ( probably this type of play@@ fully supported by video devices under Linux the only works ) . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension must be available for the X server ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
&quot; internally used by KM@@ Player for the sources different names . at the time of emergence of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ al source , source source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ anners , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they begin with the play@@ back of the playlist . &quot;
is there references how to make my CD@@ ROM drive fre@@ iser if I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to perform as user root after saving the device . it is absolutely sure to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom is shown on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;

Q@@ t : : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + to create graphical user interface and network support and becomes a comp@@ iling of &amp; k@@ ile .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional computer application . under Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be accessed by the package &amp; tex@@ ex ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components may be included in the use &amp; Linux ; distribution should be included . for installation the distribution of distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be attracted .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the k@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation is taken into account . however , the support for this project or its documentation is required , the contact to the k@@ ile should be made . &quot;
&quot; if you have questions about or when comp@@ iling from &amp; k@@ ile ; to or become extensions , this should be addressed on the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ environment for the use of all &amp; lat@@ ex ; features in a graphical user interface and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made tools for this . finally , the opportunity to complete , comp@@ iling , and trou@@ bles@@ tools for this . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and its possibilities to learn should be attracted to Kate &apos;s manual . users of &amp; k@@ ile are able to go directly to the reading of the chapter with the editor of &amp; Kate .

&quot; in addition , only a good sol@@ dering view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given it is not the ultimate book to help me . B. H. Cop@@ ka / P. W. Dal@@ y , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ fi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; just like other significant languages include &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction to be specified with the general characteristics like paper format , side num@@ b@@ ade and text color , the King &apos;s command begins with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { document } . &quot;
the fast entry level of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a single feature for the fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of assist@@ ants ( menu ) provides some possibilities for creating the document . it can also be made some of the document related settings .
&quot; document classes : this is hereby depic@@ ted the type of the document : article ( article ) , book &#91; logo &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , Pro@@ sp@@ ector &#91; Be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined . &quot;

new users are now not worried either . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information can be discussed in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - as well as other source editors - the re@@ perc@@ ussions of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) is likely to have noticed that some mathematical area is not closed . however , it will save you through the modest appearance of output and time . &quot;
&quot; with automatic verification of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ Beg@@ in { Command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates a whit@@ er ( for input of text ) and the per@@ tin@@ ent line to the code } . this function can be disabled ... La@@ TeX commands may be disabled . &quot;
&quot; all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; ex@@ Ã ¶ h@@ eight@@ ed the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most common and subtle element ) : &quot;
&quot; in view of the document in the structural view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by one mouse click on the respective button . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful in creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful , navig@@ ating &amp; k@@ ile ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer on the respective line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI @-@ file contained a description of the format document and also other information like the font and also other information such as font ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools to view , conversion and printing of DVI ; files for different systems and bars . &quot;
&quot; when using the solution @-@ search function , the elements of DVI ; -@@ file is cli@@ cked with the editor and as soon as one element in the DVI ; source code was cli@@ cked , the exact opposite is on it . once upon a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was cli@@ cked , the corresponding location in the DVI . &quot;
Master @-@ document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document the work is simplified to work with other ab@@ .@@ tex files . when using a project a project project can be set to project settings .
quick @-@ construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in source code ) .
file review : in this mode the DVI ; -@@ file is available on its dosage and it is not a call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the rapid construction .
&quot; when exam@@ ining the mach@@ ining tool@@ bar the three gro@@ oves should be stri@@ pped to the document . the selection fields have been developed for the rapid break@@ down of the document in parts , chapter , sections , ... the ver@@ able &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the selection field is for example of articles such as keywords , notes , notes or references . the options are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name for a section , an image or different element is created . &quot;
cover : is used to add a reference to a fixed name ( select a selection ) .
&quot; the author &apos;s quot@@ ation is shown a selection list with liter@@ ary entries . at &amp; b@@ b@@ tex ; these files are appropriate editors necessary . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; c@@ bi@@ tex ; the author can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last drop @-@ field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã s will be used for defining the font , and can be set the font , for the main text , the notes , notes etc . and there are the following font , as follows : &quot;
&quot; in the call of &amp; k@@ ile , there are two choices for creating a new document by selecting the document and determines the settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason to hand . &quot;
&quot; the brack@@ ets after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; places the font . if the font is not at the beginning , this can also happen also in the text . &quot;
once the above @-@ code example has to be compiled the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code will be compiled . the easiest way to achieve this is the use of men@@ Ã ¼ s or of the button @-@ making super@@ structure .
the code @-@ text needs to be saved from the comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; add the storage automatically .
&quot; the comp@@ iling of the document error , should be sought in the protocol according to errors . when using quick@@ set should &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started . if this is not the case , the protocol should also be considered . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( engl@@ er environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font , is 12 created and only a few words , the command \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ \ &quot; environment } &quot;
any restrictions are only within the environment ( from \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } to \ \ &apos; { environment } ) . there is no compl@@ ementary ( number ) for setting up in an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and usability of the document . you can , for example , certain fonts , fat pressure , short @-@ pressure , under@@ coat , etc . these commands may end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ Beg@@ in { emp@@ h } : this command is for the spa pressure and is long as long as it is closed with a \ \ \ { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ ratio : created a quot@@ ation in the document . the quote begins with \ \ Beg@@ in { ratio } and ends with \ \ end } .
&quot; after writing the source of the source with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; indic@@ ative language is shown , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; once in assist@@ ants a bit text was entered , some adjustments should be accomplished for better read@@ ability of the document . therefore , a quote , a few places in fat and cur@@ ves and a poem to the application are coming to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , the editor or Str@@ g E can be returned to the editor ( in internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , its windows must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script file ; / PDF file will be converted . &quot;
DVI ; is a framed file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ unk ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi issue such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ converting or computer imaging . &quot;
&quot; for the print of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for generating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can be printed ( if the printer is correct ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar , the conversion of DVI ; -@@ file into other formats . once the DVI ; -@@ file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code has been created , the transformation is to start into the tool@@ bar in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the preliminary search function exc@@ el the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ binary files . this must only create Modern under settings k@@ ile ... tools B@@ auen .
&quot; to check the pre @-@ search search , the mouse @-@ po@@ inter is positioned in a line of the source , and then slept on pre @-@ looking search results . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI . spect@@ ator takes place . &quot;
with this function in &amp; Oc@@ ular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the appropriate &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; k@@ ile ; set up and for the respective line . this must be set in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ( settings ey@@ epi@@ ece ... editor )
&quot; if the use of quick @-@ construction of the &amp; DVI ; viewers do not apply a bug , this should be a bug , it will appear in the log file or in the message window in summary . &quot;
&quot; the log file is the error source in the source code . in the editor there is always the line , in which the error appears . to view the faul@@ ty fl@@ ags and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ TeX errors and kid@@ ding errors , it must be cli@@ cked on the error in the protocol and &amp; k@@ ile ; jump to faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; once upon the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose the selected template for the document . &quot;
&quot; when selecting the empty document , a document can be used either from scratch or the wiz@@ ard to the fast creation of a new document . further information can be used in the section . &quot;
&quot; feature user of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents . Tem@@ plates can be saved in &amp; k@@ ile , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either create an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; -@@ file per@@ ched or create a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and select file templates . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using the new document , some strings have to be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or string coding ) . these variables can set up in Settings K@@ ile ... settings general . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
&quot; $ $ DO@@ T@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string will be used by entering into the class . typically , it will be used : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ T@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } . &quot;
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard and the constitu@@ ents of the commands shown in the editor . once the document has been created in this way the following steps was accomplished :
&quot; when creating a new document , the own template cannot be rated instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any of lat@@ ex ; files , a simple way to create a template , should be sought after a template and the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; c@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and sl@@ ings of many different types of text files ( including also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be carried out in the menu tools directly from &amp; k@@ ile .
to learn more about Kate &apos;s Eve ; and his features should be attracted to Kate &apos;s manual . users of &amp; k@@ ile should go directly to the reading of the chapter with the editor of &amp; Kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands reference to be called the men@@ Ã ¼ by La@@ TeX Refer@@ ences . you can find a detailed description of virtually all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syn@@ tax .
&quot; a double @-@ clicking with penet@@ rated Str@@ g button to create the &amp; tex ; -@@ Word means that in this way , clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par added . &quot;
&quot; when pul@@ ling the text with penet@@ rated lin@@ ker , the full text will automatically be copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
when using the arrow buttons with penet@@ rated re@@ turn@@ able taste can be used parts of the source file in the editing window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the possibilities to search the most diverse types of source tex@@ tiles and to raise them . for example the &amp; lat@@ ex are different from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by a different color .
&quot; many assist@@ ants may choose any spr@@ ing@@ ed spr@@ ing@@ marks inside the text . these are also highlighted the jump to n@@ Ã ¤ n@@ sten or the corresponding key@@ ing stamp . this is also highlighted the jump @-@ brand , so that it is automatically exp@@ elled during the first entry of a character . &quot;
&quot; the Edit is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; already excellent features , important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands provided for their selection . under Edit panels , the following commands are included in the selection selection : &quot;
&quot; above all , a complete paragraph ( group of lines , included on both sides a blank lines ) . this advanced importance was not targeted with tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all the other lines of the source . the only bow thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is so that the waste has been separated by two empty lines . &quot;
&quot; select the word under the current C@@ urs@@ or@@ position . this selection has also an extended meaning , as this command also has &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a return @-@ line ( \ \ ) and an extra star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
to the spo@@ on of a part of the document can be removed naturally and by pressing the button Ent@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers its own instruction for a faster result . under mach@@ ining removal are the following commands to cover the text :
remo@@ ves a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description of mach@@ ining he@@ als .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for further commands below mach@@ ining environment for a m@@ Ã ¶ le simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ;
this command will be donated to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly in front of the command to the comfort of the area .
this command is donated to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the command to the fl@@ ap of the area .
&quot; if the c@@ ursor before or within the command \ \ Beg@@ in { near } is , becomes the end of the surrounding area ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many wel@@ ded environmentally command@@ ing commands may be lost quickly of the time looking back . this command adm@@ its the most recent environment , so that the wast@@ ed environment structure is not destroy . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers also special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups that are determined by brack@@ ets { ... } . under Edit@@ ing TeX groups are a few important commands to suit those from mach@@ ining environment .
this command will lead to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly in front of the pe@@ eled brack@@ et .
this command will disp@@ ense with this command to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the pe@@ eled brack@@ et .
&quot; when the c@@ ursor before or behind the s@@ ly shar@@ k cl@@ amps , a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is , becomes the other end of the group p@@ pr@@ isons ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many scre@@ ened groups @-@ brack@@ ets can be lost quickly of the Ã Ã ¶ ber groups . this command adm@@ its the most recent group , so that the sp@@ ined structure of &amp; tex ; -@@ groups do not destroy . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; are used two simple terms of conversion . for the purpose of purpose , the sign is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; for two simple explanations is used . &quot;
this automatic filing of the double file plates can set up under Settings K@@ ile ... La@@ TeX em@@ bed and det@@ ained .
&quot; you can also use L@@ Ã ¤ n@@ der@@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) , and thus German or fran@@ z@@ Ã ¶ h@@ can be used . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; in the wir@@ ing of Shift ; input holes &amp; k@@ ile ; an intelligent for@@ bid . in case , the current position within a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or item@@ ize ) is for example &amp; k@@ ile ; not only a for@@ bid but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; inside a tables , connect &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ , with an end @-@ end for@@ ef@@ ish outbreak . &quot;
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments to support them .
&quot; some users enjoy the columns in tables and in doing all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . if this tab@@ ulator is seeking &amp; k@@ ile ; according to the most common tab@@ ulator is not the per@@ tin@@ ent , for the columns of the current tab . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; Kate ; already has a good source text comprehen@@ sion , it was built in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special orders ( usually for example &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) are still enhanced . there are three different modes of working for different ways of working under settings for all these modes . &quot;
at the start a new environment using the command \ \ Beg@@ in { surrounding } is &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically the command \ \ end { surrounding } after an empty row ( for the text ) added .
&quot; when pressing the wall taste , the last character of the input will be removed and you can fill out the complete list . on the other hand , the list by entering a further letter can also be smaller . &quot;
&quot; all commands will be written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are fil@@ tr@@ ated by selecting a command . alternatively , spr@@ ing@@ ags can also be folded , so that a simple jump to these positions by using the jumping mat n@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ est spr@@ ink@@ able parameters can then be folded . &quot;
under settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; complete settings may be made available to these lists . there may be various types of choice for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as che@@ eses of general language used .
&quot; the command mode is for the util@@ isation of environments not n@@ Ã ¼ lich . however , it is always used a few letters with \ \ Beg@@ in and the call of the complete mode of environment . on the other hand , the environments will often be used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the understanding of the environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the complete mode of comprehen@@ sion mode , the men@@ Ã ¼ rich environment or the ke@@ yst@@ eine Alt + Shift key leaves the command to the comfort of the environment , and it appears \ \ Beg@@ in { . afterwards , the environment can be continued in the simpl@@ est way and by pressing the input button . &quot;
&quot; after all this is accomplished , the environment will be automatically closed . as soon as &amp; k@@ ile ; realize that it is a lists environment , is even a first \ \ item command with one . &quot;
&quot; under settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; complete settings may be made available to these lists . this mode uses the code list of the complete mode of comprehen@@ sion mode , and lat@@ ex ; commands . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; supported user @-@ defined lists of ab@@ uses which can immediately set up under settings k@@ ile . the lists can be set up under settings k@@ ile ... for example a query list is the file exam@@ ple@@ .c@@ wl , in which example the entry L = \ \ La@@ TeX is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L entered and the word pre@@ determined mode for men@@ dic@@ ate ste@@ ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ TeX . &quot;
&quot; gro@@ ove is not helpful for automatic understanding , however , has been found that many rules in a document are written more than once . thus , &amp; k@@ ile ; the comprehen@@ sion for all already written walls . &quot;
&quot; this mode can set up in the men@@ ue Settings ... K@@ ile Ver@@ fully @-@ not@@ ables . here , the swelling can also be determined for the display of comprehen@@ sion . &quot;
the surv@@ ey@@ ing files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / tile / mode / of the Persian Home folder / mode ( nam@@ ing ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ R@@ ear@@ book ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialog &apos;s graphics include the form of graphics as simple as possible . establishing the bases to the graphics formats , the sections should be and desp@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for setting up and re@@ orders from pages . if the PDF files can be used with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools newly arranged and then be converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to be able to set the results of work , you need to compile the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the menu , creating comp@@ iling , creating and creating view . &quot;
&quot; for the comp@@ iling of the source of source as well as ey@@ epi@@ ece . or the further conversion can be used in default ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; -@@ file is converted into a PS file and by means of Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
when using the command quick@@ set is normally called a viewer after the comp@@ iling . should not be used in secondary viewers a new window will turn into a new window .
a new project will be asked for the project to project .... here the following information is en@@ qu@@ eri@@ ed for the project :
&quot; when downloading the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the script of EC@@ MA@@ Script -@@ Ko@@ de . the scripts can be managed in the sen@@ k@@ right cor@@ ste .
API @-@ scripts are not yet developed and can be found in further versions of &amp; k@@ ile .
the first one has to be said that the development environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) with the following methods :
&quot; lat@@ ex ; is a very distinct system , where the basic functionality could be expanded through a variety of options available to support users . &quot;
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are delivered with many documents . they contain a documentation for the included packages and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; it is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather , is a complete instruction manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; steps are included and is therefore ideal for searching for a certain form@@ atting . since it is a very gro@@ ove document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; ship , finding the right document is not always easy . as a single help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contained a database with all too &amp; k@@ ile ; supplied documents and detailed documents . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the size of the space is the search for par@@ cel name or p@@ ile . by &amp; k@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .
a double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the beta @-@ fl@@ ags of the leads the viewer for the document .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; -@@ source editor that can be trac@@ ed on all systems with installed &amp; cold ; - and Unix flavor ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X installed .
many thanks to those who continue after the pers@@ ist of the &amp; k@@ ile ; project strive and d@@ af@@ fled many hours for the development of tools we can use all under consideration of &amp; GNU ; -@@ license can be used in men@@ Ã ¼ fers &amp; k@@ ile .

&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result should be named , and the file is usually stored in her hom@@ est@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lo@@ os ; they may have little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not wait until someone can use the gun powder into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lo@@ os . you can use the plug @-@ ins in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements elements can be used . read more about it below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a K@@ Part , we start using the plug @-@ ins plugins . this is the following dialogue : &quot;
&quot; this dialog allows to manage all the plugins and add new plug @-@ ins . we describe each &amp; GUI , element in it : &quot;
here you can enter the search box . when adding plugins without a memory location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to the Sear@@ ching of the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the listing of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project properties are configured .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nickname is the nickname of the user and serves for clear identification .
&quot; a member can have several roles in the project , such as team@@ leader as well as sub@@ project leader . &quot;
&quot; the user can look out from the list of the team members , who he is . this happens when pressing the team member from the list and the button appears as oppressed . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears f@@ ett after which you are : text . &quot;
&quot; nickname and adjustment of their own identity are important in terms of messages and comments , see for further information about notes . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by gathering of the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team manager if something is done specific . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that will be executed when something specific in the project happens . an example would be presenting the opening of the opening and closing of the project , so much somebody will be saved , or the sending of a message when a file is saved , or a script that one file is added to CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project , etc . &quot;
&quot; on the site &apos;s configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project settings , events can be created , processed and deleted . &quot;
an em@@ ail@@ ment will be sent to the addres@@ see in the receiver -@@ list selected addres@@ see . the addres@@ see may be a team@@ - or sub@@ project leader . see where such lad@@ ders will be established .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
to enter notes is simple . it can either choose the note entry from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary box followed by an@@ tigen text .
&quot; remarks you can be sent a determin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syn@@ tax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , whereby the nickname of the project manager of the team leaders should be stated in the following ways : team leaders , as well as sub@@ project names , as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; names and roller names are independent of large or small , but spaces around the brack@@ ets and the : make the note invali@@ d . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ ative languages that DT@@ D @-@ tuned is and web@@ based form@@ ative and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
the settings are accessible via the settings menu . here are only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings treat , a short description for the others can be found . &quot;
the settings can be set up by means of Settings Qu@@ anta . diesel @-@ dialog extends over a few pages that will be addressed to each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car full @-@ standing can be modified with it . the entries are :
&quot; large / small @-@ announcement of tags : large / small @-@ shipment of automatically extrac@@ ted tags . normal Groß / Klein@@ fl@@ ector means , the tags are added as inserted in the tag@@ onal files . &quot;
&quot; large / low @-@ shipment of attributes : large / low @-@ shipment of automatically generated attributes . normal Groß / Klein@@ fl@@ ector means , the attributes are inserted as inserted in the tag@@ onal files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically close : if it is stopped , for tags , for the final day op@@ tionally , this is immediately following the &amp; gt ; added . &quot;
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags except for the simple tags .
&quot; starting and final day automatically update : when switched , the appropriate day will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic detection of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the appropriate coding during the ti@@ pping .
M@@ IME types : Mim@@ eti@@ es to the detection of different types of files . using the standard re@@ plac@@ ements the standard gave to be recovered .
default text coding : the coding of newly created or used in other ways than with file Open @-@ opening files ( where the coding of the file can be over@@ looked ) . this attitude here is loaded from the same in the project Properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the chosen DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D cannot be recognized . this attitude here is loaded from the same in the project Properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regularly backup copies , so that with a black@@ out or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . that &apos;s not the same as the saving of the file . it is not the same as the saving of the file . it is not saved regularly , according to the time provided . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editors or in a separate view ( or the documentation in a cardboard box ) , which makes it possible to look at the documentation , preview and source code simultaneously . &quot;
replace the window settings on the Standard back next to the next start is useful when the user interface came through to change the M@@ DI @-@ Mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command parameters .
warning messages also serves the taxes of the possibility to dis@@ able the display of war@@ nings by calling for no more inquiries .
&quot; the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ ization behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in shared mode . in terms of the different modes . &quot;
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the struc@@ tor , which represents the figure of the Par@@ ser @-@ node in the document in details . &quot;
&quot; in the field of mouse @-@ click on the structural tree , the following action makes it possible to change the action by clicking on the struc@@ ted struc@@ turing with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the section of structural settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree can be opened automatically when using modification and as deep when changing the structural tree will be opened automatically . blank no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while blank groups are not found in the current document , no item was found . &quot;
&quot; the range to forti@@ fications from abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) , which are valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means , it can provide a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ ab abbrevi@@ ation something else means considered in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; here , the plugins can be managed . plugins are K@@ part @-@ applications from your third page , which can be re@@ used by each K@@ part @-@ capable application , on the most famous &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; in inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following is necessary : &quot;
&quot; address : the path to plugin , if it is not located on a stand@@ ar@@ tery like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib . &quot;
&quot; input : this information will be given to the plugin at the start , so it can open the current file to open the file folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; component in &quot; &quot; Just @-@ L@@ esis &quot; &quot; mode : check whether the plug @-@ in is refused to store . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts is usually refuse to store when this option is not chosen . &quot;
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : is this activated , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the set @-@ level information is correct , then when the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the de@@ bug@@ ging is completely new developed . the support for the db@@ g de@@ bug@@ ger was dis@@ continued , as well as support for the db@@ g de@@ bug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bug@@ ger plugin has been implemented , which allows different implem@@ ent@@ ations via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ire . &quot;
using the de@@ bug@@ ger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bug@@ ger plug @-@ ins in the project settings . using the button options next to the de@@ bug@@ ger @-@ Plugin selection field can change the specific settings .
&quot; if a de@@ bug@@ ger project is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface : &quot;
a view in which the contents of monitoring variables is shown . usually appears in the left Dock .
&quot; a view , in which all attitudes , numbers and conditions are listed , usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
&quot; a view in which the output is shown ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bug@@ ger , usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bug@@ ger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action , the connection to de@@ bug@@ ger , if necessary , or she shares the plugin with , to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ &apos;s needs . this promotion is opened by default when a project is opened , so that a de@@ bug@@ ger must not be respected . &quot;
the counter@@ part to de@@ bug@@ ging session Start the session . ex@@ cludes the connection to the de@@ bug@@ ger or termin@@ ates the foli@@ age according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to invite a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to look the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the view de@@ bug@@ ger issue .
&quot; indicates the de@@ bug@@ ger to begin with the execution of the script and to send information about the monitoring variables as well as the currently de@@ duc@@ ted line . when this happens when the script is continued , the execution starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; indicates the de@@ bug@@ ger to begin with the execution of the script , without providing information on monitoring variables and the current line number . when this happens , the execution carried out before the execution starts , the execution begins once a requirement is placed . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ bug@@ ger leads the next assignment in the script , without entering into the functions or includes . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ bug@@ ger leads the next assignment in the script , whereby if possible in functions and includes mis@@ use . &quot;
&quot; points the de@@ bug@@ ger to pass the statement and go to the next one , as if there are not the current ones . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog , in which a variable or an expression entered , which is to be monitored . the surveillance value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable is entered or a new value of variable . &quot;

this chapter describes how you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to adapt to your needs and how you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help to better become better .
&quot; document type E@@ di@@ pped packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to provide support for mark@@ - and scripts , as well as &amp; CSS ; to provide quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web@@ developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up @-@ languages and family 2 , the script files and the tool@@ boxes . day folder contain two data types , the tag folder and the tool@@ boxes . day folder contain two data types , the text folder and the tool@@ boxes . day folder includes two types of images ( above the E@@ di@@ tier @-@ window ) that could insert text and instructions faster in a document than a user each . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details for conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to create , then the &amp; called p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bar . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the peculi@@ ar di@@ alog@@ ist , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lo@@ x ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; self @-@ tool@@ boxes enable fast inser@@ ting tags into a document without a danger of a write error . &quot;
&quot; day @-@ folders are nothing but the folder . you only contain the &amp; called p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . day folder bear the name of the description language and version , so . ( for example , html ( 4.01 @-@ 4.01 ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and de@@ plor@@ es whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so many users have better insight and more information when working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in the individual . everything about the possibilities and limitations is described in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can occur only once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but contains only one element type about itself else . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when used is &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only family 2 )
only for the day type class is valid . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the type meth@@ od valid . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute and the attributes within this tags may be added to each other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text into the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day . this is a single element type element .
&quot; describes a attribute of a tags . this item can only appear for any attribute . it lays the name and the type of the attribute . additionally , there are other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc . this is a single element -@@ type item . &quot;
gives the available source tex@@ te for the attributes in the day Edit@@ or@@ dialog and in the attribute tree to
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p methodology within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used for achieving the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting and a method name . the arguments that are handed over to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , that means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a tank @-@ day displays the elements of a list together . it can occur for one attribute only once . it is a only elementary type element .
&quot; defines the position of the attribute of a tags within a dialogue . this day can only occur for every attribute , in a dialogue only once ( e.g. for each bed ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty . &quot;
&quot; returns the position and the size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each box , att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this item is empty . &quot;
returns a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this item is a single element type .
returns a list of elements that finish a day . this item is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ Declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ coding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be tidy and closed .
&quot; spaces have nothing but pay attention to &amp; b &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; to refrain from doing this will cause no leg inter@@ ruption , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to verify the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog above in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to start @-@ check and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ D . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available . at present , the check is only processed at the loading of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
in the following example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schem@@ atic &gt; -@@ element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ sch@@ ema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ coding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt &gt;
&quot; the &amp; called p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ file is just as simple and there is an editor to be accessible via DT@@ D Bear@@ be@@ ite DT@@ D settings ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created by following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; Version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D HTML 4.01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nickname = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a nickname . &quot;
an action can set up with settings actions ... click on New action leads to the same dialog :
the button @-@ defined short@@ cuts . with click the button user defined can be assigned a short@@ cuts ; with K@@ one is the current key@@ chain to be removed .
the simpl@@ est actions . it can be inserted a text in the detection settings and when carrying out the action this text is inserted in the document at the current c@@ ursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can use external applications ( usually script , but it is not limited ) to change the document or use ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves are the quick@@ start @-@ dialogue or the different scroll into ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter are specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ ting you variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scrip@@ ts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line : &quot;
&quot; % f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in the event of a local document , file : / from the name of the document . &quot;
% pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs the text unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; by the external script .
&quot; the parameters for this event , normally the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above listed methods can be a script input of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lo@@ os ; in the default field input can be determined , which is to send to the basic income . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually sensible with this attitude .
&quot; accordingly , the input can be re@@ directed to the output of the exec@@ uting application . there are two types of output : normal edition , written on the standard version ; it can be specified on the default output written by which the value is set to be set : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . in any case it is not too many , that &apos;s why you create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you must add actions and configure , select Settings . &quot;
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts the editing mode .
fill in all the necessary fields and add them to the fitting tool .
&quot; complete all and , if the day attributes , and you plan to plan their use , activate a dialogue &apos; day when available , so that a input for entering the promotion is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ugly symbol . who should remember the action with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ es ; choose from the &amp; menu ; , graphics more programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; default &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the aff@@ lic@@ ted symbol not only helps you to remember what the action is doing , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; in regard to that the day start , I have decided to create a button kno@@ b as a symbol . through the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as a los , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least insert a message to the user that click this symbol to insert a &amp; lt ; -@@ Day in the current document . &quot;
after the creation of symbol it must be connected with action . this happens through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored symbol is , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; then press the applying button and continue with other tags , so there are , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to complement some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lo@@ gs ; functions to the tool@@ bar , or it should be set to adjust this to better overview of several separ@@ ator into several groups . make sure that the tool@@ bar setting is selected . &quot;
&quot; I want to choose the den@@ omin@@ ator ( on the left above ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element you should add to the tool@@ bar , you press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I want to add a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note , as the den@@ omin@@ ator will support the group@@ ing . anyone who knows my tool@@ bar , could not believe that the c@@ ursor section ; -@@ Kno@@ pf is the opposite of the Start button . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by pro@@ pping of all the symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; do not exist in the correct folder . after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be im@@ movable folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be loaded in the correct folder . please match her tool@@ bar ( s ) if a file is opened from the appropriate type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user , the possibility to add documentation for the scripts , or to add the formal language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I use a &amp; PHP ; documentation for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory , whether someone has done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search an existing documentation for the form@@ ative / script / etc . language : then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we leave to you , the second one we treat here . &quot;
&quot; # KDE configur@@ ations file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = pf@@ ad , relatively to this file , for example , ph@@ p@@ 42 / # 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html # 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html # 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html # 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ .html 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ .html 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ .html 1 = 1 = 2@@ .html . &quot;
the section tree defines the visible section of the documentation in the documentary tree . for example , you see now in the &amp; PHP , documentation such as : &quot;
# KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level of the Top Element = PHP 4.2 Add = Table of Cont@@ ents = index.html G@@ etting Start@@ ed = In@@ tro@@ duction , ... In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction , ... Basic syn@@ tax = langu@@ ag@@ e.@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax .html ... &quot;
note the # before G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it deals with its own content ( except through the reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
remember that the contents of the contents are refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and in consequence at the top of the construction view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces have nothing but pay attention to &amp; p &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; tor@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Resources c@@ end@@ at@@ r@@ ots are replaced .
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is intended for the design of the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , if writing a &amp; PHP script ; H for context @-@ help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connector . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of by @-@ se@@ ated context @-@ elements that are to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c only and after $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / doc / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( so how to install it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , for example which documentation were used on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked on the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; are you not alone . it is possible that divide the resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ boxes with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anything else . at different places there is an email @-@ mail menu , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lo@@ os can be downloaded and only available if our team needs them to be correct and used for publishing . to make use of the resources , we recommend a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this way the origin of resources is ensured , both for our team and for later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading you are asked for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have to pass several keys . in dialogue with new resource , you will have to stay an excursion ( URL preview can remain empty ) and with click OK the up@@ loading will be started . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ loading can be up@@ loaded from the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , and in the context menu of files and folders in the Tem@@ plates and Skri@@ ll tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading an resource , yet before the installation , exam@@ ines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lo@@ x ; the dish@@ on@@ ess of the resource through testing the integrity and the signature . if the integrity given and the resource can be signed correctly , a message appears with the specification of the origin@@ ator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work with XML @-@ languages , which is currently not being created by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it may be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of day files needed in the convention format . it is the easiest way to convert an DT@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D shop and converting to DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which is to be used . afterwards , the following dialog : &quot;
target @-@ name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Defini@@ tional line : the string which in the ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Tag , such as HTML Public - / / W@@ 3C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.01 Tran@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ ml@@ 4 / 0@@ e.@@ dt@@ d &quot;
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lo@@ os ; after the conversion the &amp; called p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are some key concepts . to understand these to understand and to make full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; so this chapter is trying to bring them precisely these concepts , without whose understanding &amp; tor@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; little utility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for each one , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lo@@ os ; use , available . from tool@@ boxes to actions it is , in common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; saved . this enables the group of administr@@ ators to secure tool@@ boxes , actions and patterns in the global tree , which can then be available each in a multi @-@ user environment at the system . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ boxes . local items are stored in user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to work@@ boxes with special actions specifically for the files of a certain project . simply said , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folders and patterns of all staff within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edit@@ ors window , the construction views , the cart@@ ons with information and the tool@@ boxes . please hit , and for further information about these areas . &quot;
&quot; one can click the boxes with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current documentation , like close the current , other or all cart@@ els , re @-@ loading , delete or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a book@@ mark or version of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editors lead to another context menu regarding the edited document contents , such as basic processing steps ( cutting / copy / paste ) , editing of the mouse below the mouse c@@ ursor , or opening the file , if the string is called below the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor one file . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the Edit@@ ors , the tool@@ bar of the editors are at present &amp; breakfasts ; 4.01 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ boxes are shown . in the course of further construction of work@@ boxes , the tool@@ bar will be adapted to the new functions and that connected to the user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bar is really easy . if they want to insert an easy day , for example &amp; lt ; p@@ gt ; in your document , then click on the icon that has written several attributes ( like An@@ ker ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; construction views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate in the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , to open and for@@ ges . in the presentation with cart@@ ons are available for files , project , patterns , scripts , attributes , and documentation of construction views . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lo@@ os . this view shows all the files in the project and allows the administration of the files in the project by means of right mouse click . actions such as Hin@@ ding , removal , up@@ loading or delet@@ ing the files from storage medium can then be performed using the context menu . &quot;
&quot; another way of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all options open for you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on which connection they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the corresponding user and templates in projects are available only in the project . more about templates is available . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of break@@ down in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retri@@ eve the available information about a script . through the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script should be started or send with an email . &quot;
&quot; with this view one displays the internal structure of the active document . through links to a module , the c@@ ursor is set to the position of the element . due to the right click of an element , a list of commands opens up in terms of navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among the other construction views . with it , man@@ ders and nam@@ esp@@ ace can change . it allows the content of all available attributes with a few clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation for the web @-@ technology for your development . it can be downloaded pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lo@@ os ; you can create own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added and considered . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two cardboard boxes at the bottom of the window can be reached via the usable information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this type of cardboard is showing information about each in the quot@@ a current script . for example , the DT@@ D used to the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are shown . &quot;
&quot; this type of cardboard is showing all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; tor@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed , give all the error messages ( so there are ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bar are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the appropriate command . the chocolate @-@ side of the tool@@ bar is the opportunity to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to define it . &quot;
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with an email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as an infl@@ ated T@@ ar archive by &amp; k@@ mail ; if it is a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other . &quot;
it &apos;s reasonable when you want to adapt the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lo@@ gs ; it has to be given a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to make a complete list of all options you give . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed .
&quot; if you have problems with starting from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lo@@ gs , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H in front of their bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the KDE @-@ surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for a fast web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; -@@ Editor to create , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a seam@@ less idea ; a peculi@@ ar , exten@@ sible Mark@@ up @-@ languages @-@ editor would be ? well , this would be the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; not limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already far on the path to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then the appropriate &amp; IDE should be ; for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; now to the above claim must be det@@ ained that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lo@@ os is based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based on a good application of free software , the idea of why developers , which has already been developed to anyone else , but allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to extend it , as they need it for their need . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows Web@@ developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity almost every task . through the program you can increase &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ( more about it can be found in . )
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development plan designed for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a quick web development and quickly developed to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; connected to the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more in the details of the documentation is with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; conf@@ quer@@ or ; type , or k@@ help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta perform ) . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and super@@ vised by Eric Laf@@ fo@@ on sequ@@ el @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list is changing whenever you open a file , which is not on it , whereby the oldest entry is being removed . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look in the section on templates . should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project Vor@@ lag@@ en@@ ord@@ ner , only a mistake is reported . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ ts when inser@@ tion from the cli@@ p@@ board there contained special characters to the &amp; HTML , so that they are displayed correctly and are not understood by the browser as a form@@ ative instruction . &quot;
&quot; convert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ calls , which is the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is . first line to inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor day . &quot;
&quot; select the Block@@ sel@@ ection or off . this allows you to select text blocks , with the help of &amp; Shift ; taste . &quot;
go directly to a po@@ id number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script bug@@ fixes available !
looks a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
&quot; shows the message window to or not , which is the window in which you can see the adver@@ t of scripts and the de@@ bug@@ ger . &quot;
out@@ fitting and tear of the problem re@@ por@@ ters at the bottom of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ por@@ ter will be activated once you change to the struc@@ ture@@ tree .
shows the tool@@ bar left of the main window . this column allows you to put book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if book@@ mark book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries or next , depending on the position of the c@@ urs@@ ors in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other selected documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file . web@@ pr@@ j .
presented a dialog to add files to the current project . the selected files are then copied into the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows , for example to copy graphics files in your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add them to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded further inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project managed . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project you can find the details explained .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project you / tool@@ bar and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
&quot; a dialog to save your tool@@ boxes . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or Project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved by setting actions ... added . tool@@ bar will save the tool@@ bar , or you are asking when you want to save the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; remo@@ ves a tool@@ bar out of the range of visibility . delet@@ es not delete it from your hard disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar , you will ask if you would like to do it . &quot;
&quot; to send out your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as a app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ boxes to the main server , where anyone else can access it . see in . &quot;
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; that you have made or anyone else made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own descri@@ p@@ ation format .
&quot; loading of the En@@ ti@@ ties from the &amp; DT@@ D ; is useful when the En@@ ti@@ ties from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to renew , if this is global and a writing at the Global KDE folder is not available , fails to store the shop . &quot;
&quot; this menu features a list of tags , which is available in the currently charged tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is in the tags menu an sub@@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this factory . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day setup dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags always present , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ ting tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; tor@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , when this day goes against this place the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plugins are listed below the menu @-@ mentioned menu points . click on it . click on a activated @-@ plug @-@ ins de@@ activated . &quot;
select the syn@@ tax @-@ mode for the current file . the list of available Her@@ vor@@ es schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .

&quot; in addition , this menu for each open sub@@ window contains an entry . with selection of a entries the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
&quot; the display of the status bar on the lower edge of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window , respectively . &quot;
&quot; the changes in this dialog affects every application , which use the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browser . &quot;
judges the behavior of the Edit@@ or@@ fen@@ sters &apos; behavior . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you will find details .
a dialog appears that you delete entries from the tool@@ bar or which can add and change the sequences .
&quot; this should generate an assistance in accordance with the environment of the mouse , but it is not implemented yet . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free lic@@ enced but as with any open source project the developers can still support help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they can be found here .
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled best from above down@@ wards , for example after filling the project called the whole directories for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project properties can be adjusted later . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to enter , for example foo . when entering the name file is automatically filled . &quot;
&quot; this is the name of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in small case letters and without blank spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the directory directory . &quot;
&quot; here you can access the server address of the machine , to which one wants to access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if this field makes empty , the default settings of your chosen log file will be used . depending on the setting of the remote machine , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates will be saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the tool@@ boxes are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bar . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ es@@ ystem into the project . you can select multiple files or whole folder .
&quot; this setting is great if you have a static web content you want to download and change . in a different script ( e.g. , PHP , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; allow files that are to be integrated anywhere in the main folder of the project , if a project is started from scratch , not An@@ h@@ aken . &quot;
&quot; with this option all the files and folders are displayed within the main folder , and you can make a precise selection of a high @-@ th@@ inner property . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the files you want by h@@ acks or , through removal of the ha@@ iry , cl@@ ing out of the project . &quot;
&quot; the latest screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can upload files in the menu with project properties in the menu window , or with the short@@ cuts shift ; F@@ 7 changed . &quot;
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in . the additional items are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( space card possible ) which can be ignored on project @-@ related operations such as project folder .
&quot; suppl@@ em@@ ental option to above , also files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ signals are out of the project . &quot;
the project view that will be loaded when opening the project . can be read more about project views .
&quot; this way , the desired de@@ bug@@ ger can be selected . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ en can be found in . the de@@ bug@@ ger plugin can be set with the button Options . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles can upload high @-@ load profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a building view for the content of the server for any profile , adding a separate construction view for every profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration may be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; configuration configuration , you can switch off event actions and add these actions , change or delete these actions , if a previously mentioned event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project , which was opened . this behavior is currently not possible . &quot;
to open a different project to open the project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows you to select a project .
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
&quot; the project construction gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files in the current project can be managed . &quot;
folders typically act as well ; however the entries are missing and opening with ... in with the right mouse @-@ click context menu :
&quot; here , different profiles can be chosen . the profile contains information about the place of the highly accurate files . &quot;
&quot; enables the removal of the current profile . if only more a profile is present , the button bl@@ ends to prevent the removal . &quot;
&quot; the password is kept in the core memory and can be forgotten at Program@@ mes . this possibility is useful , if common high @-@ load files is necessary and the rather un@@ secure password can be saved on the plate -@@ option not in question . &quot;
&quot; this will stop the transfer or just leave the dialog , if you change your opinion before the up@@ loading . &quot;
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high @-@ la@@ de@@ profiles can be up@@ loaded and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded on different servers . at editing or creating a profile this dialog will be displayed :
that is the name of the server to be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address function .
&quot; the Trans@@ fer@@ protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your case @-@ shaft , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the plate , so that it can not be easy to read , but everyone can see it easily in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set files and tool@@ boxes . it can give a lot of views in a project , that is , by simply ex@@ changing the view , various files and tool@@ boxes can be loaded and replace the currently open files and tool@@ boxes . &quot;
&quot; views can be opened in the menu project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings of tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar , opened or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do most . this helps not only boost productivity but also allows modification of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; at its own way of working . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , work@@ tool@@ boxes are in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lo@@ os ; best about the menu tool@@ bar is designed . using and add @-@ tool@@ boxes are to be distinguished at the bottom in the section of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar and the symbols may be set to either using the context menu ( right @-@ clicking on the tool@@ bar ) , other actions can be used as tool@@ bar , the tool@@ bar or tool@@ bar can be set to indicate what actions on this or other materials are to be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context @-@ menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , in addition the additional entries will remove and action is displayed that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up the menu with settings tool@@ boxes ... and setting settings of your .. .
&quot; templates are essentially set of documents , code cut@@ lets and files as an exercise file system with expan@@ sive organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , move or link any of the existing folder in the submission room . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the limitations , which one stands for the fil@@ es@@ ystem . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions at the beginning of each template prior to use .
&quot; binary is all that is not pure text . it can be any file apart text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash @-@ files &amp; etc ; binary plates are usually included in documents via links ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the storage room under global templates . &quot;
documents can be created by any text document . on the basis of these templates new documents can be created . normally a simple sc@@ af@@ fold for the purpose and organized the work in appropriate ways to be efficient . some examples can be found in the storage room under global templates . see in for more information about Tem@@ plates .
this type of templates is useful if not a new document is put into documents based on a template but the same text area always included in documents . you can find everything from one comment to a complete menu on Jav@@ ascript or Perl base . see in for more information about Tem@@ plates .
&quot; as the name says , these templates for entire websites serves as templates . they are a collection of different documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a zi@@ pped t@@ ar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; design a document structure for popularity ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select file as templates store as a local template .... &quot;
&quot; once that has happened , you notice that ( even when it has been stored as a project system ) the template is not visible in the project tree . take a look at the back@@ yard under project managers . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click on file as a template , save your selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drag@@ ged with pul@@ ling and dra@@ inage on the design templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only copy in a storage folder . it can be used for all file administration functions , such as pul@@ ling and inser@@ ting or inser@@ ting the file tree of con@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can insert in the file tree or in the project files construction view to a folder on the right and secure site template . by default , it is secured in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as local or global template . &quot;
project managers allow a very target @-@ oriented advance . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ lines or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; additionally you can link some things to keep track of templates in projects very profound .
the storage structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files found in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / and / $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / im@@ printed files . each of this folder is equivalent to one of four types of container like above .
&quot; to set the behavior of a folder , click on the folder with right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu features , the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is decre@@ asing as soon as el@@ ter@@ ous attributes . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and adap@@ ts to everything except the tri@@ um@@ bers in the deposit overview . if a stem folder would appear in this path , it would be explicitly enabled . in the case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text box . if nothing appears , you will probably be in a regular ord@@ ner . &quot;
permits or modified text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or head@@ lines for all templates for a specific project and allows copying contents into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( to display , right mouse button press ) on a complete command collection for adding folder or copy and insert templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor to be accessible via the menu View . the first mode replaces the editing window in two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
&quot; the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or XHTML ; -@@ page and a c@@ ursor . then you can edit and switch to source code editor , in which the changes performed in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor in source code are visible . &quot;
&quot; working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor on a document , which includes &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor . there is no plans to change these behaviour . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly as the first one , except that at the same time changes both in the source code editor and the c@@ ursor in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor syn@@ ch@@ ron runs , this mode is already active , puts the active c@@ ursor to the active c@@ ursor from one window to the other , whereby the position in the document is maintained . &quot;
the synchron@@ isation of synchron@@ isation between V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source code is adjustable to select Settings Qu@@ anta .... After selecting V@@ PL ; -@@ View you can choose between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in principle the recommendation applies : a small ch@@ anne for quick calcul@@ ator and a large gap for slow .
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the tools of the website is made , so the processing of invisible tags in working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor will also be called , as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor , this is used to change the suspension of hands . thus , one can change the following : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a @-@ tags conf@@ use the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click into the list enables the change of content , e.g. key words on the column name and keywords key wor@@ t@@ 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way of design of watching sites in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons on the list . the editing of CSS @-@ rules is currently not supported .
&quot; it is possible to incorporate an external CSS @-@ style system by pressing to the File button , and select the appropriate file . &quot;
&quot; the use of the C@@ urs@@ ors is like in a text processing , possible by filling with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the c@@ ursor is beh@@ aves as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by ti@@ pping and delete or removal . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is placed in the same way across the tool@@ boxes , as in the source code editor , done . it is to note that the inser@@ ting tags previously already exist already existing identical tags , e.g. if an anchor day is inserted with text , every other surrounding anchor needs to be removed . &quot;
&quot; some work@@ boxes like the tables wiz@@ ard , or the lists assistant are disabled . you will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists are used . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for the examination of styles . unlike other programs for styl@@ istic templates , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style can be trac@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; to compile &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; successfully compile , need except &amp; k@@ de ; still the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ bex@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; &quot;
&quot; stop in a template , in one place in one of x@@ sl@@ db@@ g loaded style - or x@@ ml file or at the current k@@ not . new in x@@ sl@@ db@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db @-@ compatibility mode can be set up and activated in a certain file and Show number . &quot;
x@@ sl@@ db@@ g identi@@ fies the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a pole . fil@@ en@@ ame in the same folder as the top charged style file named x@@ sl@@ db@@ g is for example a style pre @-@ stor@@ ing .. / en / x@@ sl@@ hy@@ .x@@ s@@ l is possible for example :
this command is included in a partial or complete agreement with a pre@@ age named QNA@@ ME or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template agre@@ es with any QNAP ME that contain the string template .
&quot; each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the given &quot; &quot; QNA@@ ME &quot; &quot; will be extended according to the rules which is specified by the specified X@@ SL source file : test@@ 1 is &amp; eg ; expanded to http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1 &quot;
a requested post@@ ure must be solved for the related UR@@ I and Show number . this will automatically be executed when loading the first template through x@@ sl@@ db@@ g . they will be re@@ examined shortly after the start of each run .

&quot; the cor@@ relation was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes , while at the same time it had been corrected where time had been corrected , another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was many conflicts in merge together . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what changed within these lines . and there was no indication of what changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where changed this change was a little night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; this was the beginning , the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could be depic@@ ted differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , any more useful features were added . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want to compare text to an example , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the compar@@ ative windows . &quot;
&quot; a function made a lot of work , was the compar@@ isons and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a fully @-@ fl@@ edged file browser . &quot;
&quot; also 3 @-@ way together is fully supported . this is useful when two persons operate independently of each other at a piece of co@@ de and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps the dis@@ solve result of conflicts and shows simultaneously the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screens@@ hot shows three Qu@@ ell files when combined : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you in the compar@@ isons and merge complete folder . this screens@@ hot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; at the folder @-@ assem@@ blies :
&quot; general diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and den@@ otes about the possibilities of today &apos;s colour@@ ing monitors . if you have to check codi@@ les , you will like this feature . &quot;
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are visible . if lines are only different in a certain number of white characters you can see at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no trouble change when J@@ em@@ and changes ) .
&quot; if one file is the same , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both of them differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make yourself the ti@@ p@@ est work easier by using only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; diff@@ usion 3 folder , 1 folder @-@ 1 folder @-@ 2 folder @-@ 3 folder @-@ 3 folder @-@ 3 folders ( folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o target folder ) &quot;
&quot; the Open @-@ dialog allows the manual type of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting from the file browser file ( file ... ) or selecting an recently opened file from the list . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you set the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences are performed with two files . &quot;
&quot; select the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the compar@@ isons is selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ames from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if coll@@ ap@@ ori@@ zed , the input field is active and cannot be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to immediately specify a output file . you can also get this step later on saving . &quot;
the setup button opens up a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start together with the compar@@ isons .
&quot; sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active compar@@ ing window . the comparison starts immediately . in Open @-@ Dialog you do not have to choose files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
you can also use pul@@ ling and distr@@ actions : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall on a compar@@ ative window .
&quot; what thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively large effort . you would only have to upload two such files , it would be in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; download and then compare them . now , you can insert the relevant sections simply , and then compare . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , you can not remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the fall@@ out of text into a compar@@ ative window is supported . &quot;
&quot; warning : some editors interpret the pul@@ ling and desc@@ end of text into another program than output , and paste ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost . &quot;
&quot; in the upper part of each text window , the info @-@ line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the hands number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional ) , let the mouse change a while over the line . then a little aid window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed over the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , one can see the color , which file is different . if both files differ , the pre @-@ set color is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( merge ) good to see . &quot;
&quot; links next to the text is the composition column . if differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . with differences in white characters , the colour indicates that white character is not so important , it &apos;s useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white characters are relevant only in strings and comments , for the disp@@ essor and in few , rare items . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line that separates the composition column of the text , where the respective source file has no lines . if the source code is activated , the line is dot@@ ted on the set line . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the compar@@ isons ) has also a info @-@ line with the in@@ scription issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changed &#93; if you perform the result . usually it contains automatic composed text , but often it contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! to all conflicts are dis@@ solved is the store de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons to be closest / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ isons are used , each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the left mouse button in one of the windows the first line of the group will be shown on the line . ( this is also a jump of position in the windows , where the beginning of the group is not visible . ) This group will then be highlighted with the color back@@ color for the current sector and each of the left will appear a black beam . &quot;
&quot; sometimes by automatic direct or by manual work@@ es no more line left in the group ; then appears in these lines of text &amp; lt ; one line is displayed in source ; this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a mark@@ er that you may perhaps copy and slightly else . &quot;
&quot; however , the text &amp; lt ; con@@ duction conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources the options ignore or ign@@ oring C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like a white character . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ates mainly with the images and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you use in one of the windows you can use the arrow buttons on the right , right , down to the beginning , end , Str@@ g @-@ Start and Str@@ g @-@ end , si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
in the Aug@@ ab@@ ef@@ en@@ ster you can also use the other buttons on the mach@@ ining . with the inser@@ ting button you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ load mode . ( pre @-@ set is the one @-@ mode ) mode . )
&quot; a click with the left mouse button , in one of the summar@@ izing columns , the view of all windows to the start of the respective group ( as already coinci@@ de in the section and explained the edi@@ ble output stage ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons on navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( Str@@ g @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ above ) , to the next / previous conflict ( stress@@ ful image upward ) or to the next / pre @-@ resolved conflict . therefore , all dis@@ solved conflicts must be subject to conflicts between dis@@ solved and uns@@ ol@@ ved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark@@ ings into the cli@@ p@@ board , you must press the Cop@@ y button ( C@@ g @-@ C or Str@@ g @-@ inser@@ ting ) . if this option is enabled , whatever you highlight , automatically enter the cli@@ p@@ board and copy the manual copy , because you could acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; po@@ inters are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix versions use a row @-@ based system \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use wagon \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 keeps the for@@ cements of source files , so you should not use binary files ; also not with bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and re @-@ established in the next start@@ up . ( menu Sett@@ ings@@ - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also displays fonts with variable width to choose from , you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences in cur@@ si@@ ver are displayed . if the selected script does not support this representation , does not happen at all . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colours , some colors could not be available in its pure form but would be displayed . on these systems the kno@@ b pres@@ ets automatically displays an un@@ just color . &quot;
&quot; when this option is activated , the wir@@ ing of the tab@@ ulator key is inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a sp@@ ulator is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you are pressing or press the return , the rec@@ eding line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is activated , each selection will be automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . manually copy the manual into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
you can select which case type you prefer for stor@@ ing . the set @-@ set value is the generally usual choice of the operating system used .
&quot; in the compar@@ ing of files tries &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines in source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step is compar@@ es any line . in this step , white characters will not be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a Wag@@ gon plate &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a row , other again only be ignored . if this option is activated , etc. can be activated with different sizes in the side @-@ side comparison , however , like a white character may be disabled . during the default , this option must be disabled . in default this option is disabled . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , figures and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . however , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters . &quot;
the default option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
&quot; intensive after even smaller differences , the option is activated in default . it is effective at complex and big files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the Autom@@ atic @-@ recording mode , this setting will determine how long the results of the selection is shown before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; rede@@ em automatically all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source . ( pre @-@ set is manual selection . if you only need it from time to time , then use the Autom@@ atic selection also conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options do not ignore or ign@@ oring C / C + + -@@ comments . &quot;
these options are treated in the chapter on the scan of folders and announ@@ cements of a merger . look for details with documentation for the directory comparison and composition .
&quot; if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version exists the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already exists such a back@@ pedal file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
adap@@ ts the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you need to stop and rest@@ art@@ ed so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is global about the control center . )
the following codi@@ fication settings may be adjusted for each entry separately . if you have enabled this option for all entries the top settings is used .
&quot; over the selection fields for coding appears a brief reference , which is the local coding . ( this can not be changed here and has a purely informal nature . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file coding for source files . this influences how special characters will be treated and interpre@@ ting . as the coding for each file is adjustable individually , even files can be compared and combined with different codi@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a file , you can specify here which coding is to be used for stor@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files will be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code but the pre @-@ processing command can only be set with 8 @-@ bit ASC@@ II . ) With this option you can specify the coding of the output of pre @-@ processing command . &quot;
&quot; turn this off to supp@@ ress Her@@ vor@@ es of changes in white characters in the text or Over@@ view . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options ignore or ign@@ oring C / C + + -@@ comments . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all the differences between two of three files will be displayed . by selecting A &amp; b ; s ; B , A &amp; b ; -@@ gt ; C is listed as well as a second over@@ sized column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . bl@@ ends the less important window . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu . )
orders the compar@@ isons side by side or r@@ amp@@ on . this can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu . )
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click will start the con@@ duction and use the fil@@ en@@ ames of the latest source file as pre @-@ presented name for output file , then the name of the last used output file will be kept . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it is delivered first to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own preferences set exactly in your requirements . you can use this function e.g. to cut out dis@@ rup@@ ting parts or for correc@@ ting the rec@@ ycle . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it is given first to this external system ( see above ) , then the command of the command is used only in case of hands . you can write your own bonuses which corresponds to your own requirements . each entry line must have an associated output line . &quot;
&quot; the thought behind it is to enable the user to give more flexibility when setting up the sli@@ ff outcomes . however , most users do not want to program . the good news is however , that in most cases , sed or perl is completely sufficient . &quot;
use this pre @-@ manufacturing command for po@@ inters : sed &apos; s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; The \ \ 1 in the replace string based on the found text in the first gear string . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically create strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ key@@ word \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \
&quot; while you are experimenting with sed experimenting , you might want to understand it and maybe you might recognize these regular terms . they are very useful because there are many programs which support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ign@@ oring of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . however , it is good as an example for a further pre @-@ processing command for po@@ len@@ ght . sed &apos; / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 89.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos;@@ Every@@ one sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , so everyone will be replaced by anything . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ aliz@@ ations at once . then you can separate the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; , to separate the requirements from each other . example : &quot;
&quot; instead of sed , you can also use something else such as perl . perl -@@ p -@@ E &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switches &quot; Ho@@ wever , perl \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs perl only ( and ) without the &quot; &quot; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
&quot; the data after the normal price processor will be used for viewing and conduct , and the further operations change only the data that sees the ep@@ id@@ ols @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; note : in rare cases if you use a normal price processor , the show tag sees the output of the normal price @-@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the subscri@@ bers commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you can not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers in a folder have to edit many files . for this reason you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder re@@ tur@@ ized and merge . &quot;
... makes a suggestion for every object to assem@@ ble a proposal ; you can adapt the proposal before the start
&quot; can that simul@@ ate simul@@ ate and shows the simul@@ ated changes , without them really perform , &quot;
... &quot; takes selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 button ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 button ) , &quot;
this is the compar@@ isons and merge of individual files very similar . you only need to specify folder on the command line or dialog file .
&quot; if three files are assembled , then folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder is specified , no folder 3 ; folder 3 as a target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not match this , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or push the F@@ 7 button . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; during reading the folder you will notify a small message window of current progress . if you break the folder of the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to that date . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is complete , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left @-@ hand side , ... &quot;
&quot; each file and each folder of the scan was found , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together , by clicking on the + / - click on the object or by clicking the arrow buttons for the left / right . the folder @-@ menu contains two functions all sub@@ directories , and all sub@@ directories can be stored up or folders . &quot;
&quot; if you click on a file double , the file will be started immediately and it appears a compar@@ ative window . &quot;
the icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail@@ ing window to the selected object . in such a case the inter@@ c@@ utter action can not be automatically chosen . if that will merge together you will be informed about problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as seen in the above picture is to be seen in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; with identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical . then you also have the same color . when folders , the age is un@@ significant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf@@ let again , which is only green , then yellow , and later if it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if b does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( for example if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this cannot be started . &quot;
... a and B not have the same file type ( for example if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist cannot be started .
&quot; the mode for synchron@@ ization is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder is active . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... &quot; A and B exist , but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as the invisible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; directly after it merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. ) &quot;
&quot; if two files are assembled and the option new file will be picked up instead of a compilation . if the files are different , but the same date will be different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not eliminated , that the folder cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; during which coll@@ ects a file after the other . you will show a file after the other . it &apos;s status shows he@@ ed , and according to other messages if something in@@ expected , if the result is completed , you should make a final review and check if the status is happening all over the world . &quot;
&quot; if in the dialog method selected the file @-@ method of full analysis , K@@ ess@@ 3 more columns will display . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , detached , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts will only appear when three folders compared or mer@@ ged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either perform the selected entry ( File or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at one time . if you have selected all inter@@ locking actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start it together . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have not specified a target folder , then in the three @-@ folder mode , it will be used as a target and used while synchron@@ ise A and / or B as a destination . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , check whether all entries should be displayed in the target structure , also in the folder structure . there are some options ski@@ pped through the certain entries . check these options to avoid un@@ real surprises : &quot;
&quot; to match all entries : select &quot; &quot; Directory &quot; &quot; Start / continue in the directory -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cuts ) . to perform only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if through conf@@ lic@@ ting data types still exist un@@ invali@@ d actions , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; if you perform all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options run , simul@@ ate and break . &quot;
choose to simul@@ ate when you would only want to see what would happen without the really changes made . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a combined window will open ( note the screens@@ hot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are ready to start with a file , select once again folder / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog . then takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in a mistake , a message and detailed status information will be shown . on the end of the list you &apos;ll see some error messages that will help you hit the cause of the problem or solve the problematic entry . thus , you have the option to select another action for entry or solve the problem in other ways before you proceed to merge with that . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been made individually , notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and results in the later assem@@ bl@@ ings of all entries . even if this entries will be combined or not saved , these entries will change as done . only if you perform the merge action , these entries will be re @-@ assembled . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory con@@ duction with these options :
only files that fit on the specified pattern are displayed in the elementary tree ; separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid Plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . you do not need to comply with this pattern .
files and folder correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree ; you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a divi@@ ders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folder correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree ; you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a divi@@ ders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many autonomous files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder is set specific with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ age file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files are a bl@@ ender attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , an exp@@ elled point marks a file as hidden . this option makes you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the elementary tree or not . this option is switched on the default setting . &quot;
&quot; when links to files : when the option is off @-@ off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled . &quot;
&quot; when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links like normal folder will be treated and recur@@ sively checks . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible recur@@ r@@ ite lists lead to a fin@@ ite loop . ) This option is placed in the default . &quot;
&quot; displays a complete analysis of each file by and displays statistics columns . ( the number of sol@@ dered , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower if they contain files . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; when you compare large folder about a slow network , it may possibly be faster , only the change date and the file size to compare . however , this option takes you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is un@@ folded in the default . &quot;
&quot; similarly as confidential to the change date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal , if when copying the amendment to the Chang@@ ing Date . please bew@@ are with caution . this option is un@@ folded in the default . &quot;
&quot; activate the synchron@@ ize mode when two files are compared and no target folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions will be combined so that both folder are identical . also the results from together are stored in both folders . this option is placed in the default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences between the copying of the newer file as action . ( this is considered as uns@@ afe , as it is assumed that the other file is not also changed . ) This option is available in the default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or a folder is replaced by another or deleted , then the original backup file will be ren@@ amed and receives the .@@ original file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , this option is also applied without further backup . this option is also switched to the default folder . this option is switched in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; usually , the folder containing multiple files will be visible ; you can switch the window pond with the mouse . if you do not want , you can switch the option directory &amp; text window with a change between directory &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking here . however , you can install a single file directly , without the folder , the status will be placed directly and the file will not re @-@ run once again when you start the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost if you read the directory again : directory -@@ menu : new to read &quot;
&quot; KDE supports network transparency with the aid of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 used this for reading files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders for opening , that are located on local or remote computers . &quot;
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP @-@ server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a zi@@ pped archive with a local folder .
a URL has another syn@@ tax than local files and folder . a few things should be observed :
&quot; a path can be relatively un@@ think@@ able or .. . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolutely . &quot;
special characters must be mas@@ hed . ( # - &gt; % 23 , id@@ le &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example has a file called / # foo # the URL file : / % 23@@ foo % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the fil@@ es@@ ystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol . it follows a short list of constraints : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link shows a file or folder . then a file is accepted as a link @-@ goal . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
there is no possibility to process justi@@ fication or change date . therefore the per@@ missions or the change date from the original . ( note the option confidential of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files possible . )
the main purpose for the purpose is currently known as the differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op first always start the built @-@ in @-@ in viewer . to start K@@ ess@@ 3 push the right mouse button on the differences of viewer and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
&quot; usually , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files , takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . then , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the context @-@ section you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part , please note that this doesn &apos;t work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files has been changed since generating the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . this combined or the compar@@ ing of folders becomes not supported in the K@@ part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now He@@ ist , Comp@@ are ) are already existing . besides , the name k@@ diff@@ 3 already suggests that it can merge as the program diff@@ use from the Di@@ ff @-@ Tool collection . &quot;
I use GPL @-@ programs already very long and I learned a lot by playing in the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who went this way or go to him .
you have indicated the program from the sources and the configure script should not be announced the right pre@@ fix to KDE . in the default configuration configure / usr / local , but then KDE you can &apos;t find the resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this subject . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white character is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; however , the line is considered not identical . if the lines appear next to each other , this this is , but this is the case is the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor does not notice any difference in the files where he starts and where he ends . however , this important information goes easily through the clicks into the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is going to be saved as a text file , and it &apos;s a lot of effort to design extra a separate file format that could save this information . &quot;
the effort to do so far has been too big . you can restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text should be used to be another editor .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c left ; published and the text can not delete it . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used already many colors to highlight difference . even more gre@@ enh@@ ances would be conf@@ using and lacking the purpose . use a different editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ Fro@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og into the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to compile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; KDE @-@ dir gives you the folder in your system , installed in KDE . if you are uns@@ afe , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; because &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . should nevertheless occur difficulties , please report on the &amp; none ; -@@ Mail@@ ing@@ lists of them . &quot;
cut ( C@@ g @-@ X or Shift ) copied into the cli@@ p@@ board and delet@@ es the marked text . insert ( str@@ g @-@ V or Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ inser@@ tion ) adds the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current C@@ urs@@ or@@ position and replaces the current mark@@ ings .
&quot; only differences display : files that are identical in all folders , do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you need to upgrade to these options to the folder with the Update Update . ) &quot;
&quot; there are only entries displayed , which are differences . this also leads to that identical files in assem@@ bling these files will not already exist in the target folder . ( the behaviour is likely to be changed in a later program version . ) This option is due in the default . &quot;
&quot; please note the buttons to choose the source with the lab@@ eling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are already attached to one of the buttons ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed when clicking on the button . &quot;
in the default this option is disabled . under@@ differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , shows a mini@@ vor@@ tex of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite convenient to see the ongoing programs to change their size , ending it or move it . this works both within a work@@ space and several . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces as well as the applications in running applications . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to another .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a work@@ space as well as other employment surfaces . &quot;
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when on the empty background only the two entries are set up ... and ending . if however on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; if it was cli@@ cked on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and if the entries are minim@@ izing , maxim@@ ize on work@@ space and ending . the commands bring about the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . appears only if it was cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; sends the application to selected virtual desktop . appears only , if it was cli@@ cked on an application . &quot;
&quot; if this junction is marked , windows can be moved within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other areas of employment . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , are shown in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual work@@ spaces are displayed . &quot;
&quot; cross@@ wise this field lets the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , display the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces . it is shown along with name , the names containing or@@ bit@@ al@@ figures are provided , &amp; eg ; 1st floor space . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each working area is also displayed as a background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the current programs are displayed as a small window in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; you will only see the empty work@@ places to make their choice . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simple displays the windows with its standard symbol and pix@@ map showing a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; main window will be determined : classi@@ cally let &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , known as from P@@ ager applications in some other window managers , pun@@ ctu@@ ally shows all the virtual work@@ spaces in a wa@@ iter @-@ right and ver@@ tically in a sen@@ k@@ right line , which is very good for the presentation on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini@@ Program in the Control Panel . it has the advantage that it can be displayed in size , the windows as symbols or with its content can be displayed and move . furthermore , it runs out of the control bar . &quot;
click the right mouse button inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent extracts from switch @-@ up ... lets the dialog settings appear .
&quot; currently , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings settings , but you can do this manually : &quot;
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. If you do not need to register to user root or login to your system administrator . in this file you must register the key win@@ dow@@ Transpar@@ ent@@ mode and assign value to this value . possible values are :
da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base is required you need a functioning installation of the KDE package .

&quot; &amp; km@@ ag ; is a screens@@ hot . you can enlarge with &amp; km@@ ag ; one part of the screen , this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to include a full manual for the use of &amp; p . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ag ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly being extended by new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines . &quot;
&quot; when you start &amp; km@@ ag ; start a window like above . the main window of &amp; km@@ ag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . below , this window appears as an enlargement window .. The picture , which is shown in the enlargement window , is an enlarged section of the screen and is referred to as the selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , &amp; km@@ ag ; the area around the mouse c@@ ursor , like a mobile L@@ upe . alternatively , you can also create a selected screen area in the magnific@@ ation window ( selection mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse @-@ line at the screen ( eg ; on the left screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to avoid that the mouse c@@ ursor in the enlarged window will be displayed , select the setting of mouse c@@ ursor . please note , the form of mouse c@@ ursor . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ Mou@@ se@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can change it with the arrow and mul@@ lets and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse c@@ ursor in the magnific@@ ation window and hold the left mouse button down , so you can catch the content of the magnific@@ ation window and move . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally push the &amp; Shift ; taste or the &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only to move the lower right corner . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , into a file to insert it into other applications , to turn the picture and much more . &quot;
starts and stops the update of the ad . the update of the update brings you the required CPU @-@ time against 0 .
&quot; choose the Updated rate ( Very small , Ger@@ ing , means , H@@ och , Very High ) . the higher the Update @-@ rate , the more CPU @-@ time is needed . &quot;
in this mode a selection window will be displayed . the selected range is displayed in a window .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ag ; automatically uses your set command for stor@@ ing files , opening a new window , print , no@@ vices ( with the button ) once again load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlar@@ ging and res@@ ili@@ ms &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; km@@ ag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen magni@@ fier ; you can use a magni@@ fier to enlarge , so as if you use a magni@@ fier to look at the small printed in a newspaper or a photo . this application is designed for various people from the research , or artists to web@@ designer or visual impair@@ ment . &quot;
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / km@@ ag ( enter either this URL to the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; a or launch k@@ help@@ center help : / km@@ ag ) .

&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , once the mouse c@@ ursor one while at the same place . it is meant to help people suffering from the re@@ peti@@ tive strain of the jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and to which each mouse @-@ click sor@@ eness is prepared . however , this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; b@@ ous@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps to use so many people to merge the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can also attempt to p@@ ains that with the use of your computer , you should seek a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain , avoiding the clicks with the mouse , it is against pain that is caused by the loading of the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result may vary for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and guides a mouse @-@ click once you break the movement shortly .
&quot; is the smart turn enabled , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it em@@ ulates the mouse button . move the mouse , it is waiting until the end of the movement , before the release of the mouse button is executed . in this way , you can run the pul@@ ling with penet@@ rating right mouse . the intelligent temp@@ ting requires a little practice , but you get used fast to it . &quot;
&quot; this verse time must be pet@@ ri@@ fied after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; one mouse click here . &quot;
&quot; is Intel@@ lig@@ entes ste@@ amer ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here is the time set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after the shut@@ down the mouse is waiting before it leaves the mouse again , when in time there is no evidence of the mouse . &quot;
&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the click by mouse exp@@ ul@@ sion . is this function activated by clicking on the right and back a double @-@ click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt . the first time will start it but can be changed later .
&quot; if the sound is del@@ ayed , you can shor@@ ten the response time ; go to sound &amp; multimedia , choose a sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der sound bu@@ ffer that you adjust to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this feature is marked , is started &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; started with every start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available at GNO@@ ME or other window environments , please select the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; all settings return to values which were set when opening the dialog . have you already pushed the kno@@ b , the settings will be applied to the status according to the latest pressures . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with preference . in particular , the intelligent temp@@ ting you should first click first . if you then click on the automatic mouse click , you can later expand the intelligent temp@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it might be necessary to reduce the responses of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should consciously make yourself aware of which places a mouse @-@ clicking on no effect remains : the click on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window , which does not pose a link , does not leave to un@@ weigh@@ ed reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse stops , you should clean@@ se your mouse . it is usually pretty easy . the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to take the mouse ball . as this happens , the mouse is variable to mouse . however , it should quickly be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are located on the sides of the Lo@@ ches , in which the ball was used . the dirt and dirt can easily be with a flat blade or the F@@ ing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el Ab@@ kr@@ itch . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you just use a shoot . if you want to use the intelligent temp@@ ting , this means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , means that the operation can no longer end through the slogan of the mouse . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution to this problem is that you can run yourself a mouse click . here , the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be reset , and you can continue as usual . &quot;
problem : if you enter text is trying &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and set the c@@ ursor to another place .
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the c@@ ursor to place where you want to have it . however , you can no longer guide the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you are unable to give up the mouse clicks . safe zones for the mouse @-@ sho@@ cks are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bar and menus and the cover @-@ lines from windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent temp@@ ting to work , but I do not make it to edit text . &quot;
intelligent c@@ ading is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to copy it in the cli@@ p@@ board . but it will probably want to move around once more . here are some advice on this :
&quot; do not use the intelligent temp@@ ting not , if you just start using &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; select text instead as follows : run the switching back to the other end of the text , while you move the mouse button onto the other end of the text and turn the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this is the mouse button , if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the intelligent temp@@ ting you can use . later , you can also use the intelligent temp@@ ting without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some exercise . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test @-@ extension for &amp; X Window , which should be already the case on most system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and it is furnished correctly .
&quot; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; prayed with the mouse button as soon as the mouse c@@ ursor , shortly del@@ ayed . this program was developed for people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome and which the actu@@ ator of the mul@@ ant pain prepar@@ es . &quot;
&quot; b@@ ous@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; it can also be configured so a certain time is waiting for a time period begins , before the mouse is left let loose . in this way , the pul@@ ling and distr@@ ust can be carried out with the mouse . &quot;

&quot; and km@@ outh ; is a program , with the mu@@ te user who can speak to their computers for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; km@@ outh ; the user can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation , which should be talked again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of assist@@ ants ( left screens screen ) enter the command a , which is later used for the language versions of text . for more details see the description of the layout . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , you can select the default text@@ book . from the text box you can often choose text appropriate , without having to tap into . the text@@ area can be processed naturally . &quot;
on the third side ( right screens@@ hot ) you determine the dictionary for the word tran@@ script . &amp; km@@ outh ; read the KDE documentation of the selected language in order to determine the frequency of each words . in addition you can cancel the wording with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary . in addition , you can only be accepted the word list with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary . &quot;
the main window of &amp; km@@ outh ; is clear and contains essentially a input field for the keyboard assem@@ bler of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screens@@ hot ) and a memory of the already spoken movements ( the upper white field in the screens@@ hot ) .
&quot; if you have km@@ outh ; correct , you can input into the input field the propositions you want to listen . each other set will be attached to the memory of memory . they can choose from these propositions which should be returned again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry Settings km@@ outh ; set up ... open the introduc@@ tory dialog of &amp; km@@ outh ; this dialog contains two boxes , voice @-@ over@@ s and settings , the page Wor@@ l@@ ame , as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language . &quot;
&quot; in the field of the cardboard card voice @-@ over@@ s , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field under the input field you specify the text en@@ coding , with the text given to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; and km@@ outh ; does two kinds to pass the text , select the scroll field , when the text shall be disclosed as a standard one to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the cross field is not selected , the text is distributed as parameter . you can use the following dimensions : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice @-@ over@@ s depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation for your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; with as possible to use as a language service &amp; km@@ outh ; as the first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the further settings on this page will be ignored . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text area , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cuts or by choosing a text area in the menu text@@ books or in the bar for text books . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of so@@ fort , the chosen texts will be added directly and additionally included in the memory range . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text by the text will only be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second drop @-@ selection of the editing window , you can specify , whether the textbook for the editing of the editing window can be saved automatically . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of text box , the book will be saved . if you choose any changes , the text box will not be saved . select on Save returns , will be saved &amp; km@@ outh ; ask if the textbook will be saved . &quot;
&quot; the Site Wor@@ ter@@ i@@ fication contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the vocabulary . in the main window alongside the entrance field displays &amp; km@@ outh ; a selection field , if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection field , you can choose the currently used dictionary for vocabulary . &quot;
&quot; using the buttons , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the sequence of books or export them into a file . below the list you can set the name and set the language for the dictionary . &quot;
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; km@@ outh ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation a . the frequency of the single words is determined by un@@ count of the appearance below . in addition you can add the word@@ list with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary to insert only correct words into the new dictionary .
&quot; with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; km@@ outh ; asks , which dic@@ tion@@ aries are mer@@ ged , and how these weights should be . &quot;
&quot; with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; km@@ outh ; new re @-@ determined words automatically add into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary . &quot;
the main range of the window for the processing of text books is divided . in the upper part the text @-@ books are presented as tree @-@ structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit an selected item . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text by or the related key@@ chain . if you have selected a text string , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; action like new text@@ books or books add or add selected text appropriate and books , you can either reach the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a fold @-@ up menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text@@ books or text pass@@ angers , you can change through pul@@ ling with the mouse to the new spot or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this is used otherwise the selected ranges of memory . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text will be copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this is used otherwise the selected ranges of memory . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if text is located in the input field , it will be used otherwise , otherwise the selected sentences of the stream store . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is enabled , a shifting tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands , the tool@@ bar is arranged by default via the editing window directly under the menu bar . by mouse @-@ click on the cord @-@ left side and pul@@ ling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow cor@@ est is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints on the state of &amp; km@@ outh ; displayed when not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a mo@@ ve@@ able p@@ inch is displayed on the editing window directly under the tool@@ bar directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse @-@ click on the cord left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;

&quot; Festival is a language version of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ tically supported . the license allows you to use the festival for free and without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice edition , is believed that festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to language versions will be : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a in &amp; Java ; sel@@ f@@ ated language generator . currently it only supports the English language . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for the setup of the voice edition , is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et . language version is then possible with one of the three following commands : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option has to be switched as standard asset . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of Ph@@ on@@ gs in a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei so you need an additional program to dis@@ integrate the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
&quot; in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assum@@ ing that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la are installed . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax likes the last character of the text , so that an additional character has to be app@@ ended . the full command is therefore elaborate than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ e _ BAR / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option data is to be switched as standard product .

&quot; as the adjustment of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you need to use only as possible language as language service in &amp; km@@ outh . &quot;
&quot; to setting the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the setup dialog of &amp; km@@ outh ; appears if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ outh ; successfully to use , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; km@@ outh ; requires about 15 MB storage ( and additional memory for the language generator ) , but depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; and km@@ outh ; is an application with the people who cannot speak to allow text to be able to spend text by the computer . there is a list of already saved propositions , which can always be re@@ produced again . &quot;

&quot; when the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speaker are set up , the card @-@ card speakers will appear . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card card is displayed . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thesizer offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that are marked in volume or speed . you can also set up several variations for a syn@@ thesizer , voice , sex , volume and speed becomes as a speaker . you should at least use a speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; as the program speed @-@ D@@ isp@@ at@@ cher may otherwise use the standard spokes@@ man . &quot;
different actors for the same syn@@ thesi@@ zers are comparable to several print queue for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the cardboard box of the speaker in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card @-@ card speakers will display . this also appears automatically when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and not yet set up a speaker . &quot;
&quot; all the speakers already appear in this list . the preferred speaker appear above in the list . the number of speakers will be used for voice @-@ over@@ s , if an application does not exist . &quot;

&quot; filter filter@@ ing a good way to correct and correct . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which sends the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . you removed the tags and b out of the news , the mail sends , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , as this can be accepted as provided in most cases . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in Fil@@ ters , text gets edited , before it is sent to the Spe@@ ech D@@ isp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the discussion to select wrong voice or abbrevi@@ ations to select a suitable language and speaker or to deal with certain shortcomings of voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; speech D@@ isp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ on ; sets four types of texts . &quot;
the edition of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be presented to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of screen reader is read , the raised orders will be continued . &quot;
warning have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor will be too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after the issue of warning .
&quot; news have the highest priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of application , the news is used . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a web page , you can see with &amp; km@@ outh ; someone welcome you just the room . &amp; none ; -@@ noti@@ fications are also news . read about it . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text applications . each order , which you encounter from the card @-@ card assignments , is a text editor . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications used by card entries . text messages are intended for issu@@ ing longer texts , which have no special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four orders are processed in queue , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . when applying the output of a screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such it reads , this issue will be hal@@ ted and ended . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . you will be applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and texts as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News . &quot;
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are running as modules . in the future there can be even further types of filters .
&quot; text kett@@ l@@ ors replace parts of a text by other text , which allows you to specify either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is supplied with pre@@ defined string kett@@ les ( : - ) by text or for the format of messages from &amp; convers@@ ational ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better comprehen@@ sible form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ trans@@ former use a X@@ SLT @-@ file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to convert into another format . are some X@@ SLT files to translation by &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with speaker filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that send the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have for example on the card speaker for a female voice , you can read text by KDE news about it . read it about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these various filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to voice @-@ over@@ s . if the filter is fixed that its rules are not allowed , there is the text unchanged at the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text message , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; alert of &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent it , it is edited by all activated filters on the side below , processed by the filter is processed in the sequence from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the furnished normal filters . if a filter is not crossed , it is not activated and it will not be used . filters are processed according to the series from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will be shown on the following combinations . &quot;
&quot; for the setting of strings belts , you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as the compar@@ ative pattern . these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the associated spare text . large and classi@@ fieds will not be observed when compared . &quot;
&quot; give you a name for your filter a name . you can choose this name any number , it must only be different from the names of the other filter . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in column and replaces it in accordance with the string of the column . the list is shown in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; using these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file to save the current list or delete a file from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the available list . &quot;
&quot; here is one language included , the filter is applied only when the spokes@@ person speaks for the text entry one of the languages listed here . you can also select multiple languages if you click on the mouse @-@ clicking the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered , the filter is applied only when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by comb@@ at@@ a . example : convers@@ ational , k@@ mail &quot;
the application ID @-@ running programs can be obtained by the q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ bus ; number you must let away . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the applic@@ ation@@ ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 may only be copied .
&quot; the string ket@@ e@@ duct filter is applied only to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box , apply if al@@ ign . are all input fields blank , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of words , the symbol@@ ise filter regular expression in the form \ \ s Word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by divi@@ ders ( spaces ) both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will find no guide to writing regular extracts . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular terms , you can find in the package . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SLT files from a format into another format . X@@ SLT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such revers@@ als . but the auxiliary program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H
&quot; with the intercom filter you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can see for example , that texts by k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; add a text to the filter , there is a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker chassis . the speaker is selected by the speaker chassis , and sends the properties of the speaker card speakers . with the speaker filter you can write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is applied here , in case the text is applied to the given regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular terms , you can call this by clicking on the button to get help with the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you place the properties of the desired filter conditions . if the text selected the above filter@@ ing conditions , the speaker will be selected , which meets the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to show the dialog &apos;s selection . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your appointments or delete all settings .
&quot; the intercom filter is applied only to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box , apply if applicable . you need to enter at least one condition . &quot;
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with which programmers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API to be added using language syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD so that &amp; kt@@ on ; this syn@@ thesi@@ zers can use .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; K ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice @-@ over@@ s API of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice services on the &amp; D@@ bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ oria via the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
here is text of the text to read and option a language code as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are still more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you give
&quot; open two &amp; kon@@ sole , -@@ Window . start only on one window , then kt@@ op@@ sm@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ forming filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in the festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone , so you don &apos;t need to use it if you do not use this voice to read the web site . also , sure , that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c installed and can be found on the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain signs or notes appear to cause mistakes in syn@@ thesizer , so that whole phrases are over@@ thrown or only gi@@ der@@ world@@ ly spent . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure that the option is drawing to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain signs or words , they may be fixed by a string ket@@ e@@ duct filter . &quot;

&quot; the language syn@@ thesizer , which are used by &amp; kt@@ ts ; have their own license , which you can find in the associated documentation or on the websites concerned . there are also voices that have their own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the KDE source archive , you can download the package on it . &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can also find the source code from k@@ de@@ vel at ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the website http : / / support@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ages@@ .html . &quot;
&quot; American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibiza . &quot;
K@@ T@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer that can be started on the command line in a &amp; console ; it can be started .
&quot; the list of the above languages can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , draw the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . look at the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information that are not yet contained in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech D@@ isp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; uses a adap@@ table module for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ on ; for the use of another syn@@ thesi@@ zers , please contact the developer team . &quot;
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; to compile &amp; kt@@ on ; you need a current development environment of KDE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the un@@ folding files for the program &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech D@@ isp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source archive by &amp; kt@@ ts , downloaded from the source archive for k@@ de@@ accessibility or downloaded the tar@@ ball any night , then install and install the program with the following command : &quot;
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use first , check whether Spe@@ ech D@@ isp@@ at@@ cher is working properly using your language syn@@ thesizer correctly . you can use the shell script . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; that is the first version of Spe@@ ech D@@ isp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is said to be advanced , and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text will cr@@ ush in individual phrases . the user can proceed or break down , repeat the output or break down . &quot;
&quot; if an application is sent to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the issue . if you have a speaker , its language English and its gender is feminine , this will be automatically chosen the most suitable speaker . if you want to know more about it , how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker cho@@ oses to see you in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the cardboard card speaker to add or click on editing , the cardboard card speaker will appear . as an example is shown below the setup of the module for festival Interactive . details on the modules can be found under . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the detailed festival program . if the path to festival in P@@ AT@@ H , you just need to enter festival . &quot;
&quot; select the text en@@ coding for text which is handed over to festival . in voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this setting is automatically done . generally , that Western languages is to use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages like Czech or Slov@@ ak , use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , you put Volume , speaker speed and sound @-@ height of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a few Reg@@ ul@@ ators , the voice chosen by you the chosen voice cannot be displayed . &quot;
&quot; some voices such as multi@@ sy@@ n votes need to be loaded on account of their size several seconds . if you mark this crossing , this votes will already be syn@@ thesi@@ zed by the launch of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( for more storage power ) the first sentence is syn@@ thesi@@ zed faster . &quot;
&quot; if this anchor field cannot be selected , you have not yet set up any speaker ( or forget to apply to apply ) . &quot;
&quot; if this intersection is marked , it is shown at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after the start only the symbol of kt@@ op@@ gr is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to show the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this intersection is marked and kt@@ op@@ sm@@ gr is not running , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD does not read a text . this allows you to read or control the option . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders presented in queue , along with the application that has hired the contract , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the straight carried set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card @-@ card spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you may be selected in the order that is selected in the list below , or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes of settings ( also on the other card maps ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is res@@ ized to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to show the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the Sound@@ system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here , only text messages are listed and managed . issues of screen readers , war@@ nings and messages are not shown . for more information on the detection types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; please find in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio @-@ over@@ s . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the appropriate audi@@ om@@ o@@ du@@ l or kt@@ ops ; the necessary libraries can not load . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select at least one module , you need to install at least one module . have AL@@ SA selected , select the PC@@ M device . &quot;
&quot; insert the inter@@ phone speed here . 50@@ th ; % corresponds to roughly half and 200@@ 1. ; % roughly the double normal intercom speed . so these settings can be implemented , the program must be installed so@@ x . &quot;
apply to use the new settings for the current &amp; sort ; system to take over .
the list of AL@@ SA devices comprises all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you have to find out which device is working with you . in doubt you choose standard .
&quot; on this map , you can set special promotions that will always be executed when the text yield from a message will be interrupted with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders : &quot;
the edition of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be drawn to all other orders and keeps these orders . after the output of screen reader has been read , the raised orders will be recorded . &quot;
warning have priority priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor will be too hot . a warning holds the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after reading the warning .
&quot; News have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you &apos;re on a long text on a website , you can see with &amp; km@@ outh ; nevertheless someone welcome you just enter the room . &quot;
&quot; if a text message is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio is the queue in queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text is interrupted . if both in@@ conduc@@ tive sound and introduc@@ tory message is active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card ticket apply only for normal text messages . for messages , war@@ nings and the issues of Screen Re@@ funds there are no special promotions , if these are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages to be read , start rec@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click aler@@ ts . the card aler@@ ts will appear . &quot;
&quot; highlight this junction , to switch the pre @-@ reading &amp; none ; it is not highlighted , the remaining settings are disabled and kt@@ ts ; reads no noti@@ fications before . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is highlighted , noti@@ fications when a sound is ab@@ used , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or remove it . if you click on the button Add , enter the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message before , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone mentioned in a IR@@ C message your nickname . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which in the list nothing else is specified , are of &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored . &quot;
&quot; use this selection field to set what &amp; kt@@ ts ; should you specify , if an event occurs . you have the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you have selected text @-@ defined text , type the text you want . you can use the following dimensions : &quot;
&quot; you can enter the properties of the desired speaker . default select the speaker , which will be shown in the list on the map speaker as the top card speaker . see this also . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . is defined for a specific event of a particular application , this will be executed . otherwise , the promotion will be executed for all other events of certain applications . as the last chance , the action takes place under standard ( all other events ) . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this purpose you can specify the pre @-@ passing noti@@ fications as follows :
use the button save to store the settings for noti@@ fications in a file . use the button to load stored settings from a file . if you want to begin with an empty list click on Del@@ ete . all entries are deleted .
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for a voice &apos;s voice , the speaker speed , the volume of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , a further W@@ 3C standard . &quot;
currently stands &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partly and only in the basic functions . the following limitations are available :
&quot; you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone Voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , because this is the standard dis@@ agree that the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or sound situation in the festival configuration dialog is not on 100@@ A , SS@@ ML text is usually called very mon@@ ot@@ on . &quot;

XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ coding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ Syn@@ thesis / / EN &quot; &quot; http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / Spe@@ ech @-@ Syn@@ thesis / syn@@ th@@ es@@ is@@ .@@ dt@@ d &quot; &gt; Who has slept in my bed ? asked Mama bear . who has in my bed ? asked the Bär@@ en@@ Child . &#93; &#93; &gt;
&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional know @-@ filter filters ( SD@@ S filter ) . SB@@ Ds share text in single phrases . this allows you to read or stop the first set before , as only the first set of syn@@ thesi@@ zed or stop or break down , even if the syn@@ thesizer does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the pun@@ ctu@@ ally bound@@ ing filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as a pro@@ posi@@ tional cl@@ amping filter filter automatically . you can change its settings or add further pro@@ posi@@ tivity lab@@ eled filter , but it will be off . &quot;
&quot; in the easiest way you learn the setup selection through extracts . place your appointments again , select some properties and check out how the selection of the speaker is changed . of course you need to have set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ on ; then faster with you can start reading , as only the first sentence has to be processed and not the entire text block , which can last very long . &quot;
you can then pause or break out on the card @-@ card assignments or break down even if the syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
&quot; for these reasons , the normal pro@@ hibition filter is automatically established when you start kt@@ op@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off only . change nothing at this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
pun@@ ctu@@ ally un@@ mistak@@ able filter compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a sp@@ readsheet ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the stat@@ utes ( dec@@ imal characters are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter is attached from the text ( Fil@@ ters ) .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( k@@ ills ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed out the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional loss filter filter , you can insert this again by pressing the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file ; un@@ locked file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c . &quot;
on the card @-@ card appointments you can write the intercom settings for the application . the card card is displayed when
use of the standard tab ( the top on the card @-@ card speaker ) . in other words : there will be no inter@@ viewer .
&quot; the use of the most suitable speaker , which indicates all the properties of a single speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , the most frequently introduced properties is equivalent . &quot;
select the method for entering the desired language properties by clicking on one of the choices .
&quot; select the properties of the desired speaker . if this property does not play a role , you give nothing . &quot;
&quot; highlight this junction , when the property shall prevail over other properties . you can also set here several mark@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; because the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a priority feature . the only case with which you possibly want to specify the attribute , if you know that a certain application text will be shipped in another language than that in the work environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the range speaker , the most common to the following is to delete , click on the selection button @-@ speaker , and then use the speaker , which is closest to the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case 0 for the last text yield in queue . you can also specify a order number . ( no order number is the input 0 required ) . &quot;
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr cr@@ ashes immediately when it is started . I re@@ compile Deb@@ ug support but I don &apos;t get back .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is cr@@ ashed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; probably you have to register G@@ stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved by G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is possibly a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can attempt g@@ stre@@ amer to update or un@@ install .
&quot; the audio version of AL@@ SA does not work when I play music playing at the same time . if I consider a text message , it free@@ zes , one . on the &amp; console ; appears a message that said : &quot; to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system there is the problem that conflicts arise at AL@@ SA , which can prevent a simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . references to possible solutions can be found on the website of AL@@ SA @-@ Project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ project@@ .@@ org. &quot;
I have installed an additional voice for the festival on the internet . I have installed it and I can use it in festival but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice .
add to the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / festival@@ int / to the other entries . if you are successful then please send a Patch together with the &amp; URL ; to which you have found the voice to the developers .
on the card audio is there a setting speed . so this works that the program has to be installed so@@ x and via the ambient card P@@ AT@@ H application . some syn@@ thesi@@ zers such as Festival Interactive can offer itself on the map for intercom device an adjustment for speed . depending on the chosen voice this is active or in@@ active .
&quot; the settings for the inter@@ speed will be ignored , if &amp; weight ; and HTML ; ( this is because of your own tags for conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you are very cour@@ ageous , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; ( see ) , and set the conversion speed . &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t make it to be read with a female voice . I have created a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
at the festival 1.@@ 95 beta the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not work to function . so the festival does not reproduce the x@@ s@@ l file for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags . the same applies to VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added one &apos;s own symbol@@ ise filter filters and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more sales - or go back . on the box &apos;s orders is displayed just out of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
&quot; notes ( point , question , badge , com@@ missions , and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) must not be filter@@ ing . for these signs instead use a filter for the pro@@ posi@@ tional detection . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; sound architecture ) . AL@@ SA is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ project@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.7 or newer . note : make sure that the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer ( http : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio edition . if your system also includes music , you can not at the same time playing music and then start a text , if you find a text order and then start another . possible solutions to this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with stand July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support real breaks . if you keep a text entry in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will be read yet . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general adjustment of the consultation speed , but otherwise it is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs already included . &quot;
&quot; have you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ts ; as tar@@ ball ( with t@@ ar @-@ packed archive ) , sign up as a normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . change in this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ de , 4 will be the Module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least to be made on request . &quot;
&quot; the following modules for voice syn@@ thesizer will be created by default . some of them possess a run @-@ time dependen@@ cy of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Deb@@ ian distribution ) . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Deb@@ ian distribution ) . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Deb@@ ian distribution ) , the configure parameter shows the configure parameter , which causes the transmission @-@ parameters . &quot;

&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use first , check if your language syn@@ thesizer correctly works . follow the instructions you received with the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is evident . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are multiple voices and languages . with many voices you can adjust volume , speed and sound level . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that are supplied with festival , you need to install the ( male British ) Voice Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , therefore you need the source code of festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on disclosure . &quot;
this voice raises Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in a early stage development . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / etc / Russian / . if you set out the Russian votes you need for the votes ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . choose a cy@@ lled ( 8 bit@@ - ) coding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions are therefore first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option should be adjusted to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option should be adjusted to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ril@@ lic such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la , syn@@ thesizer . then the festival takes over the l@@ ex@@ ic@@ al@@ ic analysis and c@@ mb@@ ro@@ la ; this includes the audio @-@ over@@ s . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la , programme and the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; - voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; no complete voice system is . &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; generated language from Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this di@@ ph@@ one@@ . t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also create from german texts Di@@ phone . more information can be found under .
&quot; in this method , additional W@@ rap@@ per code added to festival is added to use &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voice to voice syn@@ thesis . note that the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; files are not installed in &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ folder , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found under
&quot; IM@@ S German Festival is a changing version of Festival for German &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; votes . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first , you install the Festival und &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; then download MS German Festival &quot;
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package that you have downloaded - ( for use with Festival 2.0 is required to translate into the error correction ) . then add the following lines into the file festival / lib / sit@@ it@@ it@@ .@@ s@@ cm .

&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ ist language syn@@ thesizer , which is written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; virtual machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; can neither tone , volume or cable speed . &quot;
the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ on ; with any voice syn@@ thesizer that can be controlled in a &amp; console ; on the command line .
&quot; best use a command to send the voice edition to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of send the output directly to the audio track . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which allows the management of network interfaces , rout@@ ing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows users to manage a range of system and desktop settings on a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed through selection of K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP networking settings in the same way , as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the following tasks : &quot;
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings is displayed in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not installed . physical equipment and their drivers need to be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device does not at all shows and the setting of network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed in installing &amp; Linux ; installed network devices later , the drivers will need to be loaded automatically by adapting the following files , corresponding to the core version . &quot;
&quot; the network settings will be loaded when the option Settings is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index selected . when starting the module &apos;s module , this , the platform will automatically identify the system automatically . &quot;
&quot; if the platform can &apos;t be recognized , the hands selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and release notes can best be made . by selecting the settings non @-@ again query the setting will be made automatically . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will be automatically set . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is possible only in the system management mode . previously , all options are grey , which means , the settings can only be considered , the change is not possible . in the system administration mode , you will be required at the right bottom of the module . it is the entry of the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this one is divided into three riders : &quot;
&quot; the rider network interfaces is intended to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network interfaces , the following tasks can be carried out : &quot;
&quot; the settings at the interface can set up by selecting the desired device in the list , and click on the button @-@ button interface ... in the dialog unit . &quot;
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button to show the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; with the selection automatic , the TCP / IP @-@ settings is done by an DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP @-@ settings will be required at the same time with the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server is required at the same time . in the selection list may be either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , selected . &quot;
with the selection manufac@@ uring can be made without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP @-@ address the sub@@ network is to be set .
&quot; if this option is highlighted , the system initi@@ alized the network interface in the boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values given in this dialog are shown as features of the device in the device .
&quot; it should be assured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the entry of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
network devices may be activated or activated on demand . switch on an out@@ dated network device made by selecting from the list and click on the interface ...
network devices may be activated or switched on as required . switch on a activated network device made by selecting from the list and click on the interface ...
&quot; placing the IP address of the machine in the local sub@@ net , which gives the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub @-@ networks . &quot;
&quot; if the computer is present more than a network interface , the interface needs to be selected in which the gateway @-@ Computer is to be selected . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name . this is necessary because computers can only be able to understand IP addresses . if the computer can only understand IP addresses . if the computer has only IP addresses , the DNS replaces this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
the machine to the nam@@ esp@@ ace of the equ@@ estrian solution enables easy management of this list . entries can be added or altered . DNS entries can be ordered by selecting a entries or res@@ eller in the list with the buttons and set up in the priority .
by clicking the button click ... from the group to add a DNS server . it will be added to the New Nam@@ eser@@ ver dialog .
&quot; first , you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button . the entry is inserted in the list . &quot;
from the group computer to the nam@@ esp@@ ace choose an entry and then click on the button mach@@ ining .... It will be shown on the dialog Edit .
the list of well known computers describes machines @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily with boats when no DNS servers will be available . in small , closed networks can replace it DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list of well known computers contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . these are still in the test @-@ being version of IP should replace in the future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP @-@ address of the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator and click on adding .... The dialog New Ali@@ as is displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known machine , enter the Add button . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has sent multiple ali@@ ases , de Kno@@ pf Add several times and enter the other Ali@@ as name . &quot;
select an entry of a well @-@ known calcul@@ ator from the list and select Edit .... The dialog &apos;s acquain@@ t@@ ances will be shown .
&quot; it can be one of the following tasks to be executed , then by clicking on OK , the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes , must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net to download the latest version of the source .
for the installation of the binary distri@@ butions ( usually r@@ pm packages ) it ranges if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the r@@ pm package and in a &amp; console ; with r@@ pm as follows :
alternatively you can use a tool with graph@@ ically surface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution .
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally the development packages are required with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is only recommended for experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and compile it . the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology will be given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change@@ able configuration files are discussed . &quot;
&quot; this area can not replace more knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information on the integration of PCs is introduced in a small ( home ) network . &quot;
&quot; currently IP @-@ networks operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never seen major distribution . by IP@@ v@@ 6 , this description focuses on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is aware of what IP address of a network interface is available . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the contact address , which is a valid IP address available or if available , DH@@ CP may not be chosen arbitr@@ arily . &quot;
&quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen specifically for this purpose to avoid IP address addres@@ see with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded on the Internet , therefore its use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet can be made possible for such machines by setting a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
for smaller networks are mostly used in the area of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the range is for networks to 250 computers large enough .
&quot; in addition , the network mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , which requires the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP rout@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the line @-@ address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of a personal so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this section , the configuration files , which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes dynam@@ ically changed at DSL connection , so that it is not surprised if in case of active DSL connections to other content is defined there . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file will be sorted through the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another level as awaits can therefore occur . &quot;

&quot; it is a backup programme for band@@ ages on the basis of t@@ ar . it offers the opportunity to save multiple archives on a tape . the first goal was to create a surface for t@@ ar , which followed the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ t@@ ar to the fast , selective ej@@ ector . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife does : how much longer takes it when you secure ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be bound by &amp; k@@ dat ; that can happen to three types : &quot;
&quot; kis@@ ses the band back and reads the pre @-@ tension information of the Ban@@ des . recognize &amp; kne@@ es ; the pres@@ ets on the tape do not , you will be asked if the band shall be form@@ att@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; det@@ ects &amp; kne@@ es ; the fore@@ play , looking for the right index on your plate . can this not be found , you are asked if the Band@@ index will be new . &quot;
&quot; if everything is smooth , it changes the symbol for the band &apos;s drive to indicate that the band has been integrated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be searched for the tape for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before leaving the belt , first the integration must be solved . there are three methods to achieve this . &quot;
&quot; then by changing the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration was solved for the band and shows in the status bar a corresponding message . the band can now be rejected without risk . &quot;
&quot; before a tape of &amp; k@@ dat , can be used , it must be formed by &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ att@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; a band @-@ card must be form@@ att@@ ed before you can use to save data . this process does not need to be used to save data . this process does not need to be done before using the tape . flo@@ ppy disk drives usually do not put an form@@ atting of the belt , DAT disk drives on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band@@ name and the capacity goes &amp; cold ; with the form@@ atting of the belt , all the data on the tape will be lost ! after the completion of the formation process , the band is automatically integrated and can be used . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the safest files . this can happen to three types : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it is saved only that file or folder .
highlight a backup profile in the tree . only the files stated in the profile .
highlight files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so @-@ marked files and / or sub @-@ folders are secured .
right click on the local file tree and select in the menu ...
&quot; once the backup has been initiated , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog , you can check once the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialogue will be informed . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
highlight a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it is checked only the selected file or folder .
highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . there are only the marked files and / or sub@@ folders .
right click on one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
&quot; as soon as the testing process was started , the dialog settings for re@@ viewing . in this dialog , you can even check your choice and change the working folder for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the testing process as well as the data processing and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can initi@@ ate the re @-@ establish , the files that should be restored , marked . this can take place in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives which include entry for the band@@ width . it will be restored only the selected file or sub@@ folder .
highlight the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . it will only be restored the desired files and / or sub @-@ folder .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and choose in the menu ...
&quot; once the recovery process started , the dialog settings for restoration . in this dialog , you can even check your choice and change the working folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialogue will be re @-@ establish . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data processing and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , it proves to be necessary to create the band inde@@ xed file from the band@@ content . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band : &quot;
&quot; in this way , a backup profile will be created with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup of the following settings : &quot;
the current work@@ folder in which the backup should be done . the list of insured files will be updated automatically according to the currently selected working folder .
&quot; for all folder , which are listed under f@@ use files , that only those files are stored on the same file system , as the folder . folder that are stored on other fil@@ es@@ ystems , you can add separate under backup files . each entry is considered by t@@ ar independently of the others . &quot;
&quot; perform a incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files are saved , which have since changed since . &quot;
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
&quot; delet@@ es the snap@@ shot file in front of the call of t@@ ar . this causes all files , and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup will be created . &quot;
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; lt ; files was not yet implemented yet at the time of the creation of this documentation .
you can set the settings via the Menu Menu ... in the Settings Settings . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device &apos;s device for the band@@ width ( usually / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ recur@@ ring version of the band@@ unit .
&quot; if this adjustment is active , transmitted &amp; cold ; before the band is involved , the command will load on the drive . with some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the throw @-@ off at the band &apos;s drive . possibly this setting does not work with all band@@ ed works . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched , when solving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically the band is k@@ ick@@ ed out . use this option not with Flo@@ ppy Stream@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched , tries &amp; cold ; the hard@@ war@@ es@@ ei@@ c block size for the band@@ width . not all drives support variable locking sizes . regardless of whether this setting is active or not , you must communicate a block size for your band@@ width . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; Stories : a volume is form@@ att@@ ed , it writes a file to the start of the belt . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the content of the file will be composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( N Byte ) The Band @-@ ID . the format of this text sequence is : seconds , whereby calcul@@ ative name is the complete name of the system in which the volume was form@@ att@@ ed . seconds is the number of seconds that has been formed since the epoch in which the band has been form@@ att@@ ed . &quot;
the band @-@ ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat files .
&quot; the remaining files on the band are pure t@@ ar -@@ Archive , who can manage directly with &amp; GNU ; - t@@ ar manage . even other t@@ ar -@@ versions should work , as long as it is not an incre@@ mental f@@ uses . &quot;
check the content of a backup bank . this symbol is only active if a band is involved .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; spect@@ ator for system protoc@@ ols . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system allows you to access information about problems that may occur on their server .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users to understand what your computer is making in the background . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who cannot know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system determines the different protocol files .
&quot; furthermore , &amp; ks@@ ystems log ; experienced users access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced functions , using the protocol files of certain programs to be fil@@ tered and evaluated . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; a number of useful features include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of sys@@ log servers and for sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included in this chapter and are explained in the other chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following screens , displays &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; features available , with their help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily fil@@ tr@@ ated and fil@@ mm@@ ed . the individual possibilities for sor@@ ting and filter@@ ing are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after starting to start &amp; ks@@ ystems log ; first the main protocol files of the system - to open . will you not appear , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you have access to Linux usually in the folder / var / log , for normal users usually no justi@@ fication for reading . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter@@ ing bar to filter on a selected crit@@ erion or after a given string . the list of the log lines will be displayed automatically , so that only the log lines will be displayed . in the default setting , the drop @-@ line contains only displayed when in one of the columns the string of the filter is included . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can also select another entry . the string chain of the filter search procedure will then be displayed only with the entries in the corresponding column file . select for example in the protocol files the name of a process , so shows you &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all protocol lines sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is activated in default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of stage errors are displayed as a protocol @-@ lines of level notice . the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched on dialog .
&quot; for example , you only want to display certain process ( e.g. in the system protoc@@ ols or in cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can examine the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case you will use filter@@ ing bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all the new upcoming protocol lines . &quot;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature in the menu window to open additional sub@@ window and to manage . once you have selected a sub @-@ window select a protocol on display .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ org. You can find more information about the sale of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archives : ks@@ ystem@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more well known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; this section takes a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sys@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it develops rapidly to the standard for inspection of the programme at high @-@ end of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world , because it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I know nothing about it : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not among / etc . this is therefore important , because maybe someone could try to make a machine on System V In@@ it , without having a re@@ install and re @-@ format . therefore , you must make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it is also different from the BSD in@@ it , that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder / etc are located directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folder : &quot;
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service that you want to start by the system or changing to another Run@@ level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things such as set@@ ters , which only once started . such views belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
r@@ c.@@ local should be in its turn under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d you need it . most systems possess this file even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also leave a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to carry out something that has to do with the seri@@ ding connection .
the kernel looks at different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first he finds .
the default Run@@ level is registered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the pre @-@ set Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can fix it and execute the 3 . be very careful when you start your system re@@ boot the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that in this folder do not find correct files . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
&quot; how does it start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is so written , that it is an argument like start and stop accepted . you can now start this scripts in fact from hand on the command line : &quot;
&quot; this would hold the htt@@ p@@ d Server . in@@ it reads the name , and when the one K contains , the script will be called with the argument stop . if he includes a S , the script will start with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server @-@ running level , that leaves just htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . moreover , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sys@@ v . you should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; with a mouse or another po@@ inter is simple to not say tri@@ vial : drag an entry from the field of Avail@@ able system services on one of the six Run@@ way to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you may change scripts , move between Run@@ lev@@ eling or change the position within a level by removing it elsewhere . this will only happen if they draw an entry from the field of the Avail@@ able system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved , if you choose them in a new area . to select them merely on a new Run@@ level , you need to expressly select from the menu editing or from the context menu and even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ ting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated , in such a case you need to edit the sor@@ ting numbers of the surrounding entries , before you can again try to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , there is no possibility to restore entries that have been thrown into the tr@@ ash . be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator button to activate the different operations ( Avail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the c@@ ursor buttons to make a range of above or below the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another Run@@ level , move it by cutting into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired Run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sor@@ ting number or the name of an application manually , press the key button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by writing the button button to change the changes , or push Es@@ c to change the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data transfer , all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are taken from the Global File ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; restored changes to preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard @-@ Run@@ lev@@ eling and now the machine starts resistant to new ones . what can I do ?
&quot; enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the entry button to start in the single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and modify the default Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) . &quot;
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; provided for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE , or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you must edit additional files in / etc that are only present in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way , such as system services are started in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; are planning an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use a different distribution : check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the relevant system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) will simply end without notice , if their configuration files are not present or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the importance of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is adequate , the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you must save it . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or the entry stor@@ ing in the menu file . &quot;
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cardboard cards , the user and user interface . to the editing you choose the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ clicking on the entry . it appears the dialog &apos;s or group properties . &quot;
&quot; some cardboard cards are shown only if you have enhanced system settings . only when you have enhanced system settings . only if you are able to make individual settings , if shadow &apos;s passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ ces are installed . &quot;
&quot; the card @-@ card Pass@@ word administration appears , in case of shadow &apos;s passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ ces are installed . &quot;
&quot; this card @-@ card will appear only if for at least a specified file system ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable on the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ es@@ ystem ) . here you can change parameters for each user , with the limited data are available in KB : &quot;
these parameters can be adjusted individually for each fil@@ es@@ ystem . the current file system is selected with the help of the field fil@@ es@@ ystem .
&quot; card @-@ card groups inform@@ s about the group members of the selected user . the standard group , which the user belongs , can be found in the prim@@ ous group . furthermore the user can mark the user in other groups by marking them in the big box . &quot;
&quot; the dialog features of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
to add a user or group to add an add from the menu user or group or click the matching Add @-@ button of the tool@@ bar . the editing or delet@@ ing the selected user and the selected group will be analog .
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO @-@ Boot@@ Manager , remove and modify the time up to the boats of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change operating systems , change , change and more . &quot;
