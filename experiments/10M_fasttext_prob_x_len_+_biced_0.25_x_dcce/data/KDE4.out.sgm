<seg id="388">"this tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve an image in most cases. therefore, use it before you try a further manual process."</seg>
<seg id="389">"normalize the functions normalize, waste management and contrast from the menu corrected Automatic correction is automatically trying out of your colors to make the best. you will be experimenting with these effects to see which best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">"normalize: this method skaliert the luminous surface of the whole picture, so that the dark point is black and the brightest point as bright as possible without its color shadation. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed."</seg>
<seg id="391">"abbreviations: this method reflects the illuminates of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity can be the same number of pixel. sometimes, the same very good results achieved in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracle in a picture or it destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic compartments: this method maximizes the color area in the red, green and blueprint. it identifies the dark and light border-tones and jushes the red, green and blue-channel channels on the whole histograms."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and the luminosity of the RGB values of an image through the shifting of the lowest and highest values on the widest and highest values in between. this is only visible in full images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white comparison of & digiblown; is a semi-automated tool to carry out the white comparison of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white-hand correction is somewhat limited to a color tree with 8-bit per colour. so if you can perform too far from the original image, in case you can perform the white mode right in the raw mode, which in 16-bit mode, you will get your possibilities for correction better."</seg>
<seg id="396">"this tool is based on a white balance sheet, which is protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it via the menu-entry colour white comparison of image editing."</seg>
<seg id="397">"the pre-showcase can be adjusted to the size. on the left hand, both the original image and preview of the target picture. the preview is dynamically adjusted the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white comparison, then it is enough to click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the destination has a red marker. the pixel of the pixels below this marker will be shown as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"right up there is a histogram indicated that dynamically changed once you have a parameter. this histogrammes is very helpful, even in well illuminated images, most pixels very small luminous values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated. the sum is called Luminia."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadows, satiation and gamma. the shadow of the shadow lets you improve your photos or even down."</seg>
<seg id="401">"Anstat with the above controls can be used, you should use the color temperature Pipette. press on this button and then somewhere on the picture to use the color temperature of the white balance sheet. in this way, the temperature and green -values are also automatically set."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white comparison with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overload indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixels are overexposed.. you will be shown the combined result in the whiteboard. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">"the buttons, and store exactly this. each setting of the white balance which you have set, you can save it into a text file and later load it again."</seg>
<seg id="405">The button preferences set all the filter values again on their standard values and the associated-neutral white balance. notice that even neutral settings will result in a different photo as your original. if you save it will be your original picture.</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can set here the codification per colour channel of the beedited image. 8-bit coding is better for high-quality pictures. this coding requires better for high-quality pictures. this coding requires even more turntable, PNM, TIFF and DNG formats."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw materials. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color-mapping can be carried out by the subwindow for the use of color profiles. a detailled manual for the use of color profiles can be drawn at installments.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool is available in the menu under color sound correction, and allows you to store your settings at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always need the same mistake and you will always need the same correction. in the manual for audio corrections you will find further information."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful option to fix issues is the tool for grassation that you will find under the colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & Present; tool Farbeffers represents you four farms, a solar effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canteen."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, solar power was also called Sabatians, the effect of the picture was created by a partial lightning bolt from the additional light. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors caused by the second illumination. the result was a part of the image. this tool allows you to test this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar power. at approx. 50% intensity shows the image which is chemically possible. another increase will finally generate a negative image that does not generate such a photopier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar-term. the original picture is the (1) and it is processed (2). the intensity is more than 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid Filters simulates the so called & quot; Velviaquot; -Effect. he is distinguished from a saturation that he makes a stronger contrast, which makes the colors brilliant and glazing. try it simply, it embellished many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">"Velvia is the brand name for one in daily light-driven colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvias strongly satisfied colours are however also some photographen, especially those who are barely landscapes."</seg>
<seg id="416">"the neonfilter simulates neonlight to the contrasts. the parameters level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeating the strength of the neonlichts. at large images, the filter can load the entire CPU for one moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras have frequent problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not uncommon that you want to correct the color contrasts and the luminosity of your photos with the tools in the menu under color. all your ligations can be seen in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you are applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you are making a photo with bad light conditions you can get the reverse problem: one to great saturation. even in this case the tool for brightness / saturation will reduce it. all changes that you can perform in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tools Gradation and the simple luminaire / gamma, the tool is sound-correction to improve the exposure. even if dialogue on this tool is very complicated, you need only the range of slider. concrete the three slider below the histograms."</seg>

<seg id="479">& Present; introduces three different tools to watch. each one of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpens is a traditional tool for heating. it is very fast and easy, but produces especially in dark areas, grassy pictures."</seg>
<seg id="481">"inshark mask is working on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharply. indeed, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">"we possibly focus on the best of the three, as he really improved the harp. he is a bit more complicated in his application and has different parameters to adjust."</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus and most of digitalized images require a correction of the sharpness. these elements are smaller than the resolution must be summarised if color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras require usually more detrimental scanding as normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at JPEG pictures, often a camera has been applied internal sharpnessing. pictures in the raw format must always be weakened in while processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner contact the filter filter during the reading of the image. if you disable this deactivate, you will get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the archipelago. you can call the menu entry to the menu item."</seg>
<seg id="487">"but you should hereby deal with caution because the results are not very natural; the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also increases the noise. in general, you can also achieve more information about the menu item refocusing on you. under refocus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little soft, it is much easier than it sharpens. use the tool for softwarter with the menu navigation column on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help the image process. the preshowcase is showing the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values are often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount will reinforce the effect. if you create the insharper mask, smoking and the impression of graten in the proximity of sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius poses one how many pixels are hit on each side of a channel through the filter. high resolution images allow larger images. they therefore should show pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blamed image one that is added to the original. this makes the strength of the harp.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swelling will be a break from the maximum of RGB value and the difference difference. you can thus define a minimum difference between the tones of sharpness and therefore beauty errors in faces, needles and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred masking filter. the original picture is the (1) and the edited image the (2). blurred masking was used with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0. "</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitization; tool focused on stimulates a picture by improving the harp. it used the copyrighted and algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to create a picture & quot; refocused on this. this is better approach than just trying to blur the photo. it makes use of a technique called FIR Wiener Filters. you can usually see better results than blurred masking. you can start it out of the menu by watching colors refocusing on image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice the circular flow is working much better than the Gauß'sche Faltung. the Gauß'sche Faltung has a very long tail, which also depends far from the source pixel, which is far influenced by the original pixel. the FIR Wiener inverse is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixel. the causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular loop: this is the main parameter for the use of this module. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. you can set a higher value if your image is very blurred then but in Heiligenstadt.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in the correlation can help artefacts. the correlation can be chosen by 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1, & eg; 0.95 and value. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"Rauschfilter: an increase in the smoking filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 only rarely helpful. if the smokfilter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a usable value is 0,03. a high value will continue the image further."</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß'S Schärfe: this is the radius of the Gauß'sche Schärfe. use this parameter if your insharpened filter is caused. in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid incomparative artefacts. if you use a value unequal zero so you might also have to increase the correlation and / oderfilter filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">"mattress size: this value determines the size of the transformation method. an increase in the size of the transformation size can produce good results, especially if you choose great values for the circular shaft or the palate's sharpness. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">"the save as and loading buttons are used just for this purpose. any any reflective parameters that you have set will be saved for later, and can then be loaded."</seg>
<seg id="505">"try all the cuts, color and intensity corrections on the picture before you use the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later left uncomfortable artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you are reading images and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, blurred masks better results than sharpens. this could be caused by the blurred masking a larger neighborhood as sharpens."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, blurred do not have to create artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the insharper filter. practically, the result of the FIR Wiener Filters is always at least as good as the insharper mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better at editing small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused picture:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture has to be corrected. this picture was done with a analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the Auto-focus Linse.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information about the methods of scattering, you can read a technical comparison of English using this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The controller smoothens the insistence of the partitions of the abominator to create a natural pile.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the colour tinent allows a adapted colour for the pile. if you want a blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image correction is one of the most widely developed tools in order to not remove the desired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Equality algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg Project.</seg>
<seg id="517">"this tool contains various benefits as starting points, to simplify the restoration. the available preference settings are listed below:"</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to choose the filter settings for a justion, you can also use the rider smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detailing p [0, 100]: this is the preservation of details. a small value leads to a consistent smoothest over the image. on the basis of higher values depends mainly by homogeneous regions and details. please note that the details will always be subordinated and should be subordinated."</seg>
<seg id="520">"dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while having a value close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film gritt or create a high value corrugated patterns. JPEG artefacts are best eliminated with a value close to 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. then set the relative smoothing. therefore put this value to the degree of smoking in your picture."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter is bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is prescribed, as it is difficult to generate geometry of the picture. even if you want to produce a 'van Gogh' Turbullets, it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Reps: indicates how often the algorithm is running. usually it is possible 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle-span da [5, 90]: wind dependent integration of anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha is small, it should also be small. so you should select this value as a size and acceptable to your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrale pedals [0.1, 10]: integrals step in pixel. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never bigger than 2. "</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the more quality that you receive from the option of this option is only small. but it doubles its duration. we therefore recommend it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">"the buttons, and loading make exactly this. every setting of image errors can be correct in a text file and later loaded again."</seg>
<seg id="528">Image faults correct is comparatively very fast at work. but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load for itself. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button crash.</seg>

<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is needed for filters. large values increase the time of filter per pixel and can expire the picture. the area indicated throughout the picture and the color in it will be adjusted and thus made minor errors."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness of the pixel. this value sets the pixel failures to determine light-resistance. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details do not receive more and smoker or lubricate again."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controlled the canteen for the harp. this value enhances the frequency response. if it's too strong can not be removed the entire noise or smokets can occur. put it on a value close to the maximize if you want to remove a faint smoking or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>

<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend you to change either color or luminance to improve an image. these settings will not affect the smoothing process of which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"Gamma: controls the gammating of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerances of the dark areas, which typically bends more strongly contracted, however, he lubricates the shadow."</seg>
<seg id="541">"shock absorption: controls the alignment of the phasenjittering absorption. this value defines how fast the adaptive filtering is responding to variations of the luminance. if he is lifted to high, the edges and phasenjitter may occur at the edges. he can remove socks and is the recommended method for it."</seg>
<seg id="542">"save and store: these buttons are used precisely for this. all parameters for smokers, which you have set, can be saved into the filesystem and later loaded."</seg>

<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel. if the difference between color values exceeds the pre-determined threshold, then the pixel is split into 4 subpixel, which can be traced separately and to further subordinate. the maximum depth of records can be set by lowering."</seg>

<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= This attitude should usually offer to most people and most of the musical pieces of unacceptable transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. "</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate approximately 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enjoyment for music of young people, portable devices and car stereotypes. but not good enough for better HiFi stereograms."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information provided by manually or by the program automatically from the freeDB over the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. they can be delivered with & kaudiocreator; and the codile program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with codierprograms, there is often a combination of programs for the codification and these parameters. the manual or help to codiers declare the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example to add the & CD; titles to the keyword (English: day), when MP3s are coded with lame, the switches must be added by lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; the result looks so: '... - tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button-drawing in assistants):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which people can download the audio CD, so that all other these information can be downloaded instead of text: & CD; title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I am not a lawyer. however, nobody can prevent you from the & CD; for more or less valuable, so any information cannot be added to the artist or CD; business, physical or virtual."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"in & kaudiocreator; is actively used to choose a cross-box (sending an address). for the use of freeDB can not be used with another (counterfeit) address, but in this type of configuration, it appears, the e-mail address may not be used when retrieve the data from the server (This is only the programmer who has checked the code.)"</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; for use of freeDB, the geografic should be used on the next lying mirror server. this saves bandwidth on the network and resembles the load between the machines."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a list of mirrors for the online call of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which readout program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumors that this cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see for sure that the cdparanoia package has to be installed at first, if this has not yet happened."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"for storing the WAV files, the codification and thus the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening you are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a noncommitting for audio data) on the tab for the setup of the Kodierers. other coders can be added on this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the codification can be used. this is also necessary for the predefined codierer. for more information on codierer are in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a Kodiers, further information on his switch can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a consoles window (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed codiers."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this may have many causes. check out the device drawing of the & CD; / DVD disk, the desidery and readers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;). try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give a reference to what is wrong."</seg>

<seg id="1543">"have you read the complete manual, all understood, but are somehow still unsafe what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-step example, and you will get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want."</seg>
<seg id="1544">"in this example we will launch the program for the first time, setup everything and our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to create MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keyword (tags)."</seg>

<seg id="1550">"although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not change it in any way of reading a & CD; change when once the matching settings are found."</seg>

<seg id="1652">"this is absolutely necessary for synthesizer, which are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case the MIDI-Map General-MIDI-events occur in events that understands the synthesizer."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"for example, you can create a MIDI map that changes all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and therefore always a trumpet ring when originally a piano should play."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"if you only have a sound card, you do not need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -compatible (including Awe - and CIS -maps, FM-devices and so on)."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI-maps. so you have to edit the appropriate file of hand (with your favorite editor)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file that saves all necessary realizations for the play of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">"each section may only appear, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. the requirement for this is, however, that every appearance has a different text id (see below)."</seg>

<seg id="1661">In this section is stated as the patches of general MIDI of your specific keyboard can be formed. the general use is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equation can be ignored. it is assumed that the GM -patches are in the right sequence (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optionale All KeysTo M is needed to place all sounds, which support this tool for example (GM-patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60) that is similar to a gun. do you wear the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (Win), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here is the term Trouble-patch of the patch, in which every sound is a different percussional strument (drum, pelvis, Maracas & etc;) and not the one where the tone means the tone height of the always the same drum (as it did some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">KEYMAP section is needed to indicate how notes on a specific channel or instrument can be pictured.</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with PATCHMAP's section, the order of the lines is very important, as well as its availability. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define for each channel and each instrument multiple keymaps. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to form tones on the perch channel. take a look at the suitable keychain.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to form some channels to others. if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel, you simply make it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (general MIDI channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi-Devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered between 0 and 15, built according to the following patterns:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"N is the channel, which is used on the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap will need to use the name for this channel. if you use the Forcepatch option, all events will be ignored on this channel. in this case, the patch will be used at this canal."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The option ForcePatch can be useful for example to always use the perch patch on the perch channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderratio indicates, in which ratio Pitch-Bender events can be multiplied with the value n, this with the formula n * (r / 4096) is calculated and then only passed on. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file is not decimalkommas)."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting will be used because GM will give you a keyboard, which is a pitch-bending event with the value 4096, to play a tone higher. unfortunately, however, try some keyboards to play two notes up to an octave higher. to try the right value on your keyboard, you must try a bit with & kmid;"</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-map just open the dialog MIDI settings. you can find in the menu under settings, point MIDI-settings "</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canalview is a window with a whole bunch of pianos (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos you see which sounds just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a selection list where you have changed a tool. if you have changed a tool, the button lights no longer green but red, to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The canalview has (until now) two different views available to view the sounds. the view will choose settings under the Point Kanalview: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed-LCD shows the speed in which a song will be played, the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the pace of a song, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right from the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, and etc.. this allows the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians play the same notes in a very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"good, I can force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file 4 MB needs (a compressive relationship of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed and etc. you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have compiled a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without Awe support you need to download a source distribution and install (for example by kmid;" s Home) "</seg>

<seg id="2082">"in & quantaplus; is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;"</seg>
<seg id="2083">"global elements are available for each one, the & quantaploos; use, available. from toolboxes to actions it is, in common folder structure of & quantaplus; saved. this enables the group of administrators to secure toolboxes, actions and patterns in the global tree, which can then be available each in a multi-user environment at the system."</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolboxes. local items are stored in user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; -patterns to workboxes with special actions specifically for the files of a certain project. simply said, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folders and patterns of all staff within the project."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"the & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editors window, the construction views, the cartons with information and the toolboxes. please hit, and for further information about these areas."</seg>
<seg id="2087">"one can click the boxes with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current documentation, like close the current, other or all cartels, re-loading, delete or uploading of the document, jump to a bookmark or version of CVS commands to the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2088">"right-click in the editors lead to another context menu regarding the edited document contents, such as basic processing steps (cutting / copy / paste), editing of the mouse below the mouse cursor, or opening the file, if the string is called below the mouse-cursor one file."</seg>
<seg id="2089">"at the top of the Editors, the toolbar of the editors are at present & breakfasts; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of toolboxes are shown. in the course of further construction of workboxes, the toolbar will be adapted to the new functions and that connected to the user needs."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the use of toolbar is really easy. if they want to insert an easy day, for example & lt; pgt; in your document, then click on the icon that has written several attributes (like Anker), you can fill in a dialog different fields."</seg>

<seg id="2092">"project management is a powerful tool, the & quantaploos. this view shows all the files in the project and allows the administration of the files in the project by means of right mouse click. actions such as Hinding, removal, uploading or deleting the files from storage medium can then be performed using the context menu."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"another way of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. there are all options open for you."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"templates can be divided into three categories depending on which connection they are used. global templates are always available, local templates only available for the corresponding user and templates in projects are available only in the project. more about templates is available."</seg>

<seg id="2096">"with this view one displays the internal structure of the active document. through links to a module, the cursor is set to the position of the element. due to the right click of an element, a list of commands opens up in terms of navigation and refresher of the tree."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"this tree appears among the other construction views. with it, manders and namespace can change. it allows the content of all available attributes with a few clicks."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"here is the complete documentation for the web-technology for your development. it can be downloaded pre-packed documentation for & quantaploos; you can create own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be added and considered."</seg>

<seg id="2287">"also 3-way together is fully supported. this is useful when two persons operate independently of each other at a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps the dissolve result of conflicts and shows simultaneously the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three Quell files when combined:"</seg>

<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init is also different from the BSD init, that the configuration files in a subfolder / etc are located directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following further folder:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service that you want to start by the system or changing to another Runlevel. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things such as setters, which only once started. such views belong to rc.local. "</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in its turn under / etc / rc.d you need it. most systems possess this file even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also leave a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to carry out something that has to do with the seriding connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks at different places after the program init and starts the first he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is registered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the pre-set Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can fix it and execute the 3. be very careful when you start your system reboot the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you will probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder do not find correct files. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d. "</seg>
<seg id="2968">"how does it start and stops init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is so written, that it is an argument like start and stop accepted. you can now start this scripts in fact from hand on the command line:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would hold the httpd Server. init reads the name, and when the one K contains, the script will be called with the argument stop. if he includes a S, the script will start with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people wish to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server-running level, that leaves just httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. moreover, I could also have a user -Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv. you should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not say trivial: drag an entry from the field of Available system services on one of the six Runway to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you may change scripts, move between Runleveling or change the position within a level by removing it elsewhere. this will only happen if they draw an entry from the field of the Available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved, if you choose them in a new area. to select them merely on a new Runlevel, you need to expressly select from the menu editing or from the context menu and even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated, in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries, before you can again try to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: at present, there is no possibility to restore entries that have been thrown into the trash. be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator button to activate the different operations (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor buttons to make a range of above or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another Runlevel, move it by cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired Runlevel with inserting (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of an application manually, press the key button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by writing the button button to change the changes, or push Esc to change the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data transfer, all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are taken from the Global File ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise they will be saved by & ksysv; restored changes to preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard-Runleveling and now the machine starts resistant to new ones. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the entry button to start in the single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and modify the default Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine)."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; provided for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE, or Delix (DLD), you must edit additional files in / etc that are only present in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way, such as system services are started in these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; are planning an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use a different distribution: check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the relevant system service (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) will simply end without notice, if their configuration files are not present or wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the importance of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use a different distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to start with & kuser; it is adequate, the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you have made changes, you must save it. either use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or the entry storing in the menu file."</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two cardboard cards, the user and user interface. to the editing you choose the desired user or the desired group with a double-clicking on the entry. it appears the dialog's or group properties. "</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some cardboard cards are shown only if you have enhanced system settings. only when you have enhanced system settings. only if you are able to make individual settings, if shadow's passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD-Unices are installed."</seg>
<seg id="2994">"the card-card Password administration appears, in case of shadow's passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD-Unices are installed."</seg>
<seg id="2995">"this card-card will appear only if for at least a specified file system (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable on the file quota.user / quota.group on the filesystem). here you can change parameters for each user, with the limited data are available in KB:"</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be adjusted individually for each filesystem. the current file system is selected with the help of the field filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"card-card groups informs about the group members of the selected user. the standard group, which the user belongs, can be found in the primous group. furthermore the user can mark the user in other groups by marking them in the big box."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"the dialog features of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list."</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group to add an add from the menu user or group or click the matching Add-button of the toolbar. the editing or deleting the selected user and the selected group will be analog.</seg>
<seg id="3000">"with this module you can install the LILO-BootManager, remove and modify the time up to the boats of the standard operating system, remove the standard operating system, remove, change operating systems, change, change and more."</seg>
