&quot; although I visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love of America is extremely great .
&quot; as many of my generation I have grown up with American films , made American authors read and run his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly journalist because of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gr@@ ay Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , who covered with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ ate the mur@@ der@@ ous conspir@@ acy of a oil @-@ magn@@ ates , who were su@@ sten@@ ed his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; me , as if the absolute truth is , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year that I lived in Arizona , had only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the USA only . &quot;
&quot; I said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the way you are , and it &apos;s easy acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I had even written a very warmer love letter about his size .
then came Donald Tru@@ mp .
much was written on the xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me as he goes with his bott@@ ling .
&quot; he never stops behind the mountain , as it says so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , like a former colleague put it , and openly declared his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted in Sch@@ aren for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million voices that he won in the Republi@@ can presidential elections , was the highest number , which was ever raised by the party nomin@@ ee . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ otte person and asked me ?
I could not reconc@@ ile Tru@@ mp and his voters don &apos;t have met with the people I met in Phoenix for my time .
&quot; as for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journalist program , people from all over the world raise , a deep sti@@ cking person with which I could talk about Islam and its past . &quot;
&quot; the Tru@@ mp@@ s World gives not coinci@@ de with the Peter Bh@@ atia , the present editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ atia and I met with our common love for basketball , and we spent many hours with it to watch the &quot; Phoenix Suns &quot; in the game . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s Int@@ oler@@ ance stands also in contrast to gener@@ osity that I lived in Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought for her life for the environment and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me as their son . &quot;
it fits them with the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es which always helped with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of the American life .
&quot; then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice has helped me a lot to my career . &quot;
these people and those with them em@@ bo@@ died values deep@@ ened my love of America .
&quot; while the Tru@@ mp &apos;s path to the nomin@@ ee Republi@@ can presidential data , they offered me a grip and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America . &quot;
however it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp , because they either shared racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to over@@ look these things , broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp @-@ voters as a r@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; to arrange people , said one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ respectful , and indicates a in@@ capacity to understand those who act in a different way and think . &quot;
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the h@@ ectic changes in their churches will not be considered .
&quot; could it be that these voters have been tuned for Tru@@ mp , because they want to re @-@ win control of a country that has disappointed me ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they may perhaps say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who sees the cruel decision to raise a man who look down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; ( m . B. SC . : as much as &quot; runs of white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities , &quot; play as much as sh@@ iny on the wh@@ ites and wh@@ i@@ pl@@ ash as it was the great Van Jones , exactly the killed what America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate American ideal - regardless of whether the myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you like , America is definitely welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ rian , whose story , as he says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; however , with the election Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back on Ru@@ der , say they say . &quot;
&quot; in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
on a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would have my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a lau@@ t@@ strong &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; brood the crowd .
&quot; have Latin America a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; rep@@ lied . &quot;
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they called them and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; if someone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and powerful &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan closed with the words : &quot; &quot; God was thanks , Mr. Tru@@ mp , is that not your America . &quot; &quot; 36 hours later it was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the country , for which his son was , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tru@@ mp@@ s Land , the message said . &quot;
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America .
and this is breaking me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school in the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean town of Cat@@ eur@@ a ?
&quot; that the music that is played on both places , not only the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a great gar@@ bage dump , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an old colonial city which is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen . &quot;
&quot; for some years now , La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( musi@@ ban@@ de ) has now been playing in the municipality : one of children and adults with an independent Symphony Orchestra , which has found an opportunity to overcome the surrounding poverty . &quot;
a music @-@ school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs mis@@ use and the gangs . &quot;
&quot; however , this changed after a random encounter with a French pil@@ ots who started a musical project and the youth took such a rare hope . &quot;
the young band@@ members take their commitments towards the music group very seriously and means local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi :
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they walk back home and immediately after lunch they run by the du@@ sting roads to meet her great passion . &quot;
&quot; you always come l@@ laugh@@ ing and play with sh@@ iny eyes and play in the tru@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clar@@ inet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , B@@ ong@@ os and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village , which is practically up on the biggest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay , capital , which are produced from re@@ produced waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with recovered instruments produced from local solid waste material , made in a workshop for music instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the Rec@@ ycl@@ er started under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez in order to transform parts of the fall into instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ i@@ ously viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cor@@ elli , double @-@ bass , guit@@ ars , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , trumpet , tromb@@ ones and perc@@ ussion that were all produced from the rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in Los Angeles , F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez , a local ec@@ ologist and Musi@@ cians of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , to the beginning of the beginning : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult , because we had no place to rehear@@ se , and we had to teach in the same place where the parents knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them don &apos;t live with their children . &quot;
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : one of waste has been made from waste .
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments from re@@ produced material and called The Rec@@ ycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) draws the musical performance at :
the world creates roughly one billion tons of tr@@ ash every year .
&quot; those who live with him and live from him are the poorest - like the people in Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here she turns him into something beautiful .
land@@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ational swing from rub@@ b@@ ish @-@ music around the world .
the Orchestra has played his music in front of the Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and teamwork can be able to fight against illegal fishing industry
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild is fought against illegal fishing .
&quot; this article , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , published a magazine that targeted on international , practical solutions for environmental issues . &quot;
the republi@@ cation happens as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices on shared usage of content .
&quot; in West Africa it was then known that this ship was already operated in liber@@ ated waters illegal fishing , before it sought the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were brought about accordingly and little con@@ stric@@ ted to welcome an legislative bre@@ cher of this type on its shores .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the com@@ ers , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles mobil@@ ised themselves swi@@ f@@ tly against the ship . they ling@@ ered to him , one of their har@@ bours , and refuse to give him a fishing permits . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Ur@@ suddenly was the prime minister surrounded by countries that simply refuse anything , &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , an introduc@@ tory employee of the Ken@@ yan Fisher@@ ies . he is part of a team that discovered the ship over time and followed . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch up there fish . &quot;
&quot; finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia , due to pill@@ age of the fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , criminal practices crossed and resources was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Ill@@ egal F@@ ishing ( Ill@@ egal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries , which at that time the prime minister had driven out of their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; with this we have eight countries , which are like @-@ minded and working together . they exchange information and stand up each other where it is about illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Ill@@ egal F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is captured is hidden that it is extremely difficult to absor@@ b . thus the illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing regions .
&quot; by inten@@ tional cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , by which certain habitats and types are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems can harm to have a delicate equilibrium . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once han@@ dic@@ apped by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ dles and also through the sn@@ ail , with the information between individual countries , the actions occur today in real time , with trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; here the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspected activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of vessels also very attentive , if they move on the open sea with satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to mark the authorities , ships that fish in the bot@@ tom@@ ed areas . also , so suspic@@ ious driving tests will discover that a ship was given his fish out on other ships on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the ideal case , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license , where they have been on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal record . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing , can then refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports . what does the ships could not sell their charge . and that they can even be forced to the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; then it is a considerable financial loss for the owner , meaning that the illegal fishing fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , General Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and thereby also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the platform mentioned above was created to re @-@ estimated 20 million USD in lost sales , which lose eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year due to the illegal fishermen that penet@@ rate into East African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una @-@ fish @-@ fish because of the region &apos;s commercial fishing from around the world . among these also these illegal fishermen .
&quot; their practices include such practices , such as the sailing under fal@@ sely flag , f@@ ake license deposits , indication of f@@ antasi@@ es , the fishing protected species and the fish in nature conservation areas . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a not fully organized control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; sooner , a ship could be illegal fishing and a country could then say &quot; You dar@@ st not running my harbour . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; com@@ m to me &apos; . &apos; and exactly this legal sl@@ ugs is temp@@ ted to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations of susp@@ ects ships .
&quot; it has un@@ covered criminal networks , which had been distributed by counter@@ f@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that pursu@@ es several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has escaped ships . &quot;
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ POL , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing and vast distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our studies lead us rather far into the organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; it builds a system that is intended to help F@@ ISH @-@ i , compar@@ ative ships conc@@ ise . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly further developed , also helps to hide illegal ships who are happy to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g Mat Tr@@ acking , an NGO , which also deals with fisheries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships turn up for example its automatic identi@@ fier systems , with which they cannot become more of satellites . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects different information levels , it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find crimin@@ al ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team African nations actually influence this undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened together with Google and the Marine Sea Organization Oc@@ e@@ ana . the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch opens : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed around the world by means of each individual trac@@ eable ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; join forces with the neighbors to get a better picture of what is doing - that &apos;s just meaning &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to combine and combine their resources for the examination . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run , where a global system the persecution of vessels permits . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only sense crimin@@ als , but also sc@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; ships used earlier without a license and hardly had to reck@@ on with consequences , they now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating at F@@ ISH @-@ i participating countries have now to buy a 33 % increase of fisheries revenue , since then fishing boats more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia , Gre@@ ko 1 helped him , Gre@@ ko 1 found the in@@ spec@@ s there on board tow , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries are notic@@ ing these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that now also other countries &quot; , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study objective . &quot; &quot; in West Africa each year disappear several hundred million dollars by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 six countries have joined together six countries , for so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . now they are fighting the illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With security is the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest affiliate in Somalia could report its first big triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the wrong flag . and not only the ship was used without a license and were used sl@@ ug@@ g@@ e which is now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into ban waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 put them a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative way of protecting the oceans actually works throughout the world sea .

&quot; your articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continue to spread further : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of taking back the country &quot;
the road moving in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the ministers of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela has rejected the amendment of the opposition to a referendum on ministers , re@@ acted the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations have gathered about the political and economic crisis of the country into the void of the streets . &quot;
under the has@@ ht@@ ag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( e.g. : the back@@ casting of Venezuela ) can be found both images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among other things in the flat area of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes @-@ regions of MÃ©@@ rida and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , located in the central @-@ north of the Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and Isla Margar@@ ita in the State of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country is deterior@@ ating continually , which makes itself noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans through an acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition looked at the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; however , ultimately the de@@ fi@@ denti@@ ality of a re @-@ election of the official authorities was blocked . &quot;
&quot; Marianne D@@ Ã­@@ az , contribut@@ ors to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ized in their latest articles the context of the government of government : &quot;
&quot; in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and tissues formed to the highest around the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % of the annual financial transaction ) , and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine was considered the only way to conquer its institutional structures and close a new government . &quot;
&quot; the electoral campaign M@@ esa de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( e.g. : r@@ ammed table of the Democratic entity ) , in which the opposition to the president of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro &apos; was initiated in the following day of representatives from representatives of the opposition . here , the trial against President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro &apos; was scheduled to continue on November 3 , should continue to continue the rec@@ tum of the referendum on November 3 . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :

&quot; on Twitter , pictures used by disputes , as well as reports of repression and abuse . &quot;
&quot; especially large waves , the news suggested over police repression in the central city of Marac@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; there , the prot@@ esters moved back to the local Cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advocates of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went further . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country some prot@@ esters tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the Andes @-@ state T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira bear no redness , because one could see something else , what many nation@@ gar@@ th@@ ers do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an Info@@ graphic is already making the round the scale of repression per day : &quot;
so the dictatorship has suppres@@ sed the land .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an am@@ nest@@ ing process - this has now been proven in the eyes of many thanks to the presence of an un@@ countable number of people .

the interview was translated into English and will be published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city CÃ³rdoba . &quot;
&quot; by now an adult man said Qui@@ j@@ ano , as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ ber@@ a process in the province of CÃ³rdoba , against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the process , which ended on August 24th 2016 , crimes were investigated during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; starting with the brush , the same name as his father to carry up to the brutal military operations in prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough . &quot;
&quot; 34 years , he beh@@ aved the family ger@@ m for himself . &quot;
in the situation at that time I believed that was fine .
I felt like a wal@@ k@@ ent .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that man is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; I was not able to realize that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ be@@ am@@ ter . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship of 1974 to 1983 , a time of state @-@ resistance 141 in the prison of La Per@@ la . &quot;

&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went with us to the sports hall . there I was rounded with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
all sc@@ anned him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are a Ar@@ sch@@ loch you gave you with one of the ERP .
pass only on that she does not cause you a day and I must save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ cion@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo - Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Labour Party in Argentina .
therefore he offered me to go back to the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; he said to me , I would be heard . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok . for so my father had educated me .
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy papers which had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , prop@@ ag@@ and@@ amat@@ erial , books , simply all . &quot;

&apos;@@ There the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
during the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he command@@ ed me to asc@@ end . he led me to a bar@@ bed , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - simply anything possible - were . &quot;
all of it was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little into a ceiling wrapped and command@@ ed me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver . &quot;
on that day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke where the stolen items were ab@@ sent and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open area and said :
there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; I cri@@ ed in , and saw a goat on which people were tor@@ tured . &quot;
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found that they attach it to an end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person that was just being captiv@@ ated .
&quot; she captiv@@ ates a man with palms to the bed , over@@ shot him with water and h@@ unted him a charge of 220 Volt to the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the Gest@@ ank there in it was f@@ oul ... like a narrow win@@ dle .
&quot; later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do so much sor@@ row ?
&quot; I knew that these people were killed &quot;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with pil@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the trial ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of mat@@ tresses that were naked with the face down - everyone was captiv@@ ated in hands and feet .
near the entrance number of people quietly on the mat@@ tresses .
&quot; and my father noticed that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ est thou so , Ar@@ sch@@ loch ? &quot;
&quot; I thought , Why did you get rid of me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my father told home about it .
&quot; in addition to La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there has a man mer@@ ged and killed .
&quot; ( according to the survi@@ vor@@ s of the civil war Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged at La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a trial , the University of Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia leads to Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , Head of the memorial La Per@@ la , by the former Fol@@ der chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way you came in here is also the way , on which the kidn@@ apped came here . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the map , you see that they took about the way and then were tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names have changed and they were assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization one number assigned .
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War &apos; War &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things from home .
&quot; at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; - how it was called it . &quot;
&quot; but when I was later in the military , I was in the g@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - was clear to me that war pre@@ y was a B@@ aj@@ on@@ ett , or perhaps military signs which you fight against one enemy . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ table , clothing , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then that is not a war@@ ring but Vand@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always asked me how my father , the head of security forces , I could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I simply do not understand it .
I was also officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never really like to enter into a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father was doing this .
&quot; once he called me a crime and I rep@@ lied , and thou that thou sh@@ ou@@ st the cars on the street ? &quot;
you are not a crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded before anger , struck me and cri@@ ed : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and teach you too . &quot;
we need no one else !
so my father was .
I have no one good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then on which I carried a jack@@ et and a sco@@ oter swe@@ ater from w@@ ool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
we were not poor but he still brought clothing to home .
&quot; then he accused me the defense , a toge@@ ther@@ er in this crime . I ref@@ uted no problem , they can lay me to the burden what they wanted . &quot;
I was anyway there to di@@ ct .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I find rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot;
I have children . if you have children first one recogni@@ zes the value of one life .
one develops further and recognis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you did so during the dictatorship of humans . but why the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children are kidn@@ apped ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with his house , whose mother was killed . &quot;
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked me the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could just have been put into prison .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but what their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
did these people not also have families whom you were handed over to the rem@@ n@@ ants ?
the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act that one can do to man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was introduced again , they hol@@ ten machines to eliminate the rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were de@@ pressed and somewhere escaped - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you will never find something , &quot; &quot; said my Father . &quot;
but something remains always .
I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I even stayed in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
&quot; the thought to show my father , was born during a conversation , when he stood under house arrest . &quot;
&quot; I made him pre@@ di@@ ct because of all the atro@@ cities , which I had to experience . &quot;
&quot; then he said suddenly , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have no one killed . &quot;
&quot; I felt inspired and asked me when the whole survi@@ ving patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; western and Christian feelings &quot; , &quot; which they alleg@@ edly defended . &quot;
then I cri@@ ed :
how can you tell me what to tell me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me to participate as a child .
&quot; he res@@ ists only &quot; &quot; Well , then sent me to . &quot;
that is exactly what I did .
2010 re@@ imb@@ urs@@ ed the first ad .
at last I had finally recognised that he was a criminal .
&quot; nobody can blame me , that I am taken . I finally said against my own father . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest even before the end of the trial .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; terrible auto@@ drivers &quot;

editing of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend its lead @-@ licence , in the last month witnesses of a very mis@@ fortune translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign , the Japanese word &quot; &quot; belt &quot; &quot; was published , the &quot; mature motor@@ cyclists &quot; means , mis@@ diagnosed - maybe even with mal@@ icious back@@ wards &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; as &quot; terrible driving @-@ driver &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the false translation was to be found in electronic advertisements from 1st to 20 September in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine that has often been dealt with in social media .
&quot; the bug was the transl@@ ator Julian Hol@@ mes , one of the inhabitants of Ky@@ otos . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the Kyoto newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto . &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the name &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate if also gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the pre@@ fecture of Kyoto ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , they said that the bug has already been included in the text they had been checked by transl@@ ators and that the translation was not tested on its accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blog@@ ger reported as follows on the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are sincerely sincere that older people felt by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; &quot; said the Police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ cast News set something more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; was den@@ o@@ unced as an in@@ appropriate description of older auto@@ drivers . according to the police , the share of older motor@@ ists are involved in accidents , but quite reason to worry . &quot;
in the pre@@ fecture of Kyoto for example were caused in 2005 1.@@ 9@@ 41 from a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents of seniors . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % .
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , caused seniors 1.@@ 8@@ 03 from a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
this makes her share of 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents decreased in total , the proportion of seniors caused by seniors in the same period has risen . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ por@@ ter were previously mentioned Repor@@ ter , in the Yahoo announced version of the article comments to the Light , which demonstrate that prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seems to appear against older drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo on the translation errors was given the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; ) about not the reality ?
&quot; - &quot; So fails , the translation is not at all , or ? &quot;
I don &apos;t find that this is a real translation mistake .
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gra@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in all Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and all Asia .
the website En@@ gra@@ ish@@ .com is a true discovery for these bar@@ ren mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
&quot; to over@@ turn , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the output text and to transfer active language skills to transfer him into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active rule of the target language - something that is the case in native speakers . generally , the conviction that transl@@ ators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native language . &quot;
&quot; thus , one of French translation should be translated from English to French - not from French into English . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ Users Karl Bar@@ on .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as mother@@ tongue , the translations into English . this may be due to def@@ ective understanding of the surplus , reasons , or the relatively small number of English speakers that learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies that even do not have foreign employees , translations are nevertheless company @-@ internally . then the Japanese employees , whose English knowledge is considered to be the best one , to transl@@ ators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ Users Karl Bar@@ on .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the wor@@ r@@ alled and pu@@ zz@@ ling propositions emerge by machine translation , demonstrate that this technique can still not replace a human transl@@ ator for a long time . this applies to several languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic prints , which often uses T @-@ shirts or bags are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood not at all . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ Users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors , as jewelry nor acceptable or at least inno@@ cu@@ ous . however , by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
the city Kyoto uses a serious source for its translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and customs policies on the internet and TV to take
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Adventure ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning , April 7 , announces ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ an internet , that they would have no access to the Online Sender Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet pres@@ ences of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV could no longer be accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online transm@@ itter over@@ run recordings of the protests in Car@@ acas , organized by sacrific@@ ed groups that oppose the government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Ma@@ du@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests started at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court had dis@@ solved the Parliament and transferred the tasks of the Parliament on the executive and the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection ch@@ opped off , and received the U@@ tilities , VP@@ N ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet . &quot;

it seems that Internet sites of ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ an Provider are again locked .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media has been involved in reporting about protests in 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Tel@@ ecommunic@@ ation spoke to them with monetary policy and closing , if they continue to report about demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as &quot; call to violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV , and informative national television channels I registered with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot;
amazing that this is still cheaper than two lit@@ res of Lim@@ on@@ ade to buy .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay by a block of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) in@@ accessible , but also two more online radio stations . this also affects the website , on which the National Assembly carries its meetings . &quot;
&quot; previous research inquiries made by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , revealed that the local internet provider to stay DNS . this is a technique that fail@@ ures the DNS server requests from certain domains . &quot;
&quot; when a web page is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds or denied the request when calling such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS sper@@ re : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; with V@@ PI@@ TV , a third donated channel , the transmission was set on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es was transferred to the protests in Car@@ acas . &quot;
Flor@@ es was be@@ aten while he was at a police force .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on to show . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it is also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : thus the Venezu@@ el@@ ans becomes increasingly difficult to access to multi @-@ media coverage on current events in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls will get into slave to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was a cri@@ m@@ ita as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and coll@@ ects witness to other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , who became exactly how they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the shorten@@ ed version of a report published by Kur@@ dish , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series featuring the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que and &quot; ( &quot; flying cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , which is edited and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga lived eight years in a household , in which she was not willing to eat together with the family who was able to eat there . &quot;
shortly before their degree graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was filled with pride about her . she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; which , from which something has become &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ enga has never been treated like a daughter in this cottage .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as a Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , one refers to the more than 46.@@ 000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money over@@ prints their min@@ der@@ old son or her under@@ age daughter to another , plentiful family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; but what is not mentioned however , is that children can afford to do countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victim of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract you cannot raise . &quot;
this as a cri@@ m@@ az@@ go practi@@ sed practice is widely used in Paraguay due to the involvement and acceptance of large parts of society and in spite of numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ enga worked for several years for an organisation that fights for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she talked with cri@@ p@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered be@@ ers , resear@@ ched and p@@ ran@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things in the name , as the feeling of gratitude that will be vacc@@ inated the cri@@ mp @-@ itas , guarantees in general breast @-@ silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double del@@ usion , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family who complete her daughter in faith , that they will take care of their training in society and can make something out of himself , to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family , which takes the girl with himself and whose exploitation con@@ cludes with faith , that they would give someone another chance that would otherwise no training would be given and maybe even star@@ ert . &quot;
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; if the girl gets mis@@ used , his family will experience many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 the so far relatively unknown phenomenon known in the dark in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen household , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº came to hospital , her body showed traces of fier@@ ce blo@@ ws . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was cri@@ m@@ ita in the household of the former Mil@@ kal@@ ine@@ ate Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as official officials in the population .
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants , 250 kilometres east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira struck long as with a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n , until they suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the mur@@ dered child was a cri@@ m@@ ita .
organisations like UNIC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made deep responsibility for the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice for the death of the girl .
they signed the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as a &quot; modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest and called for no further Carolina to be in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos have been widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows registered as children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbors of a couple and almost 60 civil society organizations called for a serious investigation into the case .
&quot; they want the Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl , which was their Cri@@ ad@@ ita to 30 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be definitive for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
&quot; Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only exploited as labour forces , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was ten years old when the Far@@ mers , who worked her father and lost her father . &quot;
your brothers now had to work all and began to sell on the road or on the market of sweets to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of her employers Al@@ var@@ enga worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to share the time so that you still have time to learn .
she stood up at five o &apos;clock in the morning and prepared breakfast for their employers .
&quot; for example , they puri@@ fied the fridge , p@@ utz@@ ed the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the ground . &quot;
when the school was at the end she went back home and had time to learn .
&quot; the more they finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
&quot; but even this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their employers . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ var@@ enga says , she never had to go hungry , but did not let me get more books from the library of the land@@ lady as eating out of the refrigerator , &quot; she reminds me . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the land@@ lady , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some evenings of the house@@ er@@ r Al@@ var@@ enga , next to him and guidance from Op@@ position@@ ings like &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he tried to convince her , to persu@@ ade the reports of the official media on the regime of the dict@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; he held her for intelligent , but did not think with her . &quot; the landlord had found someone who spoke when he sp@@ ake about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; she allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would learn there again &quot; poor habit . &quot; so they meant that Al@@ var@@ enga heard that the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ would speak at home again their native language Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ . &quot;
&quot; your Lord feared that they had the formation they had enabled them , he explains . &quot;
&quot; but it was completely clear that they had given them for everything they had paid by them , with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; also in school , Al@@ var@@ enga had been discrimin@@ ated . &quot; a thing about which almost never spoken , are Mob@@ bing and the chic@@ ks , those Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed if they go to school . &quot;

&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can point for cleaning personnel and children in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the administration in the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a sightseeing in the district of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n . &quot;
hello ! I am looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
to learn .
please speak to you .
&quot; beginning from Monday , if possible . &quot;
the ad got five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and a lot of comments .
a woman from the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have a rock @-@ year girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered their 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; a girl from the inland region &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Set the fi@@ bers of the ad once again :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I see if it works with it . &quot;
&quot; thanks , I write again , when something is . &quot;
the business was completed .
in the Pro@@ log to the report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , Â¿ H@@ asta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long still ? ) , a collection of witness , former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history we managed to create systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( an practice from the early history of Paraguay that the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores , the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores , the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores , the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores , had to go into a system of slavery , with which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation . &quot;
social inequality in Paraguay and the vision of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
legislative acts writes Egyptian users social media to register with the government

sixty Egyptian parliamentary committees have recently agreed to a bill &apos;s regulations regarding the use and use of social networks .
&quot; if it is accepted by the Parliament , users and users have to register social media in Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law a place would then be set up , which is responsible for allowing citizens to give permission to place social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with acceptance of the law , users would have to register to users and users on the site of the site with their proper names and recruitment numbers to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do this , this could bring a penalty up to six months in prison or a money . &quot;
&quot; the bill introduced out of six plots and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent Kur@@ ens@@ ored , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , vide@@ on@@ ach@@ ers and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is en@@ forced when the draft is no indication of how an Egyptian authorities should be imposed on users and users who are not able to register , in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to guarantee regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdu@@ l Satt@@ ler , parliament@@ arians and Pat@@ rons of the Legisl@@ ative Council , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user name and users received a user name and a password &quot; to get through the Fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocked . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of which , it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity to access the network . &quot;
&quot; yet , it is not known that such plans exist . &quot;
Exper@@ t@@ innen and experts on site are skep@@ tical regarding the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; &quot; research scientist &quot; &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; &quot; Egyptian initiative &quot; &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
&quot; I doubt the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that deal with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they believe that just as they are ex@@ iting physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take it seriously , this means that they will be able to establish a strong surveillance system that apply to citizens or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people , and also to bring them to a court process . &quot;
this is technically clear - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the committee of the Parliament and the Constitutional committees before it enters the plenary session . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is consistent with a pro @-@ military mind in parliament , whose sense is to be maxim@@ ized and assured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the foot@@ print , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MPs called Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ wy proposed a law against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long arrest for those who were found guilty to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq work the Ti@@ ersch@@ Ã¼tz@@ erin H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq to protect the spiritual leop@@ ards .
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of Leop@@ ards , which is tr@@ apped by Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . overall , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and the frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they are getting fewer pre@@ y , at risk . &quot;
why is this particular type of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; Persian leop@@ ard is the only remaining rob@@ bery in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a great beast is available . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ards is actually going to see in the free wild , is low and goes against zero . when the team in video presents that they have a shot of a great cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained Bi@@ olog@@ in , R@@ aza passion@@ ately ad@@ mon@@ gers a different side of their country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
it has been involved in dirt studies on wild animals and at educational programs of Nature Iraq .

&quot; in the beginning of March 2017 , the daily newspaper Ka@@ ho@@ ku shar@@ imp@@ o , the progress made in the last six years have been affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a vast earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered a catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has its headquarters in S@@ end@@ ai , which is in pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , which had to experience both the earthqu@@ akes and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iw@@ asi@@ ons have been di@@ zed because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ish whole coastal cities of the map .
&quot; in this way , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a nuclear accident , already at least 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses . &quot;
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o will report from a local point of view which progress made for six years to rebuild the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the paper involves both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of those concerned themselves .
&quot; apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iv@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts ( conven@@ ing ) , &quot; sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the Pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ ates were finished . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three Pre@@ fec@@ tures could draw Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were finished . &quot;
&quot; Iw@@ ato has finished 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima is the light of Fu@@ kus@@ hima with 70 percent of the light &apos;s light . &quot;
&quot; however , one still makes every effort to le@@ ak six years after the catastrophe , evac@@ u@@ ated by Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ accommodation ( the addition of the , Cau@@ c@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final spare parts . &quot;
&quot; after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in total shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , 36 000 people lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iw@@ asi@@ ons in such containers . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 per cent of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still lives in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas at Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the evac@@ u@@ ated shel@@ ters , were converted into final houses after disaster . &quot;
for Iv@@ ata the number here is at 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
&quot; how the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o &apos;s newspaper was able to determine 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by un@@ for@@ ten to December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of schools of the three Pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three Pre@@ fec@@ tures are much more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while almost 100 percent of the fish bre@@ wing in Iv@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back in operation , Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of the fisheries have resum@@ ed their operation . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have moved in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agriculture , large @-@ scale . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the Bar@@ och@@ land in Iv@@ ata and less than 50 % destroyed A@@ cker@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the atomic fact , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed A@@ cker@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima are located in the &quot; nuclear zone &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fecture , tourism has recovered and recovered , but also Fu@@ kus@@ hima is far de@@ be@@ aten . &quot;
&quot; the tourist tax in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ ates are back to 90 percent on the same level , as before the un@@ happiness . Fu@@ kus@@ hima on the other hand , only 75 percent can be found here . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal inhabitants , it is harder to earn their living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to establish a picture , the newspaper led numerous surveys among the local population and among the evac@@ u@@ ated by . she asked her about the state of re @-@ build and also how their rebellion has changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
in their introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness under the local population .
&quot; the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures have taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 55.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents , that still did not do enough in the disasters of disasters . &quot;
&quot; as it stands for those who had to evac@@ u@@ ated from the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima &quot;
in her edition for the anniversary of the earthquake the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has reinforced its attention also to the situation of the evac@@ u@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima does not only have to experience the enormous earthquake and the devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , cat@@ astroph@@ ism caused , atomic o@@ fall , the Japan ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 evac@@ u@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 there were slightly more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent replacement parts . &quot;
&quot; according to the status of 2017 , more than 40 000 inhabitants live from Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their home pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in the cat@@ astroph@@ y areas most of the evac@@ u@@ ties have to be returned , over 50 years old . they have to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Iv@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is a construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo . &quot;
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when one encounters people from other countries , who speak another language , the differences appear to be greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one often recognis@@ es that one more connects than it at first glance . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we talk to five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
&quot; verse Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man , as the love of music has consolidated the lack of joint lingu@@ istic knowledge during a journey in rural China ; Adriana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time where they worked with people from around the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b look back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care station : last Friday had a police officers in a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nation@@ wide millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest against austerity .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the federal university Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a sk@@ ull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors sacrific@@ ed this Saturday and now got him in an artificial coma .
its condition is considered critical .
&quot; the local sculp@@ tural journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread within a few days rapidly in Brazil . &quot;
in the pictures the face of the police officers is also identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the incident , the Military Police in the Brazilian federal state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o has to sus@@ pen@@ ed to the conclusion of the investigation of the incident from the active service . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his head@@ stock on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
would a police be@@ amed of a prot@@ esters in@@ duced by a prot@@ esters and at the Inten@@ sive station would be to see his face six months long in television and the whole repression would therefore justified .

&quot; another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective is filmed on social networks . &quot;
in the below clip one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( approximately 2.@@ 700 Euro ) to cover a portion of the costs for medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , while he is in the hospital . &quot;

Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only State in Brazil in which it occurred last Friday for brutal forces against prot@@ esters .
&quot; polic@@ emen were put on protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where prot@@ esters had established a stage for Red@@ ner , rubber and Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the MEP Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace &apos;s Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , the police asked by l@@ oud@@ speakers to disp@@ ense with violence against prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country . &quot;

&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reasons , more about a broken window , than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special cause . &quot;
&quot; this is necessary to recognize , if you are strictly against any form of atomic damage . &quot;

the villages of the in@@ duc@@ tory forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso we joined almost hundreds of sugar be@@ ques in the whole of Cuba the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the general community of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ ab@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar@@ s - regardless of that there is no native sugar be@@ et on site . &quot;
it is two years since the activities in the sugar@@ s .
&quot; after decre@@ asing the sugar cane industry in the region stood still , and the factory lost , and after its plants , until only the sc@@ af@@ folding of steel and concrete remained to be left . &quot;
about 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent .
some changes the work .
other res@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied and sh@@ ing@@ les daily to the factories , which are still m@@ ahlen . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who stands up at 4 : 00 am in the morning , consuming the crisis in the sugar cane industry . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the region of sugar@@ s , which have been in operation for long in@@ active time because they were obtained . &quot;
it was something that he did not expect .
N@@ ene reminds us that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich would get the sugar cane factory but the promise has not been held .
&quot; the sugar cane industry had already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ effic@@ ien@@ cies , the poor administrative decision and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 the production of 1,6 million tons of sugar was produced , less than 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for turbul@@ ence for the country a few decades , but the poor harv@@ esting are not a new one . &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an sugar@@ s industry ?
the old railway line of the church saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was a economic necessity : the 155 sugar be@@ fabri@@ ken were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they were un@@ sustainable to the country . &quot;
the initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target amo@@ unted to 4 million tons . &quot;
they left only the factories left to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose up about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; Agriculture and FAO , the agricultural and Nutri@@ tion@@ ists of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the present output would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tons ) , the pipe @-@ export would be approx . 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day , security will come into history with certainty that were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from there , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years the lac@@ tation came from a total of 98 sugar@@ s factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane fabrik Greg@@ orio Arl@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked since 1967 in the factory .
&quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , says the closing of the factory , is the word that he is repeated on most , &quot; fraud . &quot;
nearly all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order to get the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first consecutive year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially recognised by officially documents that would be removed only regarding the parts which would be removed , the addres@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister was able to make any de@@ posit@@ . &quot;
&quot; from there , the responsibility was over@@ due and the letters come more and more frequent . &quot;
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still operational sugar be@@ et factories .
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another complex , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was opposed to his will at the lac@@ tation of the factory , with whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with each part that he removed , he dismant@@ led one of his 31 years . &quot;
the industry &apos;s best developed industry is er@@ ased from Cuba and more important work@@ flows .
&quot; in many cases , no alternative for working places and services that were generated in the communities in which they were created . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president in the eyes of the present persons looked , as he had guaranteed that for the areas whose factories would no longer run in operation for five years . &quot;
the price of the population for the closing of the sugar@@ be@@ et factories
since 2004 the sugar tube will be extrac@@ ted only high by the elections .

&quot; after two years the folk sculpture of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the cand@@ ro@@ hr@@ ack closed , or better said than they began , they devi@@ ate , they also listened to , the road to asp@@ hal@@ ting , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with an advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy other factories had to look up . &quot;
they have been assigned to spare parts .
&quot; without future perspective , many young people settled the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area a food factory was created , whose production serves not even for the care of the church . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new facility are still impos@@ ing .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;

first Nations @-@ teenagers are using Hip Hop to express themselves and maintain their own culture

young people of the First Nations communities across Canada employ issues that are important to them . do they do with Hip Hop thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour bring the world leader mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres , in order to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live appearances since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and then worked in North Quebec with ten Caes@@ ree and then with the C@@ ree Hip Hop group &quot; The North@@ Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants will discuss topics like &quot; cultural identity , language , examination , love , self acceptance , or whatever happens in mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the trunk of the Winn@@ eb@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the School &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the kit@@ es@@ kal@@ um First nation in British Columbia , for example , the history of the Highway 16 , also &quot; Highway the tears , &quot; on which nearly two dozen most indigenous young women disappeared or mur@@ dered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ explained .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the mot@@ if of a video player to convey how important to preserve traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of globalisation . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in Indi@@ gen@@ ous languages , although the young people are unable to master the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First nation recorded , the chor@@ us is sung to C@@ ree . &quot;
the youth involved here received some help from Gary Jol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hip Hop group who gave them a St@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
&quot; on the Fac@@ ebook@@ side of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an stands at the St@@ rop@@ he in heading , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German here : &quot;
sometimes I feel as if nobody ever interested in me
but I try to go on earth my days on earth
that is the day when you take our cry
because we have lost our way to life as a youth
&quot; but I believe that we will rise to one day , &quot;
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and lead to our youth
&quot; thus , they can do that what they are determined by the Creator . &quot;
&quot; in the commentary box , the reader and supporters of the C@@ ree @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ sec@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the St@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ ben@@ ds ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
in Japan plastic meals are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan one can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are being exhibited close to the input sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the expansion of the &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tical models of dishes &quot; ) of every meal , which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers look at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the making of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small companies who produced those plastic dishes that the German fil@@ mm@@ akers Wim Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a about 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese people , these plastic meals are as usual that they will not even be re@@ fresh for them . however , a new trend is transformed into stri@@ k@@ able cell accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
when Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome released the blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
&quot; now in the special sale : new with plastic springs , decor@@ ating mobile phones , as they are shown at K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Kauf@@ haus . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been turned to kit@@ sch@@ y gathering , as in this case , cool@@ ers magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin Cooler mag@@ net for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station .
the new boom of the Essen@@ tial shows is increasingly challenging .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel bowl with seafood ) has turned into a mobile st@@ ine .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a cell phone .
we have also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that po@@ urs your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a candle for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning from a growing flight to the kom@@ an .
some mobile phones and phone designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or Sal@@ s@@ wind@@ led is used to be a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can temp@@ ted my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot;
I believe I will probably be the Only .
&quot; this interest in plastic springs can also take a less appe@@ tizing form , to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant . &quot;
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of mel@@ ting ice cream .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and Hand@@ y@@ belts made of dried salmon . &quot;
further sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic meals can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter using the has@@ ht@@ ag # 4 .
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi that dedic@@ ates the Bel@@ ie@@ fer@@ ing of the restaurant industry . such as with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic meals are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survi@@ vor@@ s of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; in reports in@@ - and foreign media via the &quot; &quot; fighting against drug trading &quot; &quot; in Mexico you dive at regular statistics only in statistics . however , they do not only reflect the extent of the human tragedy , which brings this fight with it . &quot;
&quot; the coverage of drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ells , the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , no one looks at the sad@@ ness or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind each bon@@ ding , in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wo@@ unds might never heal . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico is the digital project &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; with drug trading living &quot; ) to give this sacrifice a voice , and stories of people who told the struggle between the criminal enforcement authorities and the anti @-@ inflammatory drugs . &quot;
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , if shops close , because they are threatened by drug retailers and all the congreg@@ ations have to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk . &quot;
pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear lives &quot; ) tells you exactly these stories .
&quot; one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , which is looking for every weekend tom@@ bs according to his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , which lost to only one day her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of their ne@@ ph@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; priest : &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task we have put , go and to gra@@ ves , according to the people we have loved to look for . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Contr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Contr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , which is here with me . &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but they do not get paid , because that demand a mortality . &quot;
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are putting fear . we need to show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in Hoch@@ ris@@ ko areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that violence should never look normal to normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
disease and Sens@@ ations@@ journ@@ alism I have known now for a couple of years .
I come over every day and see the title pages with pictures that actually only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from experts from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I feel as if I am the Only , which is in@@ born or sad . it affects how a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body once . &quot;
I cannot be equally valid or consider this as normal .
it continues to write :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year cous@@ in thinks he is called Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) will be when he is great . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of criminal off@@ ence , if they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , this is as if they were temp@@ ting those who have lost someone , and those who are afraid that they also happen in such a thing . &quot;
I see our weakness if stories about mere numbers are taken in a statisti@@ c .
the in@@ som@@ nia of the people is incredible for me if the death of six people and the dis@@ appearances of 43 students in a neigh@@ bor had been justified that they were un@@ interrupted .
&quot; I think they are trying to speak out of such trag@@ e@@ dies , if they are not sti@@ r and silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family was pressed by dr@@ ones , from the end of money by their business , until they had not only destroyed the business but also their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain never ends it , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes back high , if you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed and phone numbers too .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are removed , the better . &quot;
they included her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you do not know when they are de@@ duc@@ ted or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I wonder@@ ed if wines would dis@@ solve my deep @-@ ro@@ oting feelings , but the answers is no , because I forgot how to live . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : one of the violence marked by violence .
&quot; in the introduction he raises questions on how : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man , who was mur@@ dered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents worry about them . &quot;
&quot; br@@ yan is a commodity and he tells that he bo@@ iling a egg , potatoes br@@ es , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the kitt@@ ens who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bott@@ ling with water , sugar and milk pul@@ ver . &quot;
he tells about the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are un@@ important compared to pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live .
&quot; when he was five years old , one told him that his mother have disappeared . &quot;
&quot; but that was not the day , in which his childhood ended . &quot;
&quot; his childhood has been past two years ago , when he had only shot a few blocks from his home , the bloody body of his father , was shot by armed men from a car @-@ car car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence organised by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of citizenship in public security and government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this is equivalent to the cut 8,5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot;
these are just a few of a hundred mill@@ en@@ nia stories that leaves the organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only a few stories live in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those that we must not forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico 2015 created the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose objective is to tor@@ mented the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trading that has tor@@ tured the country over the past four decades , in intel@@ li@@ gible manner . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Shar@@ ing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flick@@ r @-@ User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ ARN@@ ING : this contribution and the pages , to which he linked , contain images to which violence is represented . &quot;
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to up@@ lift a ru@@ mo@@ urs or fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but what is the years after just the first time ago ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first release , it was mis@@ leading to be@@ ating trag@@ e@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupl@@ ing of image and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dr@@ aft News - deny not the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
it also raises questions about our request to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 a pet@@ rol station wagon the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . there were 230 people around the world . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war in Africa the second largest land had been neglected and thus devast@@ ated . the streets in the region were turned into dangerous paths , which were difficult to drive . &quot;
trag@@ ically followed by the pet@@ rol station to the victim .
&quot; officials described a fire@@ ball , the du@@ tz@@ ing houses , including a movie theaters in the vicinity , which was full of people , which illustr@@ ates the World Cup championship . &quot;
houses scattered and low cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the ignorance .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ users My@@ stic@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 . January 2015 multiple photos of the incident form the gray scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it displays rows of a hol@@ low body which are up on the ground while individuals are watching them .
but here the story is not their end .
&quot; over the years , the same photo has been raised several times in social media , blogs and other platforms , but not related to the related trag@@ e@@ dies , particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 fighters of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the Nig@@ erian villages B@@ aga and Dor@@ o Go@@ won .
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dramatically from atro@@ cities to whom they had to fl@@ ee .
houses and shops were burned down and bar @-@ names were in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; nobody stayed back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said one inhabitants to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were das@@ hed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the following time could be displayed . &quot;
the reason for the attack was also uns@@ ol@@ ved but the armies point in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerg@@ es of the DR Congo again when evidence was seen as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a mass@@ acre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
you are not Charlie .
you are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ rup@@ tible use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ations ; Africa Check has written orders to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all these cases the picture was taken as a proof of mass@@ ages .
&quot; another step further bring personal comments like this example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments . &quot;
the picture from S@@ ange entered in Myanmar with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash registration , published by the United Nations , those who were able to fl@@ ee , rape and several deaths , some through comb@@ us@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; while others reported by violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts , like the following , these descriptions were gathered with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from a sau@@ di @-@ Arabic post @-@ direction , which was argu@@ ed that President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein is said that mon@@ ks and politicians have participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to show this information . &quot;
&quot; the original article on which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organisations , the AF@@ P as their source , have also c@@ ron@@ g@@ ly written Th@@ ein His message , but had not associated with the image from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range false information
traces of this incorrect cross @-@ ups are coming back to 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; using a &quot; &quot; converted image search &quot; &quot; you can see how far more information can be crossed . &quot;
&quot; a converted images with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 18,@@ 8 billion pictures ( updated from 3 May 2017 ) 344 images , which are very similar to the picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mix@@ er private sides , platforms of social media and community , as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek , and Portuguese . &quot;
some have passed wrong reports forwar@@ ded to others have tried to un@@ masks the counter@@ f@@ akes .
&quot; we have taken examples of the mis@@ used usage and linked with the respective countries , based on which side they were published . thus , we want to be more evident than through the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases also inter@@ connected ) , several examples may be used for mis@@ used use . &quot;
here are some cases that can now be solved completely ( on the map in Orange ) :

&quot; the countries in grey are examples which are available according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also f@@ eit@@ ing examples . &quot;
as a reminder the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( in blue ) .

&quot; this post @-@ party res@@ c@@ ept@@ ed that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein His 2012 have been given that mon@@ ks and politicians have been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story together with the image from S@@ ange . &quot;
&quot; the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication , the image is still included in it . &quot;
Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 had been brought about students , published by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by the cath@@ oli@@ an outside of An@@ Ã¡@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly indicated that the image does not origin@@ ate from the k@@ ill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar sl@@ ant attack &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture was later in connection with the mass@@ acre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am from 2015 in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to res@@ ist that there would be connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ j@@ ery@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ thin y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ uy &quot; ( Nigeria burning , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the picture of the DR Congo has emerged , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ has@@ ht@@ ag , and proceeds a discussion among Muslims following the mass@@ acre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities had these events , the mut@@ u@@ dly in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
United States , 2015 . &quot;
the picture was we@@ ath@@ ered as proof of the mass@@ acre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times rescue ) . but the messages that were associated with it were not interven@@ ed in any religious context .
&quot; instead , the goal was to direct attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting relevant to the comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message which alleg@@ edly had been written by a &quot; &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; over the Nig@@ erian mass@@ acre , in circulation , there were discussion on the Vietnam@@ ese and explained it to Fal@@ sch@@ ow . &quot;
&quot; from the message where the image from the DR Congo has been included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; another confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the work@@ book in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye can also be trac@@ eable , but are no longer completely re@@ trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
&quot; ( data entries with URLs and tim@@ es@@ - / fil@@ mm@@ c@@ ach@@ ers exist on the web cra@@ w@@ ler , and they have a file name in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim Muslims . ) &quot;
&quot; in all of these cases , which appeared only after the original un@@ gl@@ ers of 2010 , the picture is ultimately possibly a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and images
&quot; there are two strong topics or Fr@@ ames , who under@@ go that Po@@ sts . the first Fr@@ ame is focused on religion . &quot;
the photo has been used in relation to major discussions on silence in connection with the revival of Christians by Muslims or - to defend Muslims - the revival of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second ro@@ aming uses the image to discuss how a African life is rated compared to a European or French life .
religion is wanting to understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth examine how images are used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; but a deeper issue is however , what happens when reading these images can no longer be belief . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who acci@@ dental to practice the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggest that mood of mis@@ - and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and decor@@ ates it the real atro@@ city of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and in Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of vast images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
&quot; an argument is that the back hold of images of a ref@@ us@@ al , the tragedy can be seen . sometimes these images are even requested by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent images and spect@@ ators should des@@ en@@ si@@ ze and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which examined how violent media work to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss the depic@@ tions in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s message reporting . &quot;
&quot; Techn@@ ologists did experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . &quot; you will have to think about the situation in which an image can be sug@@ ed , but actually dis@@ solved by the context or in completely ab@@ usive manner . &quot;
&quot; however , each investig@@ ative subsidies should also take into account as internationally as possible . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo of Andy S@@ imm@@ ons uses according to CC BY @-@ N@@ D 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ transl@@ atable ( e.g. . un@@ over@@ practic@@ able ) makes a choice of words to provide a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
&quot; such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known ( as the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ br@@ esa ) .
but all res@@ ist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly each attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , so a complete explanation and sometimes some context are required to accurately understand what is meant by that one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
in the blog you can find example words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; - Bem@@ an around your parents in recognition of how to strive for you in your younger years . &quot;
&quot; and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ zin@@ ess that you feel after having rolled on cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
&quot; they de@@ fi@@ sts other cultures , reve@@ aling other thought @-@ off and wake up our re@@ gi@@ er@@ de . &quot;
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page and show more of these &quot; un@@ brid@@ geable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is going by the worst fl@@ ut@@ cat@@ astrop@@ hic disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is at the moment the worst flood of flood disaster in this decade .
&quot; from the mon@@ soon to the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya has entered into 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; after an opinion of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic center of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of men are missing because of the floods and Schl@@ amm@@ ers . &quot;
over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe locations .
&quot; the rains left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the waters were slowly coming back in some areas . &quot;
health and hygien@@ ic proportions of the population represent massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following photos and videos convey an impression of the extent of the Fl@@ ut@@ cat@@ disaster :
floods in the Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water objects up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the has@@ ht@@ ag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lan@@ kas deadly floods hit the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ eber@@ ger , war@@ ns Save the Children , after further rain falls are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the flood , water @-@ rose up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the yesterday covered water p@@ eg@@ els of Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
&quot; air @-@ monkey has provided five planes for lif@@ ebo@@ arding campaigns , and further five are made ready for transport of emergency services for those in their floo@@ ded villages . &quot;
various organizations and start @-@ ups have been prepared to help .
Facebook @-@ Pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tory in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high @-@ water situations and humanitarian assistance .

&quot; likewise , they led a &quot; SOS &quot; button that had more than thousands of requests and 150 successful boat transactions for through high @-@ water and Er@@ dr@@ ut@@ sche @-@ closed people . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts by the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , residents do not bring people in need of security and help help . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lan@@ kas is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;

&quot; use case , as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour , and love me . &quot;
&quot; I trust her four year old daughter , they trust me their children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
in the one minute we call for slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
in the next scale we respect rights for trans@@ gender .
&quot; we are in a sea of shelves and people , some keep the iconic picture of a woman with sc@@ arf high , bound up from an American flag , other sk@@ andi@@ ate slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend look at me and say , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern yourself , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I wonder . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their vision . &quot;
they all@@ evi@@ ate me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be Muslim in different kind . but somehow we will all be plug@@ ged into the same Muslim @-@ dra@@ wer .
&quot; this dra@@ wer is so well constructed in our collective idea so well that as soon as Muslims , which as I do not fit there , are Muslim . &quot;
mi@@ tig@@ ated will be
I am not alone .
&quot; that is even to the poet , whose poetry in America is selling is : Rum@@ i . &quot;
which images come one in the sense when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ ant Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a orthodo@@ x @-@ mix@@ er pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western vision , religion Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of the reduced images of Muslims , Western books have been colon@@ ized for centuries . &quot;
this temp@@ ting image is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid cr@@ ush the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures continue to stand out even today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood poison@@ ing them continue . &quot;
&quot; I worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ ative Nar@@ r@@ ative can be domin@@ ate our new@@ s@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the USA could not even choose their first female presidential race . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v failed to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are encouraged to wear their sc@@ ro@@ ud in public buildings and pur@@ di @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body to cover the entire two sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this strong Nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ens Muslim women , movements for change . &quot;
it looks across that the first Muslim prayers were spoken in the American soil of Afri@@ cans who were brought here again with slave @-@ ships .
it delet@@ es the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v has engaged our collective imagination , so deeply and inf@@ alli@@ ed that often Si@@ kh men and children are becoming the target of anti @-@ militar@@ ist attacks and dec@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , &quot; Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
belong to 1.7 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we are doing more than just stories to tell that are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative that help us understand the world .
&quot; and my industry has failed to grasp the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;
and we are here pro@@ found@@ ly where seven million Muslims establish the highest degree in America in the highest degree .
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ African Americans .
&quot; six of ten American Muslims belong to the emig@@ rants of the first generation , which come from 77 countries . &quot;

four decades ago my immig@@ rant &apos;s parents came to live in New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scrapers of New York ; sky@@ scrapers have been made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ sts from Bangladesh by the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; back then when the sky@@ lines of the world was new , my parents were un@@ um@@ wo@@ unds Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now un@@ connected Muslim and Americ@@ anism ?
&quot; sometimes when I ask people why I don &apos;t eat pig meat , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes or get my hand@@ able bu@@ ck Cor@@ an that all Muslims carry out - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I Scher@@ ze we don &apos;t carry out all bu@@ ckl@@ es with us .
we do not need to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to almost always be selected for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of prominent Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists , who strive to fight widespread lies over Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced at the current volume of a well @-@ ed Islam@@ ism with credit@@ ors , t@@ ink tanks and experts for Fal@@ sch@@ information that is already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ ism exists in more than just a stran@@ ger that gives a woman the he@@ aters . &quot;

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ugly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
&quot; it attacks our identity , which is as widely as diverse and multi @-@ lay@@ ered , that it can impossible to fit into a dra@@ wer . &quot;

use approved .
I want to explain that .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but a Muslim was born only in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ i@@ anic church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientist may describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ cular faith and behavior might not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend would see my neighbour , my neighbour , my rock in the fire that I am Muslims when they could watch through the 15 meters of concrete and air which separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the all@@ ab@@ etic ritual with my daughter , when I do@@ cked her into my arms , and her the Arab verses to protect the protection , and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
every one of them repeat three times .
&quot; I therefore ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one you can see and the evil one can &apos;t see . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ li@@ ant faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow . &quot;
&quot; the grand@@ mother of the author , when they won an I@@ k@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters sometime in the 1960s . &quot;
use approved .
belonging to my grand@@ mother is the image of my grand@@ mother and her sisters ; as she won a competition of art of flowers in Kar@@ achi decades ago .
&quot; it is the picture of her that I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings , a book with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and four@@ teen chapters that they can almost fold . &quot;
&quot; Muslims also means to speak the prayers , which they said to me , when I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; Muslims led to Muslims as she brought me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that - over centuries - through a &quot; Empire &quot; col@@ oni@@ alized , which has established a company with the name of Ven@@ erable ey@@ e@@ dies , has a deep meaning to call God , my only Lord . &quot;
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
&quot; belonging means to grow and listen to , that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my zu@@ ander@@ ed grandfather wept . &quot;
&quot; middle @-@ style , while he writes books about the modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , crying , crying Ja@@ an un@@ um@@ wo@@ unds around his family in India &apos;s conquered K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he could not close in his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to knowledge is that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians whose families were scattered , as with my grandfather , of col@@ oni@@ alists , who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot;
&quot; Muslim is to be knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have been colon@@ ized by four Muslim countries &quot; colonial countries . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it means to know , that the first a@@ erial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the story was raised above a century over a Muslim country . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an intimate , ash@@ mir of the British empire , was described as &quot; dangerous , &quot; as it led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; even before there were planes he travelled in more parts of the world than I ever was and pre@@ ached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; to my Muslim tribe of the 1,@@ 7 billion go deep into our unforgettable gene@@ alog@@ es ; our un@@ disturbed story . &quot;
&quot; it means to remind that four@@ teen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops being distributed across each continent aside from the Antarc@@ tica , being distributed in Iraq to em@@ ate mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried in the ruins of the war .
&quot; to be an American Muslims , knowing that the self @-@ workers under Veter@@ ans since 2001 has risen by more than 32 percent . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that when a tragedy is seeking the United States and the susp@@ ects a Muslim names , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white bom@@ bed . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that four@@ teen hundred years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , called by a liber@@ ated black slaves with the name Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad vers@@ kl@@ av@@ t and brought into this land .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X a American hero .
&quot; it is the warmth that I sen@@ sed , when people filled the airports in order to fight against the Muslim B@@ an . &quot;
it is the hope I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; to be a Americ@@ anism , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim and a journalist means , the in@@ dur@@ ated inter@@ sec@@ tional identi@@ ties , but it fail to fail them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1,@@ 7 billion has more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ ous c@@ ubes , but it is represented in the reduction of doubt &quot; we &quot; against them . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother to care for my child and all Muslim children , pleas@@ ent that do@@ ve and privileged people on this doub@@ ting structural Islam@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim Regi@@ str@@ aps , which began with President Bush and enlarged under President Obama . &quot;
it is in the end @-@ to @-@ end monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it consists in the immigration , which takes a five year old child in hand @-@ taking . &quot;
it consists in a country that closes its limits towards people from just the countries that bom@@ bed it bom@@ bed .
it is a false and neb@@ ul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ Fly @-@ list &quot; which takes largely Arabs and Muslims into the sight .
&quot; they are the wars , which we lead and the bom@@ bs we desc@@ end to Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and due to those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study with the title Asc@@ ent of Man , the scientists of North@@ western University participants showed a scientifically proven image and b@@ loc@@ ates them , groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
Con@@ vers@@ ations we need to lead
&quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ing to dism@@ iss the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
we stand back decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous figur@@ ative prints we owe in our news actions .
&quot; at least there is a growing motion , led by American Muslims within the media industry which attempts to grasp our frequently with Bin@@ dest@@ ri@@ chen identi@@ ties and forget history . &quot;
&quot; Pod@@ cast Lake Some@@ thing , S@@ ay Some@@ thing by Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral Vide@@ os@@ erie Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to multip@@ ly Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all of this makes me hope . &quot;

&quot; but I am worried due to this difficult global time , in which we are located . &quot;
and this moment has consequences that go beyond 1.@@ 7 billion .
&quot; there is a reason for the conspir@@ acies that existed in the dark corners of the internet , now the White House lead . &quot;
they are exp@@ on@@ ential because they have made Muslims too &quot; others .
&quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ entially , having created the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a few years ago it had not been given them , and now they domin@@ ate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am worried about the realities and history , who I was not aware of how it was my daughter now , but who now have made me to an in@@ w@@ reck@@ age Muslim today . &quot;
things I left here like a tan track in my speech .
&quot; things that may aw@@ aken memories , for in all the inter@@ co@@ ction that makes our humanity like a story , where someone is made to another &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , they will be held as part of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; &quot; Other &quot; , &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
but these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools or which we read in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell you here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people caused by the creation of the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; in the public perception , four decades itself was Scientific of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we must ask ourselves un@@ convenient questions after the role of this , consciously and un@@ aware of the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; ; as it is my girlfriend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because he bom@@ bed a new future , while he is already bombar@@ ded by countries and &quot; to other common &quot; people , &quot; goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .

&quot; in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS already has conducted events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages do not be passed on to the children born children . &quot;
for the creators of the project :
&quot; the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we do not have cities to embrace the diversity - safe spaces , in which residents do not have to forget who they are . &quot;
&quot; while listening is often linked with it , these events are instead called &quot; the listening to appreciate , to feel . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers will tell her story first in her own language and translate them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their devotion and their presentation make that listening to it . &quot;
they call laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows for example a traditional history from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou is also the opportunity to explain to their land typical customs of tale . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the F@@ abel of the rab@@ bits and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zim@@ babwe :
&quot; after he explains the meaning of his F@@ abel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara will be asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that does not share your language ? &quot; with a wide crest , he shares his sense of inclusi@@ veness : &quot;
you listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were very happy with me !
&quot; to date , the events offered by Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling in three cities have taken place , and the organizers hope to extend it . all who are inspired by the project can organize with T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the US re @-@ recovery of the sovereign debt
&quot; with the aim of a re@@ viewing of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took up to 72 million US dollars , participated in various religious and civil organizations in a mass demonstration ; the march began to visit the capital Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
it was called by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ Ã­a de la D@@ eu@@ da &quot; ( civil Front for the Neur@@ ory of debts ) and the Ã@@ Com@@ en@@ ian church Meeting in Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the inter@@ ach@@ ers of the debts of the debts have also filed a petition on the official home page of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demands that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts are responsible for their corrupt . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial examination and a governance committee without personal interests in public debt , with strong , our working conditions , which acts in favor of the economy . &quot;
we will press and suppres@@ sed .
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refused to pay a debt , which is not their . &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not find themselves with the retirement deposits .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not into the states in the territory of the USA - is suffering from a serious financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; is a ruling non @-@ independent non @-@ profit organisation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a vast restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; from the outside rise , measures will be imposed without the participation and conviction of the citizen &apos;s risk of being rejected by the people . &quot;
the demonstration brought the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

artists and writers appreciate the work of the missing Syrian development of Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi
Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi and his wife N@@ oura .

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , is missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives have continued his liberty and remind the contributions that he has made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on digital culture , which is focused in Berlin , devoted to an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the Company &apos;s CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , published books from the book C@@ ost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and here license is freely available , contains a number of approaches that deal with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it means :
&quot; this book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge , and what the real costs are , with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , developers , researchers and authors who have worked on the movements for free knowledge , have worked on page to create over the fog who surround our new@@ s@@ eds and to create some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and consolidated internet volunteers , who has been incar@@ cer@@ ated in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra jail , in which he sat on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or residence . &quot;
the introduc@@ tory part of his book entitled Coll@@ ective Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom immediately .
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for its participation in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , acts and decisions . &quot;
why are we today ?
what have we decided ?
what have we abandoned in this process of temporarily extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in cust@@ ody of government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was composed of the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , transferred to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and Ombud@@ sper@@ son N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi reported that the &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el reported on the basis of a &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who presented himself as the insi@@ der of Assad regime and put them knowledge of a rich death sentence against her husband . &quot;
his place of residence and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in making access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and currently over the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; maybe none of the Bas@@ sels cultural prot@@ otypes fores@@ ee as the work , which he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the fork of many civi@@ lizations , and here mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with hi@@ des traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would put everything in it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strip in the digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a period of time , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of inv@@ alu@@ able value . &quot;
&quot; however , Bass@@ el could not complete this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my overall life with it , of freedom to dream and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el brought me English for even when he was already in cust@@ ody .
&quot; I learned to read and speak English well , writing and speak . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with each , who asked me . he taught others to read English , to write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el has opened me the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computer and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also brought to other prisoners , as they use computer , at least theoretically without being able to actually hold a hold in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a pro@@ pul@@ ling that she wrote in the years 2012 until 2015 her husband , when he was in cust@@ ody . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ oura have worked together on the book for a year .
she ador@@ ned the lyrics to him when she visited him and he re@@ igned them out of the Arabian @-@ Arabic English .
the book is license @-@ free .
book@@ ke@@ eper from Youssef N@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; it is done by any visit , &quot;
&quot; that in the world of your charming sight , &quot;
&quot; that I lose sight , in the moment we embrace . &quot;
&quot; however , that any of the dangers is concerned , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , bond@@ ages and watch@@ men &quot;
I forget the cr@@ ush of the prison
and I see in every detail of your voice and words
that I carry with passion for me
when your eyes are saying
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; return quickly to my lon@@ eliness , &quot;
get back all the moments
and your absence to cry and smile .
&quot; I make myself finished myself , that I will return soon ... &quot;
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :
a year goes to my soul
during
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of the mon@@ ster

&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 , the regime of Bas@@ har al @-@ Ass@@ ads have disappeared after the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) more than 6@@ 5,000 people . &quot;
&quot; those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime , were tor@@ tured or even executed . &quot;
&quot; since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nest@@ y International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans in prison since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people are unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community demands since 2012 the release of Bass@@ el .
we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption ex@@ change@@ able director after res@@ ign@@ ation date
Moz@@ ambi@@ ans re@@ acted with anger on a corruption in which a government member has returned to the workplace during the state of the state of State in which corruption has been committed .
&quot; this was arrested by Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and joined together with four other def@@ endants because of the in@@ tran@@ sion of 54 million Me@@ al ( about 800 000 euro ) for 22 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the money was par@@ ked by public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , the Council Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately requested its re@@ adjustment into the company what happened on April 19th then .
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the general state office of the Republic , who value the application , there would be no hin@@ dering background for Cam@@ b@@ aza , to get back to its old post , as the company has no discipl@@ ined according to his cust@@ ody . &quot;
&quot; however , many people do not go well . &quot;
&quot; the Center for Public integrity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution responsible for public transparency , condemned in an interview with the Deutsche Welle the decision of the company , the director again : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption , and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a retreat with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we take note is that the company should have taken a discipline as a discipline as against the res@@ ellers .
&quot; however , the firm seems to appear and promp@@ ted any appropriate legal steps for applying the appropriate functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the mos@@ quit@@ ous social media , reject this behavior as well and considers the case as &quot; res@@ ale &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type , he would be advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a sentence and spent half of them . &quot;
&quot; he could keep paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could provide advice and his image . &quot;
&quot; but as he is in@@ competent , he has bound to be integrated into the company that he helped harm . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will be paid for his silence . &quot;
res@@ ist !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ ans and Student of Political Sciences in Brazil says , the director leaves no moral : &quot;
Cam@@ b@@ aza rewarded by the state because he bel@@ ated him I cannot believe it was rewarded someone in such a way that the state has already so massive .
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing to serve morality and to serve the state , * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served themselves by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as hand@@ some it has become an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself has become tired of det@@ ention that was charged and finally sentenced to a long arrest . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , I do not know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te prefer to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind you that a th@@ ief is heard in prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , the Moz@@ ambi@@ ators will not only be remembered as being the first independent president , but also as a sharp , cuts and - next door - proph@@ etic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was when he for@@ en@@ du@@ ly confirmed that &quot; a ambitious man is capable of being able , even the f@@ ather@@ land for his ambitions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambi@@ tional man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tactics , but he does not change from his ambitions . &quot;
a ambitious man is at the same time crimin@@ als .
in Twitter the reactions were also utter@@ ing :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he sat 10 years from and came free .
&quot; and today , he sets up the company where he cont@@ amin@@ ate money , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Î±@@ Cig@@ ales ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017 &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and c@@ ens@@ ored many users .
the bur@@ ial word &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or Spin@@ balls .
photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they enth@@ used the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although over the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East @-@ Indian origins , or generally used as an adj@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; Facebook c@@ ens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Be@@ verage &quot; &quot; ( in bur@@ ial scrip@@ tures ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of the dis@@ language in Burma during the social network . &quot;
in recent years the rise of radi@@ cal@@ al nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely valuable com@@ onn@@ ation .
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight in Myanmar , the company has a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;s usually associated with racism now , but the word itself is not automatically sign@@ alling . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also Po@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed by his use . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there are several bur@@ ial words with fundamental mean@@ ings that have the same letters as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written to Bur@@ mes@@ isch also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as &apos; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &apos; ( Cambodia ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ arc@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ ilities App@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends has been deleted now because he enth@@ used the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends on a rich way whether he knew his back pain , as he did his back pain . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the Fr@@ age@@ word ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ an - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win is the opinion that they will reduce high @-@ language radi@@ cal@@ al nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook analy@@ tic might be analytical , before it all Po@@ sts lo@@ dges that spread in the suspic@@ ion of racism . &quot;
Facebook delet@@ es the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
automation is not understood what you read on fac@@ et .
&quot; what it should do , the post office is carefully to analyze and control it by checking the next words . &quot;
&quot; for example &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; ( altern@@ ate ) . &quot;
&quot; the good is that these three @-@ legged nation@@ alists are spreading , a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circum@@ c@@ ate its nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to everyone , dis@@ semin@@ ating the dis@@ agreement , the efficiency of this strategy may not be long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of perc@@ ussions are often a kitt@@ ens and mouse game , whereby the user will start social networks just to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the zen@@ ed word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his post@@ ings , when he only wanted to inform his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned by the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was attentive to this new Directive on Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and I was not allowed to wi@@ den post and parts of content for 24 hours because of the post office &quot; Facebook Community standards . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions , or who simply try to show their opinions against the H@@ ass@@ speak radi@@ cal@@ al nation@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with speech : &quot;
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post the author divided his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ mes@@ an Internet Community to ask for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
to c@@ ensor such words becomes even more hat@@ red within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have said these words as &quot; &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; her@@ sen@@ curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even as they found that they have made mistakes , they attempted not to correct the fal@@ sely resolved posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits , which give them a great turnover , would be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has taken care of much sp@@ ott among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are now using Facebook funny and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of H@@ ass@@ language to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots from Facebook @-@ Po@@ sts , which have not been mis@@ used but nevertheless : &quot;
with permission used .
the bur@@ ial text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch an Indian film .
just to try out whether Facebook contains the mail that contains the word Kal@@ ar .
screens@@ hot with permission used .
&quot; the Post does &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot;
screens@@ hot with permission used .
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to bro@@ aden their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , ag@@ eing in social networks should also hei@@ ghten the violence in Myanmar in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced thousands to escape . &quot;
Facebook has been for his failure to criti@@ ci@@ ze the hungry h@@ ubs on his bur@@ ial pages under control .
&quot; but instead of simply doing the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better ongoing to concentrate on the context than on the code of concentrated initiatives and learned about them . &quot;
in Trin@@ id@@ ad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is an end to the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children of children is illegal in Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on June 9 , 2017 , the Parliament of the country has decided to unanim@@ ous a law which is expected to prohi@@ bit this practice so that a local age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; prior to this change of spouse , some members held Hin@@ du and Muslim religious community at practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aja said the leader of the inter @-@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group , the representatives of the various religious groups of the country , that the state does not inter@@ fere , since that , age not the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened despite the fact that Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago is a contracting parties in the UN &apos;s rights law , the min@@ ors as , , every man under 18 years . &quot;
&quot; statistics for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were married to 15 , in Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago 2,@@ 8 percent , and with 18 were 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the statisti@@ c central office of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 . &quot;
&quot; online petition and social media movements that stri@@ ves to create laws for children , followed at the foot and experienced great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this outcome . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , things were not going smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du @-@ leader Z. B. had no concerns about the critics of the children &apos;s before , they should say , dam@@ n &apos;t take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition cat@@ ered for tensions in this really un@@ complicated matter , and eventually no doubt came to whether the opposition would not agree to the law . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the draft law was decided against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
&quot; now , only the president of the country has to agree and declare the law . &quot;
&quot; one of the Sen@@ ators of the country gave to Facebook a status update , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle again posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram again : &quot;
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill &apos;s throw against the children &apos;s before was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and none other .
&quot; having decided before in the Senate , the draft can now be made to the law . &quot;
the majority of the social media users was enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws for the children were finally changed .
&quot; Facebook @-@ member Lov@@ ell Francis , who was an amb@@ assador of the Ministry of Defence , said : &quot;
&quot; it has all too much time and unnecessary straight@@ ede that did the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s before is illegal in Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago , and this is almost every cost . &quot;
&quot; while A@@ bel Jackson &apos;s opinion was , there was definitely long enough to get the practice was Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Her@@ vor@@ rag@@ ging news ! &quot;
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who belonged to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group that spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law is , noted : &quot;
the hei@@ r@@ able age in Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago is now independently of the religious con@@ fes@@ sions 18 years .
&quot; the draft for the changing of the spouse has been adopted today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 members and of which 35 were present during the vote . &quot;
&quot; all members , who were against , have agreed for the law . &quot;
&quot; for children , the children of Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago is not permitted by law . &quot;
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ r@@ ro@@ ying boo@@ sts .
many thanks to all activists who have challenged it .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
&quot; but a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aja , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du @-@ organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aja has announced his intention to undertake judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and it seems to have called its promises . &quot;
&quot; during the Direc@@ tor@@ ate @-@ General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , meant there would be certainly legal if Mahar@@ aja re@@ w@@ ged against the law , most social media users would like to tackle the debate differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of talking to the discussion , in a way that only panic and nonsense can give rise , that the state , our daughters before , would be that they may be of great , stub@@ born men who are opposed to their advantage , if you are then willing to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to a judicial procedure against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children are legally available in different grad@@ ations , or continuing the norm , although there are laws that they can . &quot;

&quot; the h@@ ackers broke the YouTube video , &quot; He is not a Dim@@ on for you &quot; on the pro@@ secution of the prosec@@ utor &apos;s website : &quot; &quot; the office of the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office calls for citizens to follow the pro@@ voc@@ ations , and keep away from all non @-@ sanc@@ tioned events . &quot;

mir@@ rors of web pages you can view Turkish users again Wikipedia @-@ content
&quot; the English @-@ language Wikipedia @-@ page was presented on 18 January 2012 , opposing the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A Copyright legislation in the USA , internationally mixed . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
since more than a month Turkey has been t@@ apped the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enzy@@ me Wikipedia .
day after day becomes more evident how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information and to share .
both students and re@@ por@@ ters and fans of TV series will fight against the lock@@ out .
&quot; though many techni@@ cian Internet users are used to use , envel@@ op@@ ing tools for non @-@ aligned websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reports about that Turkey has the third largest VP@@ N prevalence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been published since 2008 from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the internet has been adopted since 2007 , after the Internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the most known country in the world , when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains un@@ locked , there are now several mir@@ ror@@ sides ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and often updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform contains all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alised Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer @-@ Network ( i.e. machine calcul@@ ators ) which does not base on the system of domain names and thus making a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship . &quot;
the content is subject to legal notice however .
in a blog post IP@@ FS tells about his efforts :
&quot; after we heard the news ( about the block@@ age from Wikipedia ) , we put everything in it , snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the content on de@@ centralized and distributed manner . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to look at least all Wikipedia contents , even if you cannot reach the website www.@@ part itself . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS was also involved , that this step is accomplished independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it is merely a screen@@ shots , or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Vi@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to avoid the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Vi@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror@@ Website from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to produce similar mirror @-@ page when in the respective country Wikipedia is locked . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as employees at Mozilla in Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
&quot; there is no complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a mir@@ rors . &quot;
one gets to a different URL that is not the original one . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
&quot; in essence , the server heads the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if this is locked in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; for this is run by a server that is not in Turkey . &quot;

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he saw around him never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with poor@@ ly positioning and balanced colors .
the motiv@@ ating himself a camera to wear and try to walk the situation .
back then he was a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bro@@ aden themselves to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that direct the attention to Nep@@ al@@ ites . &quot;
he described on Facebook how he helps him the first @-@ class position in his job :
&quot; I live on the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
&quot; I am hearing myself straight at home , when I suddenly called Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father , that on the shore of the Rap@@ ti river was a leop@@ ard . &quot;
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I went with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side , where the leop@@ ard was found and I immediately started to cr@@ ush pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with authorities to gain global recognition for Nepal and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals aren &apos;t so fright@@ ened as they look .
&quot; and he should know , because he got tigers already from face to face : &quot;
a tiger can not inter@@ fere from the opinion of the sheep not at bed@@ time ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was at home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ har@@ ks appeared . he immediately sat down , we see ourselves and he sti@@ r me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit : I cli@@ cke for Environmental Protection ) on his photos . &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese and wildlife is not always easy .
&quot; he waited 22 days long , and mostly lived in one tent to make pictures of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , who live near the tourist accommodation . &quot;
see below some of these photos .

&quot; this article was written by Kay@@ ona@@ az Kaly@@ m@@ wal@@ a , and originally appeared on video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community association from India . &quot;
a revised version was released here as part of a Content @-@ Shar@@ ing Convention .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid having the greatest care to speak the name of their sp@@ ouses , or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a prono@@ uns or say &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ t@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh give women to respect that they should respect the husband due to social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should ab@@ used the norm . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a by a bul@@ let and accused of their family and the village community after they had addressed a loved relative . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives are likewise not called by name , is also common among men . however , they are far less common to fear if at all , they should not come from this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health care , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club , and thus became quick to the main theme of the city . &quot;
&quot; it is a place for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the int@@ ric@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that there are in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is run by the community of Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and supports the dismant@@ ling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with the help of her video camera at the un@@ covering of practices , such as children &apos;s hei@@ rat up to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ In@@ infected , and guides these clubs . &quot;
it tells about how these clubs created a safe place for these women and they have made them at the same time to amb@@ ass@@ ing the change .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini was shown in their discussion , was of women who call their sp@@ ouses in their name . &quot;
she decided on this subject because she wanted to open the interview about Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem that women can easily identify with .
&quot; the name of their sp@@ ouses not to speak out loud , is a bread that they must maintain all charges and never be questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini is :
this tradition testi@@ fied that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not hold this , is considered to be &quot; spirit@@ ually &quot; as woman without mor@@ als . &quot;
the tradition is deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini did not want to have called her husband to have never called on behalf at home , at home as it runs . &quot;
it showed the video of the discussion round of her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband are still far too long after the video was finished .
&quot; Pr@@ ak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I have to name him from now on his name . &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage Roh@@ ini started its first discussion .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the turn , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ t@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh . &quot;
&quot; after the video project , the women tried to bring the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different emotions - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked them all , &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our sp@@ ouses , but they can call us how they want , does that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be in@@ consistent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her sp@@ ouses on the lips , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the break of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women the names of their sp@@ ouses . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that she was only k@@ issed during the whole exercise ; another chose to release the whole fru@@ stration of fru@@ stration against him and his family by hiding him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in the adren@@ alin rush on , with an ancient fires , the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their sp@@ ouses in their name . &quot;
and they stopped their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put into the head : his wife could not stop his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner outside the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she was blin@@ ded , she got afraid and said that there was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I have to do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation art@@ ened in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reported how women have tried to stop other practices , such as the wearing of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dots on the forehead , which indicates the sp@@ ine : &quot;
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would carry the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot if he also worked . &quot;
he laughs only and I heard that to wear him .
&quot; the other women have not completely heard with it , but my ; they are now in a better position to choose to wear it in some days . &quot;
for many women the discussion is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we are doing a trip in every discussion .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to make the women worry who what could hear , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in their life they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and s@@ angen , and spoke about things that they had never thought of before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years , and yet I have had about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are knot@@ ted to our sp@@ ouses , have never been so honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things out loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion , we are talking about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing . &quot;
some women in the group have only worn Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most is it &apos;s okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ was Kur@@ ta to carry a broad shirt over a p@@ ants ; they did not have a drunk . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of your own clothes , mor@@ als are connected with the Sar@@ is and much more , ador@@ ned Roh@@ ini her own pair of cur@@ rants ( upper shirts ) into a discussion , so that the women could carry them . &quot;
&quot; next they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is for sure they will create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether in the five months have already been changed since their first panel , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things slowly come into roles : &quot;
we have made only small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then listened to the name of their sp@@ ouses . &quot;
&quot; some , including myself , make it still , but only if they are alone and no other family members are included . &quot;
only one or two will continue to say the name of her spouse ; only one or two women carry now at any time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot at their forehead .
&quot; the women in the discussion , know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as the fe@@ ast@@ ed around more freedom of movement , or the own clothes @-@ selection - at the end of a difficult to navigate . &quot;
&quot; by giving each other self confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
but this club each of us gives us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not just limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when each woman is coming home and other people about what we talk about and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the fall of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ person is rejected , however , whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to enable Li@@ u in foreign countries . &quot;
Norway
Nor@@ ens Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway was gr@@ asp@@ ed to Li@@ u after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government confirmed that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
diplomatic relations were continued only in December last year . only in June signed the Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon and exports to China since the exports since 2010 were largely blocked .
after the news that Li@@ u had seriously fallen ill that Li@@ u brought his hope for a unconditional release of expression and lu@@ d Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
&quot; due to his det@@ ention , he was not able to take his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution where China was asked to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and permit him to seek medical assistance , where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the peak of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us as well as for the release of Li@@ us on the 30th June . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we anticip@@ ate that China lifts all the limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; you should meet and receive all the visits you wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
USA
&quot; us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ el shared with that the Americans would like him , that he has the opportunity to treat abroad because he may help him with his gen@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a speaker of the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Poll@@ ey , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June , that the message provided the Chinese authorities to free not only Li@@ u , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the invitation of the U.S. message moved to an angry response from China , with the exterior of the State Department that &quot; no country have the right to inter@@ fere and ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
poll@@ ey shared with that China should offer the couple :
&quot; protection and freedom such as travel and access to medical care of its choice , to which they entitled according to Chinese constitution and legal systems , as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Mer@@ kl@@ ey and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to push the Chinese government to supp@@ ress Li@@ u and his wife uncondi@@ tionally . &quot;
I urge China to allow the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o uncondi@@ tionally so that he can go into a proper medical treatment . http : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; the German Government Steff@@ en Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u assumes all of the medical support he needed &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President of Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing of the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns , whether the vor@@ tex at Li@@ u could over@@ sees the visit in Hamburg . &quot;
Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China requested to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to provide themselves with his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us An@@ cher told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , who could visit him every day , but the police are always monitoring the room in the hospital and that it &apos;s not permitted with someone outside , including its lawyers to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells more :
&quot; Canada calls for China to commit its international human rights obligation , including freedom of expression , and to release them for the exercise of these rights violations . &quot;
France
France &apos;s Foreign Office called for China to release on 29 June to Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o all treatments will receive , which he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and family will contact him . &quot;
&quot; although the news station of France has already reported that the French Government Li@@ u would welcome the State of Li@@ u , the State Department announced that there will be no further information if France will finally record it . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Fi@@ bers in Taiwan called on 27 June on 27 June , Li@@ u , and to show a greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to pursue political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the Tai@@ w@@ anese leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Party ( Progressive Party ) also called for China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to let themselves treat in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned with Li@@ u on 28 June at Li@@ u , and gave many him to pray for Li@@ us wellness . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives that he took and for which he was strict pun@@ ished , to a harmon@@ ious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moved and encouraged than I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and the rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may be stupid as Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Federal Minister K. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , Singapore was considered to be a city . &quot;
this observation has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osph@@ ere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the An@@ walts@@ kammer Association of the State New York , the Minister expressed that many people criti@@ ci@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared with other countries . &quot;
he ass@@ ass@@ ed that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... nobody has questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; the logic to rot@@ ate &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , according to all our efforts and sacrific@@ es , to create this valuable country , you can say that we are not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the sem@@ bl@@ ance of escape from responsibilities to a mandatory injury . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , to eat country , is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons proposed by Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended one idea , according to which one cannot measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , given that it seemed inev@@ itably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York should be compared to the same cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the core point of the theme , the good old cor@@ pus@@ hes of the author@@ itarian rulers appear to be Democrats , leaving the pi@@ vot@@ al logic , as they fit better for their power . &quot;
&quot; in the final week , the responses of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am were given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our Ju@@ dic@@ atives , our political system really non @-@ responses . &quot;
corresponding questions answered with non @-@ responses ration@@ ales .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , to illustrate his opinion , since they did not understand this conclusion . &quot;
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , thus to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our week@@ s@@ K Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take the trouble to clarify this point unless he was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by continuing his comment on the blog , he has to read about the reviews that one should begin to read the entire co @-@ ordin@@ ates of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , according to which Singapore was a city and not a country . &quot;
read the con@@ scription .
&quot; as he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore was so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he lived in Singapore with cities in the U.S. ( and how many of these cities saw a party in decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said , Singapore , &quot; was not a country , &quot; he obviously does not believe it in this sense ! &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am who makes as leader of a her@@ etic generation that makes such pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
&quot; I am talking about what the Justice Minister of Singapore has said , very embarrass@@ ed ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , which I expect to do with them or not , but this is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes that he really is , and aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review submitted the weakness of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ ams reason@@ ing :
did Mr. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; good a mistake &quot; or was it a fre@@ ud@@ der speaker ?
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , to which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city . &quot;
&quot; as he plays an important role within the office , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am is of severe importance . &quot;
&quot; why are the Lon@@ urer for their military service , but they only defend their city but do not defend its country ? &quot;
whom must our Prime Minister pay back ?
what is the value of our pink staff ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city : &quot;
&quot; I have not said , what I said ... &quot;
this proposition seems to have anno@@ yed many different styles ...
nobody ever has said that Singapore is a country .
we always were a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; defense of the country especially &quot; etc . , but this is not quite true . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Can@@ adi@@ ers &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Fl@@ anders .
screens@@ hot of a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his speakers : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect about your residence or home country ?
&quot; your answers will be published here as part of a continuous series , with the rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et is to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question which is made to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , sorry , I will answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . I have lived from Canada , and I am living in Japan again since 1994 . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered to be polite , interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , the standard rep@@ ains : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hock@@ ey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans may perhaps inn@@ ess before bed@@ ut when they are held for Americans , but don &apos;t distur@@ b me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans of Americans . &quot;
&quot; this is one of the reasons , why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans can bring a Canadian flag well to their back@@ pack if they are leaving . &quot;
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans are on the other hand ...
&quot; so it was already when I started travelling 20 years ago - by Donald Tru@@ mp , before the march in Iraq and September 11 . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always worn little a@@ hor@@ ts at their luggage to distinguish themselves from their american neighbors .
we have a free health care !
with us there is no weapons !
gender equality have already been legal in Canada for 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are polite .
&quot; we are apparently very often &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the toler@@ ant country compared to ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , which I admired . &quot;
there would be nothing if you would change me for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; but there are also some problems with the p@@ unch &quot; &quot; nice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; firstly : as &quot; nice &quot; to be referred to , is basically to be sp@@ y - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has one &apos;s own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem exists in that &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing , where you can come across . &quot;
harmless to be un@@ ob@@ tr@@ usive and un@@ interesting and no attention deserve .
&quot; this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , remote away from the things that happen around a world . &quot;
&quot; I would even go far as far as to say , that the desire to be free and alone , a leading part of Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own matters .
&quot; what respect as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with neighbours .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now have with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , J@@ ustin Tru@@ de@@ au , then J@@ ustin Tru@@ de@@ au , the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice &quot; . &quot; our Prime Minister has made Canada straight to sexy . &quot;
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ an Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a music video released in Thailand , released a music video which thre@@ aten the Jun@@ ta , which is the power seized and in spite of their inter@@ speaking the civilian government , continue to re@@ igns the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him his girlfriend his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; although not explicitly politically , the music video refers to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video about the song was a huge success .
&quot; only within the first three days , this was divided on Facebook top loaded Video 1,@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The dict@@ ator was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists called the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction into the Thai policy , in particular how it beh@@ aves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
take a look at these recordings of the video which relate to some of the political issues affecting Thailand in the past three years .
&quot; the &quot; 44 Reg@@ ulations of the girls &quot; may refer to the dr@@ ak@@ onian section 44 of the provisional Constitution , which makes absolute decision @-@ making authority over important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; changing your attitude &quot; refers to the &quot; &quot; setting change &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are regarded by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime against its v@@ ague and un@@ clear regulations often used by authorities to defend activists and other critics of the state .
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , super@@ vised the online content and individuals who accused the monarchy , will be prosec@@ uted , prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand is set up a strike against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( majest@@ y ) .
on 20 May 2014 the war was established in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup in the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to be pursued is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ marine boats , although security experts they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax funds . &quot;
&quot; in the video , the video is even shown how people can be thrown into a black shipment camp before entering into an interim period , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists sit in prison , because it alleg@@ edly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users will attack a long arrest attack , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song members of the band who used the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch @-@ opponents during protests in 2014 . &quot;

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war company recovered only very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now more than 20 years have passed since the Georgian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ astic war has been officially completed , but his sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show marked images .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbon@@ ic of Ab@@ ch@@ antasi@@ es . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , sh@@ am@@ ans , Geor@@ gier and Armen@@ ians , and worked in the area along the sovi@@ ets in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , the main part of Russians and ch@@ ases are living in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also named in Ab@@ ch@@ antasi@@ es and Gei@@ ster@@ cities .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here today , there are only few hundred people in these cities . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 the total population of the district of 16.@@ 000 people , after having barely clim@@ bed over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 43.@@ 000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ stor@@ ey residential buildings of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ chev , are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are isolated and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local old man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult to end this .
&quot; this is all a result of war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is still unique . &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with infl@@ atable splend@@ or buildings .
&quot; people who once lived on this place and have made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have now abandoned the district . &quot;
in the Gei@@ ster@@ stadt D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha lived about fifty inhabitants .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages , it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ ush@@ chev &apos;s ow@@ ls , which are still one or two families , one recogni@@ zes to the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately go back . &quot;
&quot; our mother is forbidden to let us photograph , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it was just forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers her girlfriend something to and suddenly they left the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small tur@@ qu@@ oise mining company called T@@ ku@@ ali@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ si@@ sten@@ z@@ wirtschaft ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ demand ) such as zo@@ ot@@ echni@@ cs and be@@ asts .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
the district administration offers free candles and bread in winter for free .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what is going to happen , but we will build Zu@@ c@@ chini &quot;

&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France in France , Gal@@ ina has not left un@@ f@@ antasi@@ es to live with her . &quot; &quot; my heart will remain in Ab@@ le Asia , &quot; &quot; tells them . &quot;
Gal@@ ina would like to accept financial aid by her daughter and insi@@ sted that she has assisted her young grand@@ children .
Gal@@ inas monthly pensions are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot;

in Mexico is home &quot; Mama Africa &quot; migrants on their long journey

this article by Amy Br@@ acken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants to cross Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Wall@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mex@@ ic@@ ress to a small woman with a cor@@ all @-@ pink glasses and g@@ ild@@ ed ear@@ rings rings in Ted@@ dy@@ b@@ arian form .
&quot; it is known as Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa . &quot;
&quot; this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tian , who are on the journey . &quot;
the hotel does not have any charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with ground @-@ round walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants are coming here .
&quot; sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells people in full mini@@ buses and the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; Mama Africa &quot;
where are you m@@ um Africa ? &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
there are only 24 rooms and some have already slept outside on cardboard boxes .
it would not like to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and bring them to hospital when they are sick , they buy them medicines that they cannot pay , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ sam , which stir@@ red by the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived at a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if mom &apos;s Africa was a reasonable @-@ name for Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ beard ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .

&quot; yes , yes , I reply with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her , because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and three children .
&quot; you have lived in Brazil for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States , to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had been hearing from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the circuit , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
&quot; he tells that Hai@@ tian &apos;s and Afri@@ cans often travel the way together , and that Afri@@ cans already speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil before in Brazil and worked as a construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup Championship . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he s@@ ells SI@@ M cards to save the necessary money to buy the B@@ usti@@ ft after Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave them again , &quot; &quot; he smiling . &quot; &quot; we will always stay in contact . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez told that their guests will often send their text message when they continued to gr@@ ading them , or to report her about the course of their journey . &quot;
she explains that her Christian faith in the drive of their work is .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have brought their cro@@ issants as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but she is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Wall@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
&quot; in this winter , Valencia and his family have received migrants in their little house . &quot;
it is a polic@@ eman and has found that the B@@ usti@@ ckets are sold to many African migrants to be too expensive .
&quot; he began to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night offered . &quot;
&quot; at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tian . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blankets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a kitchenette . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I have crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
&quot; there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
&quot; after he lived for three years , he was transferred from the United States after a raid on his work place . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants travels through Wall@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that he was flying in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to squee@@ ze money from him without having a plan .
&quot; in tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and a well @-@ known , a single @-@ moving one , has offered him its roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later the family lives still there , and they tried to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses the passengers consult their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests to a large part of Somalia .
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that their house is full , but it is also no@@ stal@@ gic , because of those who have gone . &quot;
as a proud grand@@ mother le@@ aved them in her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair @-@ true that you made a customer , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and Old . &quot;
they are sad while they told me briefly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; repeated them every time . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install on their mobile phones a surveillance app .
a Check @-@ Point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang von Twitter @-@ User Rec@@ ording .
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in the West of China , are comp@@ elled to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on 10 July the phone users at the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city of Uru@@ m@@ qi is a cell alert , in which it points to the district government called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the message is said that the app should prevent access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities should also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia were arrested 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they had already installed the app , with a private We@@ chat Group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police stood that the app would determine the sources and distribution of terrorists , and follow the &quot; &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system @-@ categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ vo@@ u Tel@@ ecom .
&quot; the main function is the block@@ ade porno@@ graphic web pages , by online fraud , Tro@@ jan and ph@@ ishing pages to make users attentive to how much time they spend online , and to control their own home network . &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ ackers are able to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or to ste@@ al it . &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures to take control of the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reports on digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often gri@@ ster@@ ous for those working in remote , dr@@ ang@@ ed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme tick @-@ acids and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ous Internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; based on Twitter @-@ based media out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( the time being released ) , publishing news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point , at the polic@@ emen as a result , whether they had been installed the surveillance App . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required that people will install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without these software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; you have comp@@ elled the people to use devices that are designed for older people , too . &quot;
this is a form of cap@@ tivity by the compl@@ ementary technology .
we are back in ma@@ os China again .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( it is the time being released ) , and also published an J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang Product description , from which the software can lift up the password of a Windows operating system , allowing full access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang Computer and Hand@@ ys in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic Hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may have a response to the instructions of the city &apos;s Party , to minimize the spread of illegal content . &quot;
&quot; all government officials , public authorities and with the party connected institutions including universities and research institutes are oblig@@ ated to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office when operating their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current report by Freedom House , a US American human rights organisation , mentioned also these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities released on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi . a regulation with the statement on all residents and entrepreneurs , until 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , phones , external drives , portable hard@@ disk drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards to register with the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; however , however , the personality rights of Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for quite a number of other possible ex@@ ams , including such that relate to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
sleep or death ; part 1 : all shop@@ pers to death
one single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
Foto by : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ cli@@ more ( CC BY 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane signs his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and stand firm that you are all alone in one place in which all matters are gone . &quot;
&quot; everything has changed after and after dis@@ solved and a truth , which is clearly recognizable , both from inside and outside . &quot;
one who makes their name all glory .
one who has be@@ aten himself into a list of emotions and expressions that do not allow Met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when you get the reality once again , and you behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and the performers - turn the characters into being of flesh and blood , and all sh@@ outing after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubt solve themselves in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even if the earth is tr@@ apped on the axis of the hei@@ ls . you realize that you are caught up between the walls that your parents , and before them your grandparents , stone was built . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my Father three times , but that was not yet so I mean &quot; my lecture &quot; , &quot; as the boss of the security officer , it form@@ ulate - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he presented his power over us by adding even the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
&quot; five young people were destroyed during a peaceful protest , such as weed from the beautiful garden of our revolution . &quot;
&quot; it is composed , so that the city filled the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; Ol@@ ite &quot; &quot; scre@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; all the districts , only my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , rainy , at the wrong time , even if I didn &apos;t make high demands on a city that is st@@ alled up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had lost some cal@@ ms after the power supply of the quarter . &quot;
&quot; I broke the silence by being attacked several times &quot; &quot; ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; from my house @-@ ach . &quot;
I heard my voice through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to gather together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we set up to a beautiful image , which filled my expectations full and completely . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you realize that you free the mind from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in straight . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my Father : &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he put on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give your voice back , after you turned it all the way up to the office of the safety service from the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
the Upper Gh@@ assan was there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I now too .
&quot; the Upper Gh@@ assan begins to speak : &quot; &quot; also listen to me , as thou &apos;@@ ahu is sh@@ red@@ able , or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am when we are not nearby . &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ ted eyes were on me .
&quot; and you sad , what to look in the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot;
&quot; what I did , has nothing to do with courage . &quot;
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot;
&quot; maybe it was on my door@@ man , it@@ eness ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure I answered my thing as I answered : &quot; I did not think that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I never stopped to look at your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; and he is in sol@@ itary , and his father immediately with them . &quot;
&quot; his father equal to them , too . &quot;
the sten@@ ance of this ver@@ flu@@ ence of this set is up to now in the nose .
&quot; he was subjected to a &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a se@@ el@@ ian torture , which I was abandoned monthly . &quot;
I crosses the farm .
in the first office I &apos;ll let everything I carry with me .
&quot; afterwards , through the court and into the second office , which leads through a course to the single cells . &quot;
I give myself all the details exactly what I support the room .
otherwise they probably have a larger cell to me this time .
&quot; I have to share it with only one another prison@@ er , and let me immediately put me on their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I hold back to an old @-@ established communication method : with the f@@ ist to beat the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell @-@ cell is a &quot; awakening . &quot;
&quot; after a long hes@@ itation , he answered me ultimately . &quot;
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells was a rep@@ utable man middle age that looks like me and called &quot; doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness , no mark@@ ers can be seen in me , and doctors are not here ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice is similar to mine ? &quot;
all the answers are connected to its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the great cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ators had insured me , they would leave him fre@@ ed if I stay . &quot;
li@@ ar .
&quot; I would like to have had a bird @-@ h@@ itch to exp@@ el all these mo@@ wing , who lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
from the distance I hear it still &quot; The ahu . &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always , at this time the scre@@ ams , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that Black saw the color of the verb , until I saw the yellow light that gave us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; &quot; Donn@@ er &quot; , &quot; written on 13 S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
they are here to listen to .
&quot; this was the secret : to protect the state security from us and prevent the terrorists in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - thus they also played their con@@ den@@ omin@@ ational view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , this is not a land ; it is a cur@@ se that they call co@@ existence to turn the crimin@@ als of their sound into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I support the squ@@ ir@@ cle and handles on Abu I@@ mad , a slim and armed man ; at least he comes to me so before . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can ex@@ clude so much more sp@@ inning with your life as you join this meeting and protest to demonstrations that will soon find an end . &quot;
I did not rep@@ lied .
I used it acc@@ ust@@ omed to answer .
I really can &apos;t say more exactly when insul@@ ts and blo@@ ws have become a friendly conversation for me to an ordinary communication .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said I had to get used to be pun@@ ished , pun@@ ished , although I had nothing to make this punishment . &quot;
an punishment in all their variety .
its command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he is called the lovingly called &quot; conc@@ ession . &quot;
&quot; it starts with a plastic pipe , which probably comes from the clo@@ ak . &quot;
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ iced in your scre@@ ams .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him and you cannot with@@ hold your horror . &quot;
&quot; my fri@@ ght made him not enough , why they exchange the tube by a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first contro@@ versy , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked before as a gar@@ bage dump or if that belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables connected to each other to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a giant cable . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour , three of them were changed , while I was still on the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost all feeling inside my body - and also my voice , so I listened to scre@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noted the cooling , and found no vessel at all because he came to an electric loaded rod . &quot;
flow through my entire body enough to feed my whole neighborhood .
&quot; my semi @-@ nude body , the stretched on the ground was the perfect flow leader . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided he had met his duty for this night .
it has to have been like midnight .
&quot; I decided to sleep again , let &apos;s say , let &apos;s say that was my only option . &quot;
&quot; some hours went , which came to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call for the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the light fills the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I answered with the voice of a drunk young : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fear@@ ful worries . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and be@@ away you , you will be vict@@ orious . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the j@@ ord@@ anic Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , on the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b spends the bulk of his time inside , sometimes he sm@@ ears to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , back and again to his couch . &quot;
&quot; but to what one can leave , is a cigarette between his fingers or his with ni@@ cot@@ ine lips . &quot;
&quot; he lives in the top of his family house , which had belonged to them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel was completed his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had forced to escape from their village in Palestine , in which she lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; now H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is an im@@ passion@@ ed activ@@ ist who confron@@ ts the conservative majority and expressed their old opinions about gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , but also calls for the core of the whole Arab world . all these topics are not only in its hom@@ etown of Am@@ man relevance , but also in cities that suff@@ ice from Damascus to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is restricted in his mind by borders , and he can feel loud with people who suffer the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not open it openly , he had a special desc@@ end against the American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war @-@ areas , something that he was born with his identity as &quot; Palestinian @-@ whis@@ per@@ ed of the second generation , &quot; even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own life circumstances , &quot; says H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I &apos;m a man , while he was sol@@ dered in waters of the nett@@ les . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan ; in that time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise to sun@@ down . &quot;
the current law also stresses that public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a sen@@ sel@@ fish hot j@@ it@@ ag has little with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the pressures of a warm coffee and the sw@@ ans of the K@@ ent cigarette on the nose is primarily of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when looking at a glance into the neighboring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore avo@@ ids just avo@@ ids just to do fundamental things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan Water , to not land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the interior of Jord@@ an@@ onia has announced a appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time already . &quot;
&quot; some MPs , which support the Islamic Chron@@ icle by the Islamic branch of the Muslim Br@@ otherhood - ar@@ gues that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual fron@@ ts of Ham@@ ed sensu@@ al , the cultural and traditional norms of the country contradi@@ cts and the main reason for the concert . &quot;
&quot; the MP and former press conference in the Islamic coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert &quot; &quot; had been cancelled &quot; &quot; due to the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many believe that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world was more dangerous activ@@ ism , which represents the old proven legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la presents the j@@ ord@@ anic people as a &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights &quot; , &quot; which continued to stand for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement probably should not be simply wi@@ ped rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but actually a clear @-@ clear reality in Jordan , which clearly expresses in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
in 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional genital or@@ men to cor@@ pse by having placed his vision of the fate arab@@ ic women to have pre @-@ marriage sex .
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a clearly lower @-@ known woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , Jordan has increased the number of &apos; Hon@@ orary mor@@ de &apos; , the in@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch the number of hon@@ orary mor@@ de in 2016 has reached its peak ; however , the institutional infrastructure is still missing to support women who tried victims and domestic violence to be appropriate . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on fighting control from 1954 women , women are exposed to in@@ viol@@ ated violence , and for its release is often a years of bureaucr@@ atic effort , as well as the guarantee of the family that the woman has nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; even H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known , not to shy back in his country long as tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b openly argue that his work is political , however , that he is his music that is full of explicit assu@@ mp@@ tions to sexuality , freedom and expression , not separate policies . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , Mann . &quot;
&quot; I was arrested , politics , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
&quot; in &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of songs that are politically politically , can be continued . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is often repeated :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , on which one can get in his words , what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , p@@ eter@@ o- or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan were talking about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ individuals were still firmly ens@@ ored in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b led an interview for the popular J@@ ord@@ anic Onlin@@ e@@ Programme Ro@@ ya , to later realize that his comments were cr@@ amped from the context , and in his opinion were c@@ ens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but was only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b acqu@@ ires H@@ d@@ ai@@ b open for the arab@@ ic T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als did not un@@ fold in the Islam .
&quot; he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who has remained in memory today thanks to its hom@@ o@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : when Abu Nu@@ what was to work later on behalf of the pot@@ assi@@ sts , in the eighth century could be open to homosexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ an@@ ier not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic Kingdom , it is nothing new that government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are being sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ anic message service took place several former government officials and members of the teacher @-@ association with the ration@@ ale they would have expressed critical about the problems in social media with deep @-@ ro@@ oting corruption that are deeply rooted in the land . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs believes that only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ier . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is a constant giving and take . Jord@@ anian has devast@@ ated a show , but the path of progress - there is H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , bed@@ ding and inner changes . it is certain that these changes take place from day to day at the heart of the j@@ ord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; finally , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs , even , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dreams not only dreams of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will deal with music , art and literature a genuine and basic openness - and not by bom@@ bs , stre@@ um@@ uni@@ tions and in artificial nature . at least , he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until it is , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue , and therefore also resistance . &quot;
this report was made by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Repor@@ ting to which A@@ man is heard as Student Fellow .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three largest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these big , ex@@ travag@@ ant warri@@ ors are as fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festivals .
&quot; you susp@@ ect that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ ists . another theory means that the strongh@@ olds , the drums and the t@@ ances were over more than one thousand years , in the armies from the west of Japan in the northeast mar@@ ched , to force the indigenous people of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , into the knee . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to get some great seats out , that &apos;s why we have a superb view . &quot;
it can be difficult to imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I looked at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en once again for a long time : two cars are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true way to spend their summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .

&quot; rarely , external appearance and body maintenance were as important as in this story , for they help preserve the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and maintain a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dres@@ sers . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , located near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where road smoking and illegal drug trading are daily . &quot;
&quot; in April 2017 , survey revealed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe . &quot;
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
&quot; the trend , the appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ esis ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has resulted in creating more norm@@ alities in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can make these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , who go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even an annual event inspired , the competition of the hair@@ s &quot; Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os &quot; , &quot; which has held since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there you enter experts against each other , to show who by them can create the ex@@ centr@@ ist L@@ ooks , as one can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school of August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , who found themselves in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to get young people out of it , take their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of poor advice to get a training in the hair@@ dressing art which allows them to find work . &quot;
motivated by this activity and the bid@@ der possibilities have seen do@@ zens of young people that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops especially in March starting in March and reported some of their achievements :
&quot; 1995 we were the only school in the community and the district , which we are very proud , because from love for the children we have built this educational community . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; &quot; love message to guer@@ ri@@ lla warri@@ ors , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to men who we know ?
&quot; is it not yet much more important , people who feel exhausted , affection ? &quot;
&quot; this question was just about the two young Colom@@ bian activists from the foundation of Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os by the Young Youth Youth Foundation , not out of the head and inspired it to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ ci@@ li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters for reconciliation ) , the young people ex@@ iles to write Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ iter@@ bo letters . &quot;
&quot; recently in short , her land of a historic event , and they wanted to contribute their part to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ descent F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) , which forms the closing of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; international was considered the under@@ mark of the peace process as so significant , that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos has received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; however , in front of the Colom@@ bian , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters that have lived for many years have been exposed in illegal wareh@@ ouses , and round the clock with their weapons , must now be integrated into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , who had acc@@ ust@@ omed to life in constant fear and in some cases to get deep hat@@ red against guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare that now needs to be in its ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young colum@@ bi@@ ans would have to close together and help in integration process .
and that is exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love message to former Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ler to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former casting fighters - which will then be handed over to personally .
the Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters of reconciliation was born on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , who took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there was Leonardo and Cr@@ istian the opportunity to speak briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ th@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this stated that we love the people , who love to write on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day of thousands of love , but those forgotten that they need much more unnecessary . &quot;
&quot; he tar@@ pau@@ lin , he told his love for sharing his love with people who needed the most urgent addition . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the plan , letters , full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and have to build up a new life . &quot; the letters are prepared to make the discourse from a war history to a common history of peace . &quot;
&quot; so far , in the framework of the campaign more than 2000 letters were collected . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities Colom@@ bian such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ ic@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
I have never thought that someone would be granted
the first 500 letters were passed on 19 March in one of the UN warehouse area in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca .
&quot; a group of 40 students of the University of J@@ aver@@ iana takes place in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the foundation of Bog@@ ot@@ ene in the camp to get the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC presented itself as they had done earlier to take the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they did not have prec@@ epts , but letters full of under@@ growth of people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that is in between &quot; , &quot; told the policy @-@ President Manuela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a employee of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , giving you this unforgettable experience as follows : &quot;
&quot; after we had handed over the letters , a former fighter took me through the camp of the Gu@@ er@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; ( a sort of hut that live in the guer@@ ri@@ ler ) , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ ler that wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , because beside him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ cher , a deadly weapon in the thor@@ ns . &quot;
&quot; I said to him anyway , and asked : &quot; &quot; hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; I answered a letter that someone has written me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone has written me a little so beautiful , so I answered it . &quot;
I h@@ ug@@ ged him very firmly and put me next to the pom@@ eg@@ ers .
&quot; maybe he was also the war , I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life as war . to join the F@@ ARC , was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before hunger . &quot; I have never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is a society out there , with open arms waiting for us . &quot;
&quot; until now , I have only learned how to handle weapons with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace prev@@ ails , I can learn a lot of things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; to the opening , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already celebrated in the dark .
&quot; the leaders of the F@@ ARC is the history of the organization , its ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years , we have experienced the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this order , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; these people hear who had never seen hearing yet and had no electoral law , and to recognize that people who have often seen as mon@@ ster and even hate , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; reality , in which the country lives , does me sore . &quot;
&quot; but it comfort@@ ed me that all men - including those who have killed and so much damage to us , and give us a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the com@@ mander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the City of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bian has been made that after the dis@@ armament peace will reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there are inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to rise up and to protest to their rights , and that is completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we from the F@@ ARC now put on peace , to a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore we call all def@@ enders of peace on - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong to themselves - to collect about all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifice , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend the life as the basis of existence will be many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; it follows the translation of an article , which was draf@@ ted by uns@@ rem Partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ su@@ mo@@ wa and its first release on the OC Media . &quot;
&quot; homosexu@@ als and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and corruption . &quot;
with horror activists have experienced the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that depends on how a D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ sm@@ ite is dependent on the local LGB@@ T@@ Q community not only appeared overnight .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of their experiences with us and talked with us what happened in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legislation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines after several months , after reports have been published , reve@@ aling torture and killing que@@ er men in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ ash@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the suspic@@ ious que@@ er men forti@@ fications and recorded them in secret pr@@ isons in Ar@@ gun st@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; you have brought a mon@@ ster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sabrina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when she became growing , her was aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced their land lady , the hunt was opened to Sabrina . &quot;
they fear for their lives in the end of the end of the USA .
Sabrina : I was acting as volunteers in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of Dag@@ est@@ an , a Trans@@ woman who raised in difficulties . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I accepted her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , made someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . therefore , there is no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
then the photos of my documents made by the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was right there , a few shopping mile from the back of my car , I heard a male voice said , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned , I feel something in my body , but I did nothing hur@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; then I heard one sentence , but this time on the Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long do you still want to honor the family , thou sh@@ outing ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and aw@@ oke in the hospital again .
apparently some women had to get everything and begin to scre@@ am .
the man was flo@@ wn .
women had called a ambulance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two reporting in my right lung .
OC Media : in which health care were you laid - in men or women ?
&quot; Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated , there my male name is still standing , but the doctor understood and laid me for the women . &quot;
so I am very thankful for him .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got to do with fear ; it was a Muslim , a caffeine name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he is respectful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
in the last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was attended by neighbours and some remote relatives .
&quot; the demanded to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove , that all this is a lie . &quot;
&quot; they presented absur@@ de demands : some said to me , I say it to the top without the streets ; others wanted that I had not changed my sex in the official television in Gros@@ ny , and I say that I was not just Schl@@ ech@@ tre@@ ach , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have KÃ¶r@@ b@@ chen@@ size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for them .
some older men spoke once my mother on the streets .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a mon@@ ster to the world that is not just your family , but the entire Republic . &quot;
&quot; we can not sti@@ r you because you are a dev@@ out woman , but you need to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she placed himself a stri@@ ck around the neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later under the window a car with dis@@ kl@@ ed window plates and a number@@ ing sign with a 95 dr@@ on .
after the third time it happened was clear to me that there was something lazy .
my human right@@ ful friends check @-@ up the number@@ ing signs - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how are you flo@@ wn ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons I do not want to award their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then happened something nonsense . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SI@@ M card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without having to register without my credit , without everything . &quot;
&quot; I broke my old SI@@ M card , and cast them into the gar@@ bage . &quot;
came to and checks in the hotel .
the number was on a stran@@ ger .
I put the SI@@ M card into my mobile phone .
&quot; in the moment when I want to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you do not believe in security , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
&quot; our people already know , in which hotel you do not . you even know your room number . &quot;
&quot; only to prove it , it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still get in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about the gender equality , however , this is a tabby theme . &quot;
some traditional k@@ au@@ kas@@ y elements I still wear in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , this se@@ ental barrier can I do not overcome . &quot;
&quot; I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we ch@@ atting with camera , I actually give me effort to see how the person watch out of her past - thus to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what are your friends , those who are dor@@ sal ? &quot;
Sabrina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the needed I needed current information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; I talked with someone , the one and a half @-@ month in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait and he did not lock a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; I mean , they probably load the relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced through blood pleasures . &quot;
OC Media : are now even more pregnant men in this secrecy ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says it would not be very many .
&quot; if , then especially those who have no rich relative or were dropped off by their relatives , to put himself Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be held there , so that you can present them later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be killed , one will show their bodies on TV and claim them , they could have attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people are not just gone , they are targeted , to radi@@ cal@@ alize . &quot;
OC Media : is it just a mut@@ ation or have you a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just have someone who was arrested one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard grew .
there has been nothing new of them since then .
they simply put them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself as these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; however , until now they were not presented as band@@ its , so far there were no reports . we susp@@ ect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why would one not have these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , &quot; already in the past ? &quot;
Sabrina : I always carried my hair up to long time .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I believe that in 2003 I was already known in Gros@@ ny as I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
in the Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to lead us to &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; but finally he was thrown back into the St@@ one@@ age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were exhausted ; I had colored eyelashes that contributed to Tu@@ be@@ je@@ ans and short t@@ ops .
the security of the sh@@ aria has never bent me only one hair .
&quot; before the Russian theater in Gros@@ ny , there was a place where every night , especially at weekends , a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several ben@@ ches were standing , and the whole city knew ; they knew why men , young people who met . &quot;
we were never off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a free speech : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that is said : &quot; Sp@@ otte not about the un@@ happiness of another . &quot;
it is often said to be children when the jack@@ et are fun .
&quot; OC Media : so they just have their eyes closed before you , because they believed , you are sick ? &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
&quot; they have never seen me , never h@@ unted , and never be@@ aten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace hold on ?
Sabrina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row appeared on the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister , he began to speak on TV about mor@@ als . &quot;
&quot; he spoke not about us , but priority about the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could sense how the people in the city began to change . &quot;
&quot; who had pun@@ ished and pun@@ ished , consider it at once with suspic@@ ion . &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel like the situation in the Republic is steadily wast@@ ed . &quot;
OC Media : what activities are you going to go now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much more than 700 to 800 dollars a month in the United States .
&quot; of this , I am still active as a activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize teac@@ re@@ ship , meetings , I watch them to the hospital and help them to get eating . &quot;
I have no c@@ ents for it .
I discovered these people myself when I ap@@ per@@ ched shelter .
&quot; I am Muslims , and I want to help those who need help . &quot;
OC Media : do you wear Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : this is advertis@@ ed .
&quot; so is nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to make you white with foam in front of the mouth , that there is no gay . &quot;
&quot; the Dag@@ est@@ ans have which , the cab@@ aret have what the Russians have , and on all the planet it is - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant to hear so what to hear . &quot;
I go here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
&quot; many of them - practicing Muslims , who go to the mosque and during the Ram@@ adan - live together with men . &quot;
&quot; you know , many think of transi@@ tional identity to men who love men , and they believe they might be sex to make more intimate experiences . but this is a trust . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different ways of sensation , to be exact , different habitats . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ash@@ amed for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry that I am here so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in self @-@ murder within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab ancestors community in Iran
the Iranian ancestors region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last months , there has been a strong increase in self @-@ murder . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27th , the des@@ perate situation of the Arab ancestors community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the South@@ wa@@ z region in the South@@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he sh@@ ou@@ trag@@ ed for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness that may arise in@@ capacity for his family , such as ancestors human rights groups who work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; a video shared on YouTube shared the moments after he had alli@@ ed himself , fixed . &quot;
&quot; some people managed to delete the fl@@ ames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ mad@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only su@@ ic@@ ide , who has occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists from place that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab B@@ ani Tam@@ im - attached . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : there were all family members , who , due to the persecution on the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and un@@ able to feed their families and to follow a safe work . &quot;
Arab ancestors suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a majority of Iran lived in Iran , the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community was sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult to deny the native Arab population to deny their living . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly aut@@ on@@ ome region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ monarchy took over power and 1925 large efforts made to finish ethnic autonomy in the whole of Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran in@@ coming oil and gas fields as well as some of the sublime and valuable commercial areas for the Iranian farming . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime denied the ancestors of the ancestors of systematic jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government also built a variety of lu@@ dges , built waters from the Arab areas into the Persian territories where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m . &quot;
these dam@@ s only led to devast@@ ate the devast@@ ation in the region and destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palms industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi youth rose up to 81 % now .
&quot; N@@ OUR Moh@@ ammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Consu@@ l Direc@@ tor@@ ate for co @-@ operative , labour and social welfare , announces that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who finished a job , completed 55 % a leading school , and 45 % holding a university degree . &quot;
a systematic strategy ... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an anti @-@ Nazi human rights activ@@ ist with resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices , that the current situation is a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination &quot; , &quot; a &quot; high increase in the number of self @-@ murder among young ancestors . &quot;
&quot; Doh@@ im@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become worse . reason is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z new to in@@ coming ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setup process : &quot;
&quot; as Func@@ tion@@ ists and institutions do not prefer to set Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi wants to move access to labor opportunities throughout all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of the national resistance of young Arabs , and to force them to make their livel@@ i@@ hood outside their homeland of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their predec@@ essors and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the ancestors , and so an@@ ed because even Arab names are not toler@@ ated in the workplace , because the speaking of the Arabic language or the Tr@@ agen arab@@ ic clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances , which have to end@@ ure the Arab ancestors , the human activ@@ ist alarm , before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world takes a lot of time and knowledge .

&quot; the following article is an edited version of the opinion that was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i , which was originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions came to express . &quot;
you can read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , acting many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even thought well through scientific and social arguments against me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , women nowadays still earn less money despite the same education as men . &quot;
that women are still under str@@ ingent observation when it comes to what they may do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms also make sure that women meet sooner or later in various areas of life to a smooth cover , and that discrimination based on sex still moves through the many different countries and fai@@ ths . &quot;
all of this is aware and well @-@ known .
I am convinced that I am living twice and thre@@ e@@ fold among them .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , if I come on skin colour , on racism , on black CIS women , on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a , or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a , or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , have to mention many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; but nevertheless all agree that women - all women - together should be able to sing &quot; their voices and sing &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing &apos; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence , an institution@@ alized forms of racial violence , which we are exposed to black women in two times . &quot;
&quot; in addition , black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and origin @-@ cities earn less than white men and women . &quot;
that black girls and girls are referred to as a white girl with a migration background than white girls .
&quot; or that women are exposed to a higher risk of women in black spheres , domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand I want all women , all men and all men each have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join me as black woman , in whose center the white woman is concerned , which refuse to take on the gender and the skin colour of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted and I will no longer fight for my membership in a white @-@ femin@@ ist sphere , who still rejected me and countless other black women ever . &quot;
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner def@@ endant 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is an in@@ humane and margin@@ alized beings . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join me group@@ ings , which also absor@@ b through cultural ex@@ propri@@ ation of our customs and customs , to drive their eg@@ oc@@ ent@@ ric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer seek to present white women the importance of abundance of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to in@@ vigor@@ ate them . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different heart information and to hide from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot;
&quot; I urge it to release me fully and entirely from femin@@ ism and to use the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which is used for my dark skin and my status as a woman who is so persistent , that Inter@@ sec@@ tional phenomenon is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it &apos;s more important than ever before , that we can define black women after our own ideas and embar@@ k into the spheres , created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ mus Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the Book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we can defend ourselves , in which they can defend ourselves and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered , which make the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will call immediately separ@@ atism and exclusion , after they read these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment , I can em@@ ate black women and women of other cultures , as it existed in this paradi@@ gm . &quot;
I will be recognized due to my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as a part of this paradi@@ gm .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ished in an environment where my life is not passed over , nor ignored . &quot;

&quot; Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kur@@ dist@@ an region of Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains us his relationship with the rivers and the impact of pollution to its parish .
&quot; I definitely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a says . &quot;
&quot; fear that scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of D@@ ams , the pollution and the un@@ controll@@ able development , lead to a direct water@@ crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO Water@@ ke@@ epers Iraq - an affiliate of Water@@ ke@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video Mus@@ a takes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question , &quot; If we don &apos;t have water any more , how would we survive then ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq , resident documentary fil@@ mer@@ ing and multi@@ medi@@ al journalist , produced , filmed and published . &quot;

Paraguay . women and their difficult struggle against violence
&quot; a group of women constitutes &quot; &quot; the wept women &quot; &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s mor@@ ays in the country and in the region and to show their ref@@ us@@ al . &quot;

the following article is the shorten@@ ed and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # ben@@ lich@@ ein@@ e@@ Women &apos;s ) that reported on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed for the protection of the people concerned .
&quot; a police miss@@ ary said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their expor@@ ters who had become violent against violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship was some time passed and the police said , her statement would be put to the acc@@ ents , but more could not do . &quot;
&quot; as a further wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena due to mis@@ management , used also the ak@@ es@@ kun@@ k display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez nothing . &quot;
a few days later the second woman moved their ad back .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women re@@ funding at all once , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also dependent on the males who abuse they . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit , victims of violence could be reported at all with the enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; content blo@@ ws and Statisti@@ cal 2 Un@@ visible mis@@ carriage and a judicial system , which is nothing under@@ ne@@ mm@@ ed 3 of Paraguay : good approach , lack of implementation and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to determine how many women are really mis@@ led , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , research scientist for Gen@@ der@@ issues at Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports , which , but not even ans@@ ed the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however the figures available are however very alar@@ ming .
&quot; in 2015 , at the District Apostles 9@@ 600 ads went on domestic violence in 2015 . at 70 % of this we went to violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the adver@@ ts in the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in peace studies . also , there were 86 % of the ads of women . &quot;
&quot; in the ads 40 % of women said that they were physically mis@@ led , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics show not the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to statements of the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Women minist@@ er Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; on any woman who are re@@ imb@@ urs@@ ed in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic failure , 9 women do not do this . &quot;
&quot; every woman , which will be re@@ funded because of physical abuse , two women who do not do this &quot; , &quot; she stated at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; as women &apos;s su@@ ic@@ ide in Paraguay is not an own crimes , the enforcement authorities may not be adequately documented how many women are mur@@ dered each year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; only until August 2016 , journalists least 12 cases of women &apos;s ic@@ ide in the country alone . &quot;
the coordin@@ ator of human rights in Paraguay have documented at least 37 cases in which women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
&quot; after its estimates , in Paraguay all ten days a woman died due to violence by men . &quot;

&quot; invisible fail@@ ures and a judicial system , which does not take up anything . &quot;
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera was , he insi@@ sted that she called his name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she did not want it , but there was still . this should regret it forever . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana 28 years old and no longer worked together with Carlos . but two years she carried the psych@@ ic violence in turn - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time , most recognizable : &quot;
I have never thought that I would have been victim of abuse .
&quot; if I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women happen to be sub@@ mis@@ sive because they can f@@ ool of violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , they wrote articles on Facebook , in which they described his off@@ ences and various attacks throughout their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had them isolated . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic if he ever raised the hand against them , and refused to conf@@ ess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen so long by Carlos and left him earlier . &quot;
&quot; it seemed almost so , as they wanted to say that victims of mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ations at least had a certain blame for it . &quot;
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , which comes not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner will be mis@@ led . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consist of women all in any way victims of abuse .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences to listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic error .
&quot; their wealthy partner even managed to convince her , that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as indicators in authorities stayed without a result and also of their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; she carried out a process against their former partners who developed into a vulnerable legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of their former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays La@@ ws : good approach to lack of realization
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not used . &quot;
&quot; the ad &apos;s ad is a path of resistance and a struggle against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great issues in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill introduced a bill that was known under the has@@ ht@@ ag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # FÃ¼r@@ th ) . &quot;
this has@@ ht@@ ag and the Movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ mon@@ e@@ Less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International .
the original design of the law seems to explain to a peculi@@ ar crime continu@@ ance and harder to pun@@ ish as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; so the bill text changes in a number of points to also win the MEPs to the law , who feared that the path for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions used to be pun@@ ished in Paraguay and will be pun@@ ished by up to five years in prison . &quot;
&quot; the original la@@ wl@@ essness had intended to carry out most of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) process costs , which have to bear the victims of violence currently , if they just want to re@@ funding and maintain a safe accommodation , to aband@@ on the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective unless the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure does not provide adequate financial resources for it : &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , mis@@ management is seen as a part inter@@ human relationships . &quot;
&quot; here a circum@@ stance should take place , so that force is not considered to be something normal . &quot;
&quot; who is speaking of these facts , is involved guilty and contributes to the perpet@@ rators of criminal off@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need to be re@@ funding as long as the abuse is no longer regarded as normal . &quot;
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the law Senate . previously , parts of the law had been changed . however , among other things , a passage was kn@@ itted to the partners in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions on the changes are concerned .
&quot; the section regarding reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for ag@@ gres@@ sor , to attack his sacrifice . &quot;
&quot; the strings of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law shall be considered a big return . &quot;

independent media in O@@ man continues to ban a newspaper after the ban on paper
&quot; this website was locked due to a decision to read the information Department , &quot; read the Az@@ am@@ n website on the homepage of the published newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
more than a year ago the om@@ anic authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sult@@ an .
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he is a one year old prison . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and placed before judgment , but later returned . &quot;
&quot; O@@ man has been governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power after he had his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , by a state . &quot;
&quot; since then he ar@@ ra@@ yed by his role as the sole Sultan , the most important minist@@ ries in the country : Prime Minister , Defense Minister , Ober@@ ster command@@ ing owner of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Minister of the Supreme Council for the planning and president of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the domination of the sult@@ ans is marked by the per@@ sever@@ ing efforts of security forces , in particular the domestic secrets , public freedoms , including press freedom , regulation and more activists , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists , in@@ timi@@ d and det@@ ention . &quot;
&quot; the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights , and hin@@ der citizens , also activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , their closing and det@@ ention three of their editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its inc@@ eption 2007 has been reported on corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) , until it was forbidden by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Che@@ ese @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , firm , after the newspaper on 26 July 2016 was released an article entitled &apos; high @-@ level parties &apos; hands of the judiciary . in this , it went to corruption in judicial proceedings and the intervention of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government bonds were accused , judge of the Supreme Court in O@@ man under pressure , to stand up a verdi@@ ct in a possession of inheritance . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n from 26 July 2016 , with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; high @-@ level parties bind hands of justice . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i became a member of the Board of Edit@@ ors from the ISS before the special department and det@@ ention on his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS awarded the dep@@ uty @-@ chief editor of You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had worked on Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest as a chief editor . &quot;
&quot; the paper was closed on a certain time after the information given the statement , that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 forbidden . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , before the court in Mas@@ kat was the first hearing in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i . &quot;
the court condemned the three journalists to prison sanctions and also ord@@ ingly the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j , both among others were condemned to the dis@@ ruption of the public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the &quot; &quot; State of the State &quot; . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of violation of an audience ban and to be found guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of arrest and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one @-@ year profession took place against the two journalists . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a imprisonment of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 USD ) , after making use of &quot; a information network for the spread of material that could pose a danger to public order &quot; . &quot; &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i a deposit was established in the amount of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the judgment of judgment .
&quot; the Ap@@ pe@@ al Court spoke to Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , however , Al @-@ Ha@@ j entered a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i to six months of prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i was released on 10 April 2017 after the sentence of his sixth sentence in Mas@@ kat died on 10 April 2017 . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his sentence .
the Ap@@ pe@@ al Court also highlighted the decision of the Information Ministry of Economics to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper looks like attacks by the Roman@@ ic government . &quot;
on January 8 the information panel made a statement by which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Information sm@@ in@@ ister signed a further instruction where closing &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with the Ministers the Ministers presented another time against the decision of the appeal , the publication of the newspaper again . &quot;
&quot; the continual closure of Az@@ am@@ n , and the attacks on journalists of the paper are not the only ones in which in which the freedom of press was in@@ ju@@ red in recent times . &quot;
&quot; for example , further violations include the closing of the web site of the independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to adjust its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the det@@ ention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to prepare the comprehensive injury of the press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Golf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the European authorities on : &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and uncondi@@ tionally free ;
&quot; 2 . a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n to create , so that their journalists can be re@@ ast of their work ; &quot;
3. freedom of press in the country and to protect the freedom of the press
&quot; 4 . in all circumstances , to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in O@@ man can exercise their right@@ ful human rights work , and without fear of contrac@@ tions , including judicial authorities . &quot;

medical research in Africa : chances and mis@@ conc@@ eptions
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or 2016 in Zambia , illustration takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or is not mentioned in the media . this is an increasing area that addresses the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for sale on @-@ site medical research . there are two reasons : for one lack in the offer of global health care for many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria have far more serious effects than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases through the pharmaceutical firms are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; second , research , which is carried out by African scientists themselves , in building their own research capacity in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or is director of the Central warehouse building on the research of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic first engra@@ ving impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania for@@ ged himself on HIV virus , before it decided to go back home to support the sam@@ b@@ arian health system . &quot;
with Global Vo@@ ices Dr. Warri@@ or discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of the media using this research .
( disclaimer : Dr. Warri@@ or speaks as an individual ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or R@@ W : at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ ish national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory testing .
&quot; besides , I have just been a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogen@@ s . &quot;
G@@ V : what are your opinion about the important current research themes in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
R@@ W : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always stay the recipient instead of being creators . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often used in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
R@@ W : from the US and Europe .
the projects are very well supported .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here , because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : how is research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you haven &apos;t had before ?
&quot; R@@ W : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , continuous supply with electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
R@@ W : there are already interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
&quot; I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools , to improve the situation . &quot;
&quot; G@@ V : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus , and how can we support development ? &quot;
R@@ W : the potential is amazing .
I saw great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , beginning at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of the space , the health system ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ agi@@ ous diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
G@@ V : can you describe us the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; R@@ W : often it is the limited speed , things to do , and the low @-@ way access to scientific expertise that represent challenges . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines are available only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , limited the amount of available information and speed of research . &quot;
&quot; from the USA to India : such as &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; seed producers will change global food production
&quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com site , a magazine , which reports all the solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has been bred in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ge@@ ous , the first plant that is cultivated by NASA @-@ A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space @-@ space and consumed . &quot;
&quot; for nearly 20 years , Mor@@ tons work was only given by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question how many sal@@ es@@ sters can get limits . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noted that more and more sal@@ ads were patented , and that he could not continue using it further . &quot;
&quot; patents work not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or curved leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , more such patents have been log@@ ged in more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ ons @-@ sites . due to this trends , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts are concerned about the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; although passionate representatives of a mill@@ en@@ nia of an mill@@ en@@ nia , Mor@@ ton is still salad , he still needs to do more since his work is becoming more and more limitations . &quot;
&quot; it is , as would lie in a river a rock , around which I have her@@ d@@ elling . &quot;
&quot; so we must now do that , but it is a break with the breeding @-@ tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go to Sal@@ ads too far . &quot;
&quot; and when they stand in court , no one can breed any new sal@@ ts because all the characteristics are already patented , so as all the features are already patented and tried to breed those characteristics which he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he is also connected to a movement that is getting bigger in the U.S. and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; breeding ) .

&quot; it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather than it would come from the IT department , and not from the realm of plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative ( initiative for &quot; &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; &quot; open source &quot; software , &quot; the alternatives to copy@@ right@@ ed software . &quot;
it was called into life to ensure that some plant species and gene are not being protected as intellectual property and can be used for plant bree@@ ders permanently .
&quot; in the context of the initiative , which is called Os@@ si , the US bree@@ ders can also commit to use the seed that others can use them freely . &quot;
&quot; this means , however , does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and buy it . &quot; open source &quot; bree@@ ders only allow others to breed , to breed so own varieties , and not immediately rec@@ oll@@ ections - two aspects that have been banned by many plants . &quot;
do@@ zens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy views
&quot; for the professor of the University of Wisconsin and Os@@ si Member States , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are in control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; seed plays a role in larger assem@@ blies such as Bi@@ odiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try to use the latter not or just little , by eating seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
&quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasises that the &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; movement is not employed with gene@@ tically modified plants . &quot;
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , corn , gene@@ tically modified or not , arising from ecological agriculture or Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer continues to be announced in August or September 2016 . &quot; &quot; who is doing good , locally and sustainable produ@@ ci@@ zed vegetables , should also know that the way is bred on how this vegetables is bred . &quot;
dietary vin@@ ity with no seed @-@ sou@@ ver@@ ity is not possible .
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative to undertake other seeds , are still free to provide , with it , its actions in contrast to the seed and plant characteristics . &quot;

&quot; Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of the food supply is endangered since the available Gen@@ pool is due to getting numerous of the intellectual property rights based on plant material , which therefore is always limited , un@@ eff@@ usive . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of Os@@ si , has engaged in its doctor@@ ate with genetic variation in car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . it found out that about a third of all cart@@ els @-@ characteristics is protected as a intellectual property , making it used for plant bree@@ ders either not or is not usable . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there is still not such estimates , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ driven plants as wheat are patented in even larger style as salad or car@@ r@@ ots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants will be bred as they are targeted characteristics - of such , by which their tastes or colour improves until such , due to which they flour@@ ish in certain environments and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for bree@@ ders are due to ever more patents . genetic variety is now however unnecessary than ever before , since the changing conditions caused by climate change are much worse . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail mon@@ san@@ to @-@ speaker Car@@ ly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to , that genetic variety is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ tos activity . with a total of four genital banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the United States . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradi@@ cts that the intellectual property of other bree@@ ders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant @-@ related innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is essentially taken a plan that everybody can follow , once the patent is ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions can help others with another method to reach the same result .
&quot; such protection therefore does not inhi@@ bit innovations , but promotes it to be made available to the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton sees that differently : 20 years to wait , until a patent stands , and surely no innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you have so long to wait to grow plants , which have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , the struggle could have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a general , and it should remain as well : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ eti@@ aries are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want to make farmers their job easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it will make us impossible if we will not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; altogether , Mor@@ ton does not distur@@ b themselves to the concept itself , crop @-@ characteristics : &quot; we create the characteristics not really itself . &quot;
&quot; the plants form them themselves and as bree@@ ders , we finally have no idea how plants do that . &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ ders in the US @-@ state Oregon and Os@@ si Member States , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; who den@@ sed a variety , also bred his own values in them . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with great cour@@ ty@@ ards and mon@@ oc@@ ultur@@ ists , in whose cultivation are mass@@ aged her@@ bic@@ ide , who re@@ bred in its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
&quot; my concept is exactly fine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; while some moderate @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than e.g. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents have to survive , most smaller seed companies , even without patents work - either they reject the pat@@ rons or they stop it for too expensive and therefore not rewar@@ ding or both . &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ ders Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for in his farm@@ stead Sal@@ ads .

&quot; Mor@@ ton is also the view that bre@@ eder by the prevention of phy@@ pat@@ ors of innovative would : &quot; it looks like I do with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that are patent . &quot;
&quot; I need a constant new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors are selling my varieties within a few years . &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; with a patent one is 20 years ahead of competition , which makes it easy to do in my opinion very nicely . &quot;
&quot; although the USA seem to be leading in the &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; cat@@ tery , but the concept spreads rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture , &quot; which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , a &quot; &quot; open source &quot; plant seed . &quot; to preserve the seed plant traditional farm plant , it helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; plant seed and to sell their own .
&quot; the German organisation Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; license , which ultimately is a form@@ idable and legally binding form of Os@@ si obligation for bree@@ ders in the European Union . &quot;
( regulations for the breeding differ from country to country because the Os@@ si obligation cannot simply be accepted one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive Board of the European Union , the European Commission , explains that conventional plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European patent , which allows patents on a conventional plant . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed trade systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seeds and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn something about the &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; Program for &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed systems that the organization is currently launching a worldwide alliance for &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; seed systems , for the planned next year of the official start@@ up . &quot;
&quot; a merger of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international Non@@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on seeds , technology and con@@ centr@@ ation worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - an association and out of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - it represents that farmers can have the opportunity to all@@ evi@@ ate and improve seed politics , so that a stable supply of food is ensured . &quot;
&quot; in the report also stresses the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food insurance systems - a connection , by the Lu@@ by von Os@@ si , that will soon see him more people soon . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has focused mainly on where and how something is grown , and seed control systems have hardly played a role , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we now try to quart@@ z the human being , that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
even more still the Egyptian authorities content on the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
&quot; on the weekend around the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government documents the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on them . &quot;
&quot; August the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities continue to criti@@ ci@@ zed by the Egyptian authorities for this step and continue to continue the work and efforts to continue human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information continues despite this attack and the exp@@ ul@@ sion of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , which the law would actually defend its goal , so it was never as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirmed that all technical possibilities will be exhausted , so it was never as important as it is now . I insist on to fulfill our task further . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered to be the first zen@@ ed website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities signed up more than two months 21 websites , like e.g. the independent news of MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ speaking issue of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar , from Qatar @-@ based network of Al J@@ aze@@ era because of the alleged &quot; support of terrorism &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; besides AN@@ HR@@ I also exists on the blog of the Colom@@ bian and human rights @-@ based research scientist Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada , no access in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the distribution of colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles , which he does not write in Egypt with accessible websites and media . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , which he set up , in order to handle the cel@@ esti@@ al apparatus of the Egyptian government , even destination of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blog@@ ger , who is also home with Zi@@ adas blog , however , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity , after being arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces , while he participated in the student prot@@ esting and had a video , as the police exercise physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles are mainly about politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment Zi@@ ada vo@@ iced to the closure by the government and refl@@ ecting what this means for him :
&quot; the main blogs to sper@@ ren is very old , however , has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the closure of the blog may not be significant for the world , so it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It succeeded to convey to me the feeling of a Bel@@ ag@@ ation condition ; a suspic@@ ion of murder , ou@@ tre@@ ach of the national Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other website , for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I wrote not in otherwise . in other words , my words have an impact , even if only on a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to the post of items to handle the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; but now , after having locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mu@@ cks are walking the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ick@@ and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) of the Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this takes technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , e.g. Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE is also documented the blocking of vendors , through the circum@@ navigation of dormit@@ ory or@@ ship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( VP@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in its research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12th , we noticed how the block@@ age of websites to offer VP@@ N@@ s . &quot;
&quot; such practice points to the intention of the government to block content , and to filter on the Egyptian users . &quot;
&quot; the situation will additionally be wast@@ ed that the sl@@ ur@@ ges behind closed doors are made , whereby the Egyptian population does not have a legal basis , in which they can proceed against these actions . &quot;
&quot; now the question is : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and whom will it be the next attack ? &quot;
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?

&quot; day after day , newspapers with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard theme . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school , &quot; &quot; every second day a police officers in Rio de Janeiro were mur@@ dered , &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe rau@@ lt pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest standards for 10 years . &quot;
&quot; the Brazilian NGO Global Justice , even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene . &quot;
reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least find the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; for detailed reporting of violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16 August the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which they announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now being published .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ bery , sex waste , etc . everything , which is happening by the civili@@ zed standard and what is only in Rio in the heading &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call , this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we can not close our eyes in front of the cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the chief editor of the newspaper , that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war at all .
&quot; in the same video a journalist of the newspaper , that there are according to statements by the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 territories that are controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
in the editorial article the newspaper writes on :
&quot; of us is aware that a war exchange rate , if it is distor@@ ted , also it can be used , atro@@ cities of the police that sho@@ ots up and then ask questions to hide . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in police , whose objective is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the m@@ af@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; more than they benefit ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil argu@@ ed the journalist of Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , to call violence as &quot; war &quot; . &quot; this be in their opinion a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to hold responsibility in the police . &quot;
this is not war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as an extra when analysis of the Military Analysis in Rio itself has shown - combined with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ suff@@ iciency of public service . &quot;
to re@@ membran@@ ce : the federal state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

&quot; Rio de Janeiro , called &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , is according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia false : &quot; 22 of 30 non @-@ violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the latest data available . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the federal state Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ as per federal state , Rio at No.@@ 16 is in place 16 &quot; , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; extra is owned by the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company South America , such as Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia stressed , repe@@ ats the security policy of the state . &quot;
&quot; this security policy was also included in the creation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a massive police supply a Fav@@ ela and a unity permanently there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . for several years , the U@@ PP was supposed to protect against several reports of chic@@ ks and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor congreg@@ ations , which should actually protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under discussion . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux was declared from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio is not established by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; for this calls on the state to use the means and paths that are typical of a war . this includes the penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; with which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the countryside and becomes the object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; and &quot; ir@@ rig@@ ated balls &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war or her , fact is that the inhabitants of Fav@@ elas in Rio continue to suffer . &quot;
&quot; one week it is now that the police reached the mountain using the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , to demonstrate the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all these violence , this incident head@@ lines : a fruit res@@ eller died as a result of shots that had ch@@ ased the police from a helic@@ opter . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brut@@ ality and block@@ ages , mainly through Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; according to victory Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization P@@ ax and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ ei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is especially affected by the East Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition go out , based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the mass@@ acre of Assad regime was exercis@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , those of rebels have been controlled controlled areas outside Damascus under Bel@@ ag@@ ation , which led to local residents on local or through tunn@@ els and control points . &quot;
&quot; due to the years of block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and academ@@ ics also teaches the inhabitants of the East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can create their own fung@@ i as &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and perform the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to the conventional , built @-@ in food and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , it makes them an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besi@@ eged East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Direct of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided for cultivation of fung@@ i because they have high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for this project for three years , and op@@ pressing its relief that it becomes more and more &quot; to famili@@ arity . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative we use in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge of the pl@@ anting of fung@@ i , so Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12.@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect gifts to Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is dependent on generators , which hold the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and the humidity at 80 % . &quot;
&quot; because of fuel tax , locally produced fuel from plastic products are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with the &quot; production of from the regions &quot; &quot; fung@@ al &quot; , &quot; before they conc@@ eive their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , they planted a small mush@@ room in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a bigger tub . and so on . &quot;
&quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; cur@@ riculum for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after further 3 months they have visited mushrooms from East Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mush@@ room breeding from various reasons &quot; : split of si@@ ege . &quot;
providing a new food source in the market .
&quot; distribution of a culture of self @-@ suff@@ iciency by the rem@@ n@@ ants ( such as paper , tea , coffee kit , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women , the home work . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are tied to their home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the si@@ ege is visible . &quot;
we want our experience inspired people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of fires of 2017
&quot; several hundred people prot@@ ested during the 21st of October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires , which in the week before that in the north of Portugal . &quot;
two forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were in@@ ju@@ red by the forest fires of the 15th and 16th of October . this led to the fact that the government called last week from solidarity with the victims for three days .
fires were also registered in the Gali@@ zi@@ en region where there were 4 lo@@ aves .
&quot; it appreci@@ ates that there were more than 500 fire@@ qu@@ arri@@ es , which spreads across the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million acres of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , in Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande a similar tragedy , where there was 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest @-@ areas per satellite shots , only 2017 in Portugal approximately 50@@ 0.000 hectares of forest burned - an area of the size of the district Lisbon . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the Ernst of the situation : there are only in 4 districts .
&quot; Portugal is burning in the true sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a , ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) 15 October , 2017 &quot;
some of Twitter @-@ users shared pictures :

numerous videos spread on the web and show pictures that allow better insights into the events :
the Ab@@ y@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ ven@@ - and fire fighting measures through the state .
&quot; the people asked themselves , why civil protection was not able to re@@ com@@ fy the extent of the tragedy as far as possible . &quot;
JoÃ£o So@@ ver@@ al from the federal government of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
according to Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o were streets and villages for anything and nothing .
&quot; this Sunday she did not do this anywhere , there are stupid reports of open roads that were enclosed by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen once again as in June , since the streets were locked very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , construction permits in est@@ ables with a high fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a wide @-@ reaching proposal for the whale @-@ shape , which the government had brought to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was fought by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which was the case if the applicant were determined by means to self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that all could be built , JoÃ£o Sor@@ val in the same article by the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Quer@@ cus made aware that large areas with Eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees from slightly burning wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , as in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this type . &quot;
&quot; these problems occur that the website of civil protection from Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as resident would seek information or were trying to contact relatives , offline . &quot;
&quot; it was a private initiative that cat@@ ered the population with information : they used the own civil protection data using the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt , and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires . &quot;
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer of JoÃ£o P@@ ina in order to simplify work of fire bri@@ g@@ ade , and on this fat@@ eful weekend in October , that the servers of the 400,000 people were persec@@ uted , not at any location : there was more than half a million train . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

in one night in autumn 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
&quot; two years ago had been a terrible civil war between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings , who defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan was a country of terror and desp@@ air . &quot;
&quot; exactly at this time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central @-@ gh@@ an@@ istan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother did not say it so , she knew she would no longer see her son for a long time - maybe even more . &quot;
in the morning the boy should break up .
his un@@ cle would pick it up and bring him to the lo@@ ep@@ herds .

CC @-@ 2.0
Abdu@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari ; the leader of Hez@@ ara domin@@ ate the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ soldier had just been mur@@ dered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt like protecting itself .
the Taliban on their hat@@ red to the Haz@@ ara known Taliban ever came closer .
many Haz@@ ara abandoned the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coher@@ ent . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left from his low wages , and went in Iran . once again , he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and tow , with mort@@ ar , the he@@ avier than he himself , in order to make himself a living . &quot;
&quot; at that time as today , life af@@ gh@@ s was influenced by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , I remembered A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ ans refugees ) lived in a quiet building on the construction site , on which we also worked . &quot;
there was no services there and no heating . we handed n@@ ylon in front of the open windows that we do not rede@@ em at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ ks allowed his life without papers in Iran behind him and made it ready for travel to Europe . &quot;
&quot; with the dangerous crossing over the sea , he suffered a ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ and@@ ete on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ shar@@ af homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church who distributed twice the day eating in need of aid . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is quite a second chance for ex@@ changing asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is also true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers are cat@@ astrop@@ hic in the country . &quot;
&quot; the Human Rights Organization of Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system is suffering from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special performances &quot; centers . these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to an recep@@ tive centre , if they officially launched a request for asylum , which can still lead to the registration of asylum . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for an accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it is also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ sh@@ ame@@ ful lifestyle helped A@@ shar@@ af to soon liber@@ ate themselves out of these conditions .
&quot; after spending several years of working in the building , A@@ shar@@ ks fell into the creation of a youth hostels in Venice . &quot;
&quot; this ran so well , that he opened a second hostel after a while and opened a sn@@ ug@@ lim@@ bic . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is the theme of the documentation &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian Harbour - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director , A@@ min W@@ ah@@ id@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the film won the Venice City Award , which was already awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
lots of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to in@@ official estimates about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
for many of them the country is a transi@@ tional solution on the way to other European countries .
&quot; recent years have emerged some of Afghanistan companies , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some af@@ gh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent food .
&quot; in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience , in which the wa@@ iters and the kitchens are largely refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant talks about the various af@@ gh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Ent@@ repr@@ en@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also available in Afghanistan .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims range far beyond the Italian catering and retailers and aim to go back to the country that he had to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , are also possibilities &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; I never forget my country and I cannot live happily , if I know that my people suffer . &quot;
&quot; I am planning a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as anyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af lubric@@ ator also for@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where men can read packaging and preser@@ v@@ atives techniques . &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvest on the market and improve their financial situation &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful ent@@ repr@@ en@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there are stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

&quot; the Egyptian Parliament checks a draft law , which regards that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration at a government agency . &quot;
&quot; users would have to take advantage of the social networks , within six months after the successful leg@@ tes@@ ters on the website of the authority under specification of their full name , as well as their information number . &quot;
those who failed to fail this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the withdrawal of a penalty .
&quot; the law , which was advertis@@ ed by sixty members , the legislative and the constitutional committee of the Parliament is present and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; May be a member of the member of the Parliament , of the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the asser@@ tion of the president or by the high officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law the insul@@ ting of the president as well as state institutions is already pun@@ is@@ hable . under the law of law a such act would be sum@@ mon@@ ed with pr@@ isons and fin@@ es , as legal experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be adopted , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 as an Egyptian police officers , who demonstrated violence against prot@@ esters , who fought against the military coup d during the elected President Moh@@ ammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited for as more than 700 participants , who were arrested in the same incident , four years in jail on a Jur@@ is@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; recently he was postpon@@ ed his trial on 20 May because the pr@@ isons , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the def@@ endant of prison into the court room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens death penalty on account of one , so many human rights groups agree , hypo@@ cris@@ y of such weapon @-@ collection , illegal assembly , murder and mal@@ ign@@ ant murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court spoke free in G@@ iza , the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were charged for their coverage on pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdu@@ ll@@ ah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested earlier in advance , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunisi@@ an activ@@ ist for sc@@ anned documents
&quot; in May Tunisi@@ an authorities six hours with the trial of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has mainly been cro@@ wned by the President of the Republic , which is governed by the President of the Republic , according to the Plan expressly warran@@ ted a controversial officer , the busin@@ ess@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption accused Am@@ nest@@ y , provided that all these un@@ law@@ ful funds will be returned . &quot;
&quot; the document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , casts a light on how the pre@@ di@@ als plans to support the legislation . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the ren@@ aming of its sources , under the indication of Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press , which journalists have the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he entered the District Court in Tunis on 09 . May as a witness in the case . &quot;
does China want to force the users to social media to submit their identification ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the Council of the Council of the People &apos;s Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users need social media in China to write or share messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the registration is stated that the registration is required with the full potential name . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st susp@@ ect that due to the elimination of anonymous comments in sub @-@ hal@@ ves within social networks , it is still unclear how the authorities apply these rules . &quot;
&quot; Chinese companies have proposed social media in social media , these regulations are only sel@@ ectively vali@@ dated to protect the civil journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot;

&quot; this name is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian Government sets up a list of online services that will organise the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to hold services responsible for removal of content and to force them on request for the suspension of user data . &quot;
