<seg id="1">"although I visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love of America is extremely great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I have grown up with American films, made American authors read and run his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly journalist because of an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Stuate the murderous conspiracy of a oil-magnates, who were sustened his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," me, as if the absolute truth is, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year that I lived in Arizona, had only strengthened my admiration for the USA only."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I said:" America is the only country in which I have lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the way you are, and it's easy acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very warmer love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written on the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his bottling.</seg>
<seg id="15">"he never stops behind the mountain, as it says so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks, like a former colleague put it, and openly declared his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted in Scharen for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million voices that he won in the Republican presidential elections, was the highest number, which was ever raised by the party nominee."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigotte person and asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters don't have met with the people I met in Phoenix for my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalist program, people from all over the world raise, a deep sticking person with which I could talk about Islam and its past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Trumps World gives not coincide with the Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball, and we spent many hours with it to watch the" Phoenix Suns "in the game."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps Intolerance stands also in contrast to generosity that I lived in Sandy Bahr, who fought for her life for the environment and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me as their son."</seg>
<seg id="26">It fits them with the engagement of Kristi Kappes which always helped with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">"then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice has helped me a lot to my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those with them embodied values deepened my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while the Trump's path to the nominee Republican presidential data, they offered me a grip and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">However it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either shared racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump-voters as a rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange people, said one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficial and disrespectful, and indicates a incapacity to understand those who act in a different way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their churches will not be considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters have been tuned for Trump, because they want to re-win control of a country that has disappointed me?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they may perhaps say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who sees the cruel decision to raise a man who look down with contempt on those who look different."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" "Whitelash" "(m. B. SC.: as much as" runs of white against all other ethnicities, "play as much as shiny on the whites and whiplash as it was the great Van Jones, exactly the killed what America has made so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate American ideal - regardless of whether the myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you like, America is definitely welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyrian, whose story, as he says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"however, with the election Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back on Ruder, say they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a lautstrong" "no!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" brood the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latin America a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" "replied."</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they called them and their voices were louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and powerful "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan closed with the words:" "God was thanks, Mr. Trump, is that not your America." "36 hours later it was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the country, for which his son was, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Land, the message said."</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America.</seg>

<seg id="98">"this article, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, published a magazine that targeted on international, practical solutions for environmental issues."</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication happens as part of an agreement with Global Voices on shared usage of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa it was then known that this ship was already operated in liberated waters illegal fishing, before it sought the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were brought about accordingly and little constricted to welcome an legislative brecher of this type on its shores.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the comers, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised themselves swiftly against the ship. they lingered to him, one of their harbours, and refuse to give him a fishing permits."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" Ursuddenly was the prime minister surrounded by countries that simply refuse anything, "" Benedict Kiilu, an introductory employee of the Kenyan Fisheries. he is part of a team that discovered the ship over time and followed. "</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch up there fish."</seg>
<seg id="105">"finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to pillage of the fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, criminal practices crossed and resources was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries, which at that time the prime minister had driven out of their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" with this we have eight countries, which are like-minded and working together. they exchange information and stand up each other where it is about illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is captured is hidden that it is extremely difficult to absorb. thus the illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">"by intentional contempt of existing laws, by which certain habitats and types are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm to have a delicate equilibrium."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were once handicapped by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail, with the information between individual countries, the actions occur today in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"here the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspected activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i pursues the activities of vessels also very attentive, if they move on the open sea with satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this makes it possible to mark the authorities, ships that fish in the bottomed areas. also, so suspicious driving tests will discover that a ship was given his fish out on other ships on the way."</seg>
<seg id="115">"in the ideal case, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license, where they have been on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal record."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing, can then refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports. what does the ships could not sell their charge. and that they can even be forced to the numbers of penalties, as in the case of the Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" then it is a considerable financial loss for the owner, meaning that the illegal fishing fishing is no longer worthwhile. "</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, General Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and thereby also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the platform mentioned above was created to re-estimated 20 million USD in lost sales, which lose eight members of the network HISH-i every year due to the illegal fishermen that penetrate into East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna-fish-fish because of the region's commercial fishing from around the world. among these also these illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include such practices, such as the sailing under falsely flag, fake license deposits, indication of fantasies, the fishing protected species and the fish in nature conservation areas."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a not fully organized control system, "says Long." "sooner, a ship could be illegal fishing and a country could then say" You darst not running my harbour. "</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'comm to me'. 'and exactly this legal slugs is tempted to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspects ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has uncovered criminal networks, which had been distributed by counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that pursues several fraudulent identities and it has escaped ships."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing and vast distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our studies lead us rather far into the organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">"it builds a system that is intended to help FISH-i, comparative ships concise."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly further developed, also helps to hide illegal ships who are happy to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position, "says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships turn up for example its automatic identifier systems, with which they cannot become more of satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland helps to build a system that connects different information levels, it should help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team African nations actually influence this undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened together with Google and the Marine Sea Organization Oceana. the platform Global Fishing Watch opens: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed around the world by means of each individual traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" join forces with the neighbors to get a better picture of what is doing - that's just meaning "," he says. "" here is a chance for countries to combine and combine their resources for the examination. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run, where a global system the persecution of vessels permits."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only sense criminals, but also scams."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships used earlier without a license and hardly had to reckon with consequences, they now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating at FISH-i participating countries have now to buy a 33% increase of fisheries revenue, since then fishing boats more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia, Greko 1 helped him, Greko 1 found the inspecs there on board tow, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries are noticing these successes." "the effect is so strong that now also other countries", "says Kiilu." "we are a study objective." "in West Africa each year disappear several hundred million dollars by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015 six countries have joined together six countries, for so-called West Africa Task Force. now they are fighting the illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "With security is the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest affiliate in Somalia could report its first big triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship that was on the wrong flag. and not only the ship was used without a license and were used slugge which is now prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated into ban waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the take of measures against Greko 1 put them a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative way of protecting the oceans actually works throughout the world sea.

<seg id="786">"for me, this is as if they were tempting those who have lost someone, and those who are afraid that they also happen in such a thing."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories about mere numbers are taken in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The insomnia of the people is incredible for me if the death of six people and the disappearances of 43 students in a neighbor had been justified that they were uninterrupted.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now in spite of a language barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1137">"for Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Initiative Treasure Storytelling (TLS), the creator of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"global Voices reported recently for a different initiative of Steven Bird, the unbridgeable blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"however here the focus of TLS is not written on the written report, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS already has conducted events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages do not be passed on to the children born children."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we do not have cities to embrace the diversity - safe spaces, in which residents do not have to forget who they are."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while listening is often linked with it, these events are instead called" the listening to appreciate, to feel. "</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers will tell her story first in her own language and translate them in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and their presentation make that listening to it."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video shows for example a traditional history from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou is also the opportunity to explain to their land typical customs of tale."</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the Fabel of the rabbits and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after he explains the meaning of his Fabel, John Nyamusara will be asked:" how is it to speak to an audience that does not share your language? "with a wide crest, he shares his sense of inclusiveness:"</seg>

<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they enthused the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although over the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East-Indian origins, or generally used as an adjective."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or" "Beverage" "(in burial scriptures) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of the dislanguage in Burma during the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radicalal nationalist movements has given the word an extremely valuable comonnation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight in Myanmar, the company has a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar's usually associated with racism now, but the word itself is not automatically signalling."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also Posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed by his use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"furthermore, there are several burial words with fundamental meanings that have the same letters as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written to Burmesisch also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as' Kalar Pae '(Cambodia),' Kalar oat '(Kamel) or' kalarcaar '(curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facilities Appung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends has been deleted now because he enthused the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends on a rich way whether he knew his back pain, as he did his back pain."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the sentence ku la -" "healing" "(ku) + the Frageword (la) on Burmesan - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win is the opinion that they will reduce high-language radicalal nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook analytic might be analytical, before it all Posts lodges that spread in the suspicion of racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automation is not understood what you read on facet.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do, the post office is carefully to analyze and control it by checking the next words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example" "Kalar Htine" "(chair) and" Kalar Pae "(alternate)."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these three-legged nationalists are spreading, a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcate its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to everyone, disseminating the disagreement, the efficiency of this strategy may not be long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and Wechat have proven that the censorship of percussions are often a kittens and mouse game, whereby the user will start social networks just to use a new word or alternative spelling of the zened word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his postings, when he only wanted to inform his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned by the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was attentive to this new Directive on Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>

<seg id="1317">"Facebook has a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions, or who simply try to show their opinions against the Hassspeak radicalal nationalists."</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with speech:"</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post the author divided his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmesan Internet Community to ask for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook likes to have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">To censor such words becomes even more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have said these words as" "chair" or "hersencurry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even as they found that they have made mistakes, they attempted not to correct the falsely resolved posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits, which give them a great turnover, would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has taken care of much spott among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users are now using Facebook funny and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hasslanguage to see if their posts are taken from the net."</seg>

<seg id="1472">"instead, they use a pronouns or say" "father of my child." ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect that they should respect the husband due to social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should abused the norm."</seg>

<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs that there are in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is run by the community of Video Volunteers and supports the dismantling of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pawas has been working with the help of her video camera at the uncovering of practices, such as children's heirat up to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-Ininfected, and guides these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">It tells about how these clubs created a safe place for these women and they have made them at the same time to ambassing the change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini was shown in their discussion, was of women who call their spouses in their name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject because she wanted to open the interview about Patriarchate with a problem that women can easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the name of their spouses not to speak out loud, is a bread that they must maintain all charges and never be questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini is:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not hold this, is considered to be" spiritually "as woman without morals."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini did not want to have called her husband to have never called on behalf at home, at home as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">It showed the video of the discussion round of her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband are still far too long after the video was finished.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I have to name him from now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage Rohini started its first discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the turn, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video project, the women tried to bring the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different emotions - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked them all," "If we cannot tell the name of our spouses, but they can call us how they want, does that they do not respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be inconsistent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her spouses on the lips," "Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the break of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women the names of their spouses."</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she was only kissed during the whole exercise; another chose to release the whole frustration of frustration against him and his family by hiding him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in the adrenalin rush on, with an ancient fires, the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their spouses in their name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they stopped their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put into the head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner outside the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she was blinded, she got afraid and said that there was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini said, I have to do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation artened in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reported how women have tried to stop other practices, such as the wearing of the zinnoberred dots on the forehead, which indicates the spine:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would carry the zinnoberred dot if he also worked."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughs only and I heard that to wear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely heard with it, but my; they are now in a better position to choose to wear it in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we are doing a trip in every discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want to make the women worry who what could hear," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"for the first time in their life they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sangen, and spoke about things that they had never thought of before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years, and yet I have had about some things, for example how our identities are knotted to our spouses, have never been so honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say certain things out loud, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion, we are talking about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most is it's okay, but some wanted a Salwas Kurta to carry a broad shirt over a pants; they did not have a drunk."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of your own clothes, morals are connected with the Saris and much more, adorned Rohini her own pair of currants (upper shirts) into a discussion, so that the women could carry them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next they have decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear Jeans and Rohini is for sure they will create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question, whether in the five months have already been changed since their first panel, Rohini confirmed that things slowly come into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then listened to the name of their spouses."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including myself, make it still, but only if they are alone and no other family members are included."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to say the name of her spouse; only one or two women carry now at any time Zinnoberrot at their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"the women in the discussion, know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as the feasted around more freedom of movement, or the own clothes-selection - at the end of a difficult to navigate."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club each of us gives us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not just limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when each woman is coming home and other people about what we talk about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may be stupid as Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Federal Minister K. Shanmugam, Singapore was considered to be a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This observation has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Anwaltskammer Association of the State New York, the Minister expressed that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He assassed that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody has questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," the logic to rotate "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, according to all our efforts and sacrifices, to create this valuable country, you can say that we are not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the semblance of escape from responsibilities to a mandatory injury."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, to eat country, is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons proposed by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended one idea, according to which one cannot measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', given that it seemed inevitably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York should be compared to the same cities that are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once you reach the core point of the theme, the good old corpushes of the authoritarian rulers appear to be Democrats, leaving the pivotal logic, as they fit better for their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the final week, the responses of Shanmugam were given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our Judicatives, our political system really non-responses."</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions answered with non-responses rationales.</seg>
<seg id="1704">"Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam, to illustrate his opinion, since they did not understand this conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city is, thus to which country belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I understand nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our weeksK Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point unless he was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by continuing his comment on the blog, he has to read about the reviews that one should begin to read the entire co-ordinates of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore was a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the conscription.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"as he said that Singapore was rather a" city "than a country," he explained why the elections in Singapore was so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He lived in Singapore with cities in the U.S. (and how many of these cities saw a party in decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said, Singapore," was not a country, "he obviously does not believe it in this sense!"</seg>

<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes that he really is, and aware of what he defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review submitted the weakness of Shanmugams reasoning:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmugam "good a mistake" or was it a freudder speaker?</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only regarded as independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, to which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as he plays an important role within the office, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam is of severe importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why are the Lonurer for their military service, but they only defend their city but do not defend its country?"</seg>

<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants to cross Europe or Latin America, some places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Wallachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexicress to a small woman with a corall-pink glasses and gilded earrings rings in Teddybarian form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">"it is known as Concepción González Ramírez and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">"this nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a target for Africans and Haitian, who are on the journey."</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel does not have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with ground-round walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants are coming here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Ms. Ramírez tells people in full minibuses and the upper part of the coast they start to call:" Mama Africa "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mum Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms and some have already slept outside on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">It would not like to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and bring them to hospital when they are sick, they buy them medicines that they cannot pay, they massaged them with a balsam, which stirred by the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived at a short time ago."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if mom's Africa was a reasonable-name for Mrs Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes, I reply with a smile." I really feel that it suits her, because African women are very nice women. "</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"you have lived in Brazil for some Africans who are on their way to the United States, to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had been hearing from other companions of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the circuit, "says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"he tells that Haitian's and Africans often travel the way together, and that Africans already speak on Whatsapp by Mrs. Ramírez."</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet has lived in Brazil before in Brazil and worked as a construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup Championship."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Bustift after Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave them again," "he smiling." "we will always stay in contact."</seg>
<seg id="1932">"Ms. Ramírez told that their guests will often send their text message when they continued to grading them, or to report her about the course of their journey."</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith in the drive of their work is.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she does not know much about Africa, but their guests have brought their croissants as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known, but she is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Wallachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"in this winter, Valencia and his family have received migrants in their little house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">It is a policeman and has found that the Bustickets are sold to many African migrants to be too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he began to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night offered."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitian."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on blankets on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a kitchenette."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," "says he." "I have experienced what they experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I have crossed the border across the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"there are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after he lived for three years, he was transferred from the United States after a raid on his work place."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants travels through Wallula, comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he was flying in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to squeeze money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in tapachula he asked for an accommodation and a well-known, a single-moving one, has offered him its roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later the family lives still there, and they tried to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses the passengers consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests to a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Ms. Ramírez seems happy that their house is full, but it is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone."</seg>
<seg id="1955">As a proud grandmother leaved them in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair-true that you made a customer, some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more, boy and Old."</seg>

<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided he had met his duty for this night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">It has to have been like midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">"I decided to sleep again, let's say, let's say that was my only option."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"some hours went, which came to me like minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call for the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the light fills the room" .Raus with you, Arschficker. "</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answered with the voice of a drunk young:" "my Lord, my Father must be fearful worries."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and beaway you, you will be victorious."</seg>
<seg id="2087">This was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they had always been released.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the jordanic Rapper Emsallam Hdaib, on the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends the bulk of his time inside, sometimes he smears to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, back and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"but to what one can leave, is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine lips."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the top of his family house, which had belonged to them since 1967; the year, in which Israel was completed his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family had forced to escape from their village in Palestine, in which she lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"now Hdaib is an impassioned activist who confronts the conservative majority and expressed their old opinions about gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapids."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, but also calls for the core of the whole Arab world. all these topics are not only in its hometown of Amman relevance, but also in cities that suffice from Damascus to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is restricted in his mind by borders, and he can feel loud with people who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not open it openly, he had a special descend against the American foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war-areas, something that he was born with his identity as" Palestinian-whispered of the second generation, "even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own life circumstances," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I'm a man, while he was soldered in waters of the nettles. it is the holy month Ramadan; in that time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise to sundown. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">The current law also stresses that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a senselfish hot jitag has little with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the pressures of a warm coffee and the swans of the Kent cigarette on the nose is primarily of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when looking at a glance into the neighboring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore avoids just avoids just to do fundamental things - as in the public during Ramadan Water, to not land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the interior of Jordanonia has announced a appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time already."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some MPs, which support the Islamic Chronicle by the Islamic branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argues that the sexual orientation of the homosexual fronts of Hamed sensual, the cultural and traditional norms of the country contradicts and the main reason for the concert."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the MP and former press conference in the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert" "had been cancelled" "due to the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many believe that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world was more dangerous activism, which represents the old proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila presents the jordanic people as a" progressive supporter of human rights "," which continued to stand for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement probably should not be simply wiped rhetoric, but actually a clear-clear reality in Jordan, which clearly expresses in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib traditional genital ormen to corpse by having placed his vision of the fate arabic women to have pre-marriage sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of a clearly lower-known woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"over the past few years, Jordan has increased the number of 'Honorary morde', the inofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch the number of honorary morde in 2016 has reached its peak; however, the institutional infrastructure is still missing to support women who tried victims and domestic violence to be appropriate."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on fighting control from 1954 women, women are exposed to inviolated violence, and for its release is often a years of bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee of the family that the woman has nothing to happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"even Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well-known, not to shy back in his country long as tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib openly argue that his work is political, however, that he is his music that is full of explicit assumptions to sexuality, freedom and expression, not separate policies."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, Mann."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I was arrested, politics," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" "Lawla al 3aib" "and in" "Ghareeb" "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs that are politically politically, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is often repeated:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, on which one can get in his words, what you want" - be it faith or non-faith, petero- or homosexuality. "</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan were talking about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + -individuals were still firmly ensored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014 Hdaib led an interview for the popular Jordanic OnlineProgramme Roya, to later realize that his comments were cramped from the context, and in his opinion were censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib acquires Hdaib open for the arabic TQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals did not unfold in the Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who has remained in memory today thanks to its homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks: when Abu Nuwhat was to work later on behalf of the potassists, in the eighth century could be open to homosexuality, why can Jordanier not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila, or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Hashemitic Kingdom, it is nothing new that government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are being silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the jordanic message service took place several former government officials and members of the teacher-association with the rationale they would have expressed critical about the problems in social media with deep-rooting corruption that are deeply rooted in the land."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the concert Hdaibs believes that only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanier."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is a constant giving and take. Jordanian has devastated a show, but the path of progress - there is Hdaib - consists of slow, bedding and inner changes. it is certain that these changes take place from day to day at the heart of the jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"finally, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, even, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreams not only dreams of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will deal with music, art and literature a genuine and basic openness - and not by bombs, streumunitions and in artificial nature. at least, he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it is, Hdaib will continue, and therefore also resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting to which Aman is heard as Student Fellow.</seg>

<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta Festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"you suspect that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohoists. another theory means that the strongholds, the drums and the tances were over more than one thousand years, in the armies from the west of Japan in the northeast marched, to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi, into the knee."</seg>

<seg id="2157">I looked at the Meguro Gajoen once again for a long time: two cars are just to be seen.</seg>

<seg id="2185">"this question was just about the two young Colombian activists from the foundation of BogotArt and Cristian Palacios by the Young Youth Youth Foundation, not out of the head and inspired it to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (letters for reconciliation), the young people exiles to write Guerilliterbo letters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"recently in short, her land of a historic event, and they wanted to contribute their part to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerridescent FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces), which forms the closing of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>

<seg id="2188">"however, in front of the Colombian, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters that have lived for many years have been exposed in illegal warehouses, and round the clock with their weapons, must now be integrated into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, in turn, who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases to get deep hatred against guerrilla warfare that now needs to be in its ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columbians would have to close together and help in integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that is exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love message to former Guerilller to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for each former casting fighters - which will then be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters of reconciliation was born on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Laureates, who took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there was Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to speak briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>

<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities Colombian such as Cali, Manicales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I have never thought that someone would be granted</seg>

<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not have precepts, but letters full of undergrowth of people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that is in between "," told the policy-President Manuela Jiménez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a employee of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca, giving you this unforgettable experience as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had handed over the letters, a former fighter took me through the camp of the Guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" "Cambuches" "(a sort of hut that live in the guerriler), I saw a guerriler that wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, because beside him on the bed was a MGL-Granatcher, a deadly weapon in the thorns."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I said to him anyway, and asked:" "hello, what do they do?" "he answered," I answered a letter that someone has written me. "</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>

<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life as war. to join the FARC, was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before hunger." I have never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes. "</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society out there, with open arms waiting for us."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have only learned how to handle weapons with weapons."</seg>

<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all men - including those who have killed and so much damage to us, and give us a smile and a hug."</seg>

<seg id="2295">After the third time it happened was clear to me that there was something lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rightful friends check-up the numbering signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you flown?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons I do not want to award their names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then happened something nonsense."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without having to register without my credit, without everything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"I broke my old SIM card, and cast them into the garbage."</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came to and checks in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"in the moment when I want to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you do not believe in security, just because you have left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">"our people already know, in which hotel you do not. you even know your room number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">"only to prove it, it is the number 115."</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still get in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about the gender equality, however, this is a tabby theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional kaukasy elements I still wear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, this seental barrier can I do not overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chatting with camera, I actually give me effort to see how the person watch out of her past - thus to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what are your friends, those who are dorsal?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I needed current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">"I talked with someone, the one and a half-month in Argun."</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait and he did not lock a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"I mean, they probably load the relatives, they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require a proof that the so-called" honour "has experienced through blood pleasures."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now even more pregnant men in this secrecy?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says it would not be very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then especially those who have no rich relative or were dropped off by their relatives, to put himself Kadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they will be held there, so that you can present them later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be killed, one will show their bodies on TV and claim them, they could have attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people are not just gone, they are targeted, to radicalalize."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is it just a mutation or have you a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just have someone who was arrested one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new of them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply put them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was himself as these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"however, until now they were not presented as bandits, so far there were no reports. we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would one not have these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation," already in the past? "</seg>

<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to lead us to" "civilisation", "but finally he was thrown back into the Stoneage."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were exhausted; I had colored eyelashes that contributed to Tubejeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security of the sharia has never bent me only one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian theater in Grosny, there was a place where every night, especially at weekends, a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew; they knew why men, young people who met."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a free speech: Kharda ma Kharda. that is said: "Spotte not about the unhappiness of another."</seg>

<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister, he began to speak on TV about morals."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he spoke not about us, but priority about the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could sense how the people in the city began to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who had punished and punished, consider it at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel like the situation in the Republic is steadily wasted."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activities are you going to go now?</seg>

<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for sale on-site medical research. there are two reasons: for one lack in the offer of global health care for many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research on these diseases through the pharmaceutical firms are a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"second, research, which is carried out by African scientists themselves, in building their own research capacity in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>

<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrior RW: at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results. I support the sambish national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory testing.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"besides, I have just been a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what are your opinion about the important current research themes in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this must change, otherwise we will always stay the recipient instead of being creators."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often used in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>

<seg id="2610">The projects are very well supported.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here, because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries."</seg>

<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer sciences, big data, research of the space, the health system (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe us the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: often it is the limited speed, things to do, and the low-way access to scientific expertise that represent challenges."</seg>

<seg id="2627">"from the USA to India: such as" "open source" "seed producers will change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com site, a magazine, which reports all the solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous, the first plant that is cultivated by NASA-Astronauts in space-space and consumed."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for nearly 20 years, Mortons work was only given by its own ingenuity and the question how many salessters can get limits."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noted that more and more salads were patented, and that he could not continue using it further."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents work not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or curved leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"in recent years, more such patents have been logged in more and more plants such as grain or cartons-sites. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts are concerned about the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"although passionate representatives of a millennia of an millennia, Morton is still salad, he still needs to do more since his work is becoming more and more limitations."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, as would lie in a river a rock, around which I have herdelling."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we must now do that, but it is a break with the breeding-tradition," he says. "I think that these patents go to Salads too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and when they stand in court, no one can breed any new salts because all the characteristics are already patented, so as all the features are already patented and tried to breed those characteristics which he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He is also connected to a movement that is getting bigger in the U.S. and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("open source" breeding).</seg>

<seg id="2643">"it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather than it would come from the IT department, and not from the realm of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed initiative (initiative for" "Open-Source" "seed) can be inspired by the movement for free" "open source" software, "the alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was called into life to ensure that some plant species and gene are not being protected as intellectual property and can be used for plant breeders permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2646">"in the context of the initiative, which is called Ossi, the US breeders can also commit to use the seed that others can use them freely."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"this means, however, does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and buy it." open source "breeders only allow others to breed, to breed so own varieties, and not immediately recollections - two aspects that have been banned by many plants."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy views</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the professor of the University of Wisconsin and Ossi Member States, Jack Kloppenburg are in control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"seed plays a role in larger assemblies such as Biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or just little, by eating seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">"Kloppenburg emphasises that the" "open-source" "movement is not employed with genetically modified plants."</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, arising from ecological agriculture or Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer continues to be announced in August or September 2016." "who is doing good, locally and sustainable producized vegetables, should also know that the way is bred on how this vegetables is bred."</seg>

<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of the food supply is endangered since the available Genpool is due to getting numerous of the intellectual property rights based on plant material, which therefore is always limited, uneffusive."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, Executive director of Ossi, has engaged in its doctorate with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it found out that about a third of all cartels-characteristics is protected as a intellectual property, making it used for plant breeders either not or is not usable."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there is still not such estimates, but experts such as Luby suggest that mass-driven plants as wheat are patented in even larger style as salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants will be bred as they are targeted characteristics - of such, by which their tastes or colour improves until such, due to which they flourish in certain environments and threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders are due to ever more patents. genetic variety is now however unnecessary than ever before, since the changing conditions caused by climate change are much worse."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail monsanto-speaker Carly Scaduto, that genetic variety is generally important and also decisive for Monsantos activity. with a total of four genital banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that the intellectual property of other breeders, as" patents and the protection of plant-related innovations. "" a patent is essentially taken a plan that everybody can follow, once the patent is expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions can help others with another method to reach the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection therefore does not inhibit innovations, but promotes it to be made available to the public more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees that differently: 20 years to wait, until a patent stands, and surely no innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have so long to wait to grow plants, which have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, the struggle could have already been lost."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general, and it should remain as well:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetiaries are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers their job easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it will make us impossible if we will not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"altogether, Morton does not disturb themselves to the concept itself, crop-characteristics:" we create the characteristics not really itself. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants form them themselves and as breeders, we finally have no idea how plants do that."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the US-state Oregon and Ossi Member States, there is another important aspect of the plant breeding:" who densed a variety, also bred his own values in them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with great courtyards and monoculturists, in whose cultivation are massaged herbicide, who rebred in its varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"my concept is exactly fine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some moderate-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than e.g. Monsanto are) patents have to survive, most smaller seed companies, even without patents work - either they reject the patrons or they stop it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both."</seg>

<seg id="2682">"I need a constant new material for my catalog, since I know that my competitors are selling my varieties within a few years." "he says." "with a patent one is 20 years ahead of competition, which makes it easy to do in my opinion very nicely."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the USA seem to be leading in the" "open source" "cattery, but the concept spreads rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, "which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, a" "open source" plant seed. "to preserve the seed plant traditional farm plant, it helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "open source" plant seed and to sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organisation Agrecol is working on an" "open source" "license, which ultimately is a formidable and legally binding form of Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for the breeding differ from country to country because the Ossi obligation cannot simply be accepted one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the Executive Board of the European Union, the European Commission, explains that conventional plants should not be patentable. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European patent, which allows patents on a conventional plant."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is to the governments of the Member States to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016 the Dutch organisation Hivos hosted a conference on" Open Source "seed trade systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seeds and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn something about the" "open source" "seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patenting seeds."</seg>

<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered to be the first zened website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities signed up more than two months 21 websites, like e.g. the independent news of MADA Masr, Arab-speaking issue of Huffington Post and Qatar, from Qatar-based network of Al Jazeera because of the alleged" support of terrorism "."

<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment Ziada voiced to the closure by the government and reflecting what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">"the main blogs to sperren is very old, however, has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the closure of the blog may not be significant for the world, so it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
