this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize .
&quot; long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he was striking that N@@ SA was illegal Telef@@ ones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence surgery , in which the CIA was literally blo@@ ws up for an atomic bom@@ b . &quot;
&quot; if the crazy sounds , read it . &quot;
it is an unbelievable story .
&quot; but do you know , if the chapters did not fall ? &quot;
the US government .
&quot; for nearly 10 years , the government has been established against R@@ isen , and called on it to call its inn@@ um@@ erable sources . &quot;
&quot; in this move , he became a symbol of the pattern of government , wh@@ ist@@ le @-@ blo@@ wers and journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Council , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media has not received this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones . &quot;
&quot; so as the government at R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ ageous re@@ por@@ ters did already before him , he refused , and said that he would prefer to go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , something exceptional . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they were ready for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ por@@ ter and sources can hide themselves less and less .
&quot; rather than fail and re@@ mises to the statements , you could do the digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so , the investig@@ ators , without his consent , his phone @-@ wise secre@@ tly is concerned , &quot;
&quot; just as his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , his credit date , and even travel @-@ wise with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Ster@@ ling , a CIA wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers and Ris@@ ens source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect himself from his head , wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers . but instead , the judiciary more condem@@ ns more than all the U.S. governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is a lot about their work as secre@@ tly . &quot;
since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers to a journalist .
&quot; so we set the press work to be protected by the first constitutional , because the government has more and more possibilities to sp@@ sp@@ out all . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology of the government allows to handle the rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they are able to contact them from the moment , rather than in retro@@ spect , in the witness . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software , which has not yet been written as R@@ isen , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ drop , an open source of source system for wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers , which was originally developed by us , named Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is today approved by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of mail an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents to upload or send information , just as with any ordinary contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government can no more information secre@@ tly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
&quot; Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole , to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world develop new sp@@ y technologies that end@@ anger us all . &quot;
&quot; it is to us to make sure that not only technology den@@ omin@@ ator like Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility , mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers . &quot;
&quot; the lack of ab@@ norm@@ alities in the supply of soldiers is modest and reported by crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm for the sig@@ h water of Fl@@ int proposes . or a Wall@@ street insi@@ der that war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&quot; &#91; on 3 . April 2016 , the largest data sheet of history was released . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; contained &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; , &quot; &#91; we have hidden Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness in tax hav@@ ens . &#93; This week we have published news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the law firm in Panama &apos;s law firm Fon@@ sec@@ a . &quot;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as mos@@ bags Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works , as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
&quot; also , there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad brief@@ ing firms in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia president Vladimir Putin guides , through a close friend of child coll@@ agen , a famous Cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people , and others who are waiting to wait for the next release , and to the next un@@ covered documents . &quot;
now it sounds like the plot of a agency gri@@ lled or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham .
&quot; it seems crying from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we think about what ?
&quot; but the truth is , if the rich and powerful ones are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not all of paying all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , this disclosure is phenomen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as the secret tax hav@@ ens are used by a few of them to hide and dev@@ our@@ ers -- something that we have been discussing and reveal for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seems very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work . &quot;
I always present it like a mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ cap@@ e .
&quot; so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind this prayer . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for pen@@ al and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters is . &quot;
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports of this matter in the USA .
&quot; presum@@ ably because there have been no famous Americans in these revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but by the principle that these tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a dat@@ l@@ eck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples to have the connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some US states you need less information to give less information to start a company than to obtain a libr@@ arian credit . &quot;
this kind of in@@ contin@@ ence in the US has allowed to sc@@ ales debt to school children .
it has sc@@ ams any more sus@@ cep@@ tible investors to cut off .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
&quot; so , we sent an covered investigation into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan . &quot;
&quot; our investig@@ ators gave himself a afri@@ can minister , bringing the money into the United States to buy a house , a Yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; so we really sho@@ cked it really that all of them have made suggestions for our investig@@ ators , how he could be transferred to his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all pre @-@ pre@@ aching . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course no money has been handed over to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has been subjected to our co@@ vert proposals .
it is not about a single leader in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; it is about how the system works , which is established by the corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound all very sor@@ bers , as if we could not do anything against it ; as if nothing ever had ever changed , as if it is always the rich and powerful ones . &quot;
&quot; but as a born Optim@@ ist , I really see that a lot has begun to change . &quot;
over the past few years we have seen pre @-@ violations for more transparency in which the owners of companies are concerned .
the topic took political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU has been recorded in the central regi@@ sters at the national level , who really is behind firms in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging here .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliament , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how this Panama disclosure , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to provide greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; we need ordinary people , which are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind hypo@@ cris@@ per . &quot;
&quot; we need executives in the economy , which stand up and say : &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians , who recognize the problem and campa@@ ign@@ ing to end through laws this kind of in@@ contin@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; together , we can finally end the in@@ transparency , which now makes this kind of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I once almost kidn@@ apped , and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das . &quot;
&quot; a day after I completed my design study , I made a rear @-@ back . &quot;
a type in the red Maz@@ da remained at hand and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my master@@ pieces .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him on a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; when we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where do you see it today ? &quot;
&quot; he did the whole thing worse , &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; and I thought : &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I mean now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning it . I don &apos;t want to end in the trunk of a Maz@@ da ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard me say : &quot; I have a bub@@ ble . you can sleep in my living room .
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; Sh@@ h , how do I pray ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was in bed , I sti@@ ched to the blank@@ et and thought : &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I get out into it ? &quot;
a wild@@ card sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I got out of the bed , up to@@ kens to the door , and my sleeping door . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork which he had bought from me is today in his classroom . he is now teachers .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my point of view .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as a stran@@ ger , actually friends who are only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
people on my air mattress to host was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
&quot; we make a time jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost cl@@ ue , my ro@@ omm@@ ates and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I think creativity can make it , fear in fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I survived , how we could earn something about it . our apartment will stay in a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we set a site and green so called &quot; air mat@@ tresses and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests thir@@ st for us for 20 dollars on the air mattress to sleep in wooden floors .
they found it super and we too .
&quot; I &apos;m sure our che@@ eses @-@ ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ et tasted completely different , because we made them for our guests . &quot;
we returned to them through the whole city . when we rehear@@ sed our last guest and the door into the castle fell to rigi@@ d Brian and I went to .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time ?
things came in roles .
&quot; my former ro@@ omm@@ ates , N@@ ate Br@@ arc@@ y@@ ar@@ k , joined us as developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out whether one could make a business concept .
&quot; we presented our Invest@@ ors &apos; : &apos; we would like to create a website on which people post public pictures from their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closing , when visiting . &quot;
&quot; through the internet , they can then invite to to the wild people to stay with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
but they do not act .
&quot; no one who is still quite con@@ sol@@ ation , would invest in a store , the stran@@ gers allowed to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we as children have all learned that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
&quot; if one has a problem , one gets to the things that you can do well . we could des@@ ig@@ nen . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to di@@ fy objects , but now we wanted to create trust through design immense trust between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design be done so something ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a tast@@ ers which degree confidence we an@@ ked .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your phone into the hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
type your un@@ married mobile phone in your left rest .
&quot; this silent approach from panic , which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts , when they open the door the first time . &quot;
&quot; the only one , which is more personal than your mobile phone is your home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , you will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the scored mobile phone of a stran@@ ger in your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just something like who has actually Al Gor@@ es &apos;s mobile phone ?
could you pro@@ claim to Twitter for president of the President ?
you can return the phones now .
you now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we have changed a little detail about this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour has not been presented once with his name ; if he told , wh@@ ence he comes , how his dog or his children would say ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 admir@@ als that all say : &quot; he can really have very well @-@ liked mobil@@ es !
how would you feel then if you would have to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ designed feedback system strength@@ ens confidence .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to be negative re@@ ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents .
&quot; ultimately we decided to wait , until the host was host as well as a guest for their ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents before we set them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we have carried out a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how most likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are concerned with ages and residence . &quot;
little surprising we trust the people most that are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less trust we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social character .
exciting will add it if you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by Be@@ ur@@ departments .
&quot; if you have less than three Be@@ ur@@ es@@ sm@@ ents , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but , one has more than ten , changes all . &quot;
a good call sti@@ ff@@ ed simil@@ arities .
the right design can therefore help us to overcome some of our deep @-@ ro@@ oting curtains .
&quot; moreover , we continued that trust is dependent on how much one can get from oneself . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell a little about how to &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t get any answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells a lot about how , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is also rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal level of openness , such as &quot; &quot; w@@ ool art@@ works in your apartment ! I have been doing with my family vacation . &quot;
how can we create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text area to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on what subjects to write something .
&quot; our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help , overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards foreigners . &quot;
&quot; what we had not reck@@ oned , was the great amount of people who were more than willing to settle these prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
here you see how many people are entitled to complete our offer .
you can recognize three things .
firstly : incredibly good luck .
&quot; second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team . &quot;
&quot; third , a need , which had not been covered previously . &quot;
for us the business is very good .
naturally there are also times when not everything is smoothly running .
there were guests who have allowed un@@ allowed parties have been celebrated or d@@ well@@ ed .
hosts have guests in the rain .
in the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service . all calls come directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front when trust was broken .
there is nothing un@@ lim@@ mer@@ it than these calls . it already hur@@ ts when I just think of it .
&quot; the disappointment that h@@ ears in the voice of c@@ aller , was and will always be our biggest motivation to continue to improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , by 123 million t nights had only a fraction each problem . &quot;
for people trust each other rightly .
when confidence works , it can be amazed at the moment . &quot;
one of our guests made vacation in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host went to hospital .
he even ended blood for the necessary operation !
here is his review :
perfect house for travelers who tend to carry out activities to heart attack .
the area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Al@@ ej@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save life on a life , even though they don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; you will drive a hospital in hospital when you die , and wait while one gets a b@@ yp@@ ass . &quot;
&quot; because they do not want you feel lonely , they bring books by . &quot;
they can even stay longer without com@@ promising the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so naturally does not run every stay .
but these relations behind the pure money trans@@ action are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money trans@@ actions together ?
it is about an economic trade .
&quot; but it is now just the &quot; &quot; ten@@ ing &quot; &quot; industry to name , the thing is not justified . &quot;
Share Economy describes a trade where human relationships promises .
&quot; people put a part of themselves openly , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; if you travel today , this is easy to compare with Fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
what would be if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions ?
&quot; what if in any place you have visited , a group there will wait to show a thorough and one with a pub tour of which one has never heard of ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would like to create apartments from the ground up to living together ?
how would this look like ?
what if cities were to take on the idea of sharing ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us to society and relationships , instead of lon@@ eliness and sealing . &quot;
&quot; in Southern Cor@@ e@@ as capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that were included in the government . &quot;
were offered to residents . students who were looking for a ban
&quot; were taught to people whose children were educated . there were inc@@ ub@@ ators , were started . &quot;
to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . through our platform alone night 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries are being hosted by a stran@@ ger or even hosts .
the idea seems to be not so crazy as it was brought .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality was also previously mentioned .
there were already similar websites .
so why did our work exactly ?
&quot; apart from luck and tim@@ ing , we noticed that you can find the component of trust with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us transc@@ end deep @-@ root prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I find this amazing , &quot;
down@@ overwhelming .
I need to think about it when a red Maz@@ da goes by me .
we of course know that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if it was able to help us when it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or suppres@@ sed , a brain under@@ wear , a terrorist &quot;
or simply a delay in the safety check at the airport .
this is actually true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not speak to their native drivers .
&quot; for all those who have never met a Muslim , it is great to meet you . &quot;
I say to you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ;
a Mö@@ ller @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born . &quot;
I decided to do this .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ tre@@ ach me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual person , as some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to carry out my head@@ gear . &quot;
my femin@@ ist friend@@ ships were horri@@ fied : &quot; why oppressed you yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the Lus@@ tige was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and indeed with the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adjust myself a perfect and un@@ att@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not just received the faith of my parents .
I have signed with the Quran .
&quot; I read it , thought , asked about , doub@@ ted and believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened up with any reading of the corrupt .
the beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to the wines .
I realize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that somebody takes you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
this is how it feels like that .
&quot; later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the basically the &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had too late , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Eil@@ at . &quot; &quot;
&quot; then smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , men sp@@ ran@@ gen from the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned rapidly into rebellion .
why should you do something ?
&quot; I joined the TV channel and heard : &quot; ... Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ast@@ eries ... &quot; , &quot; ... &quot; Zer@@ bom@@ bers &quot; ... &quot; &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u turned me the actions of others from a civil war into a suspic@@ ious . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to go to a new city and start building up in the building . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I drove me -- when we went down -- so deep it went in my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims . &quot;
&quot; we moved into our apartment in our apartment , in a new city , where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then heard , saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Muslim organisations that said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d careful , &quot; &quot; cri@@ bes in well illuminated areas , &quot; &quot; disgu@@ sting you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday during that week -- the day when Muslims gather as a prayer .
&quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; do not go to this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered and I also heard of attacks to Muslims , or of people who held for Muslims , desc@@ ending and proposed for Muslims . &quot;
there were really brand@@ ro@@ vers on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should remain at home .
but something felt not right .
&quot; because people who have attacked this land , we have attacked our country . &quot;
I have been vict@@ orious the anger of the people on terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain itself constantly .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
these are the accus@@ ations that are tough .
&quot; nowadays , we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot;
when will we loose them ? &quot;
some people want to join Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tum@@ our in the body of the USA .
it is just the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a vi@@ cious tum@@ our as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ our only keeps you under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a life @-@ important organ . &quot;
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Er@@ sth@@ el@@ fer and Olympi@@ oni@@ on . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make safer ?
perhaps a few parking is free to stop but not the terror .
&quot; the regular visit to a mosque leads to view people &apos;s other faith @-@ toler@@ ant , and greater civil participation . &quot;
&quot; and as I told , the head of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently told , people will actually not be radi@@ cal@@ ised into mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
&quot; in the radi@@ cal@@ alization process , one noticed that it starts online . as a first person , the person of their church is cut , even by their family , so that the person believes that the patient is the true Muslims , and anyone who desp@@ ises their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor , or by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we need to keep the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some are still claiming to Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS is justified its brut@@ ality with the Quran . &quot;
&quot; as Muslims , as a Mother , as a man , I think we must do everything to stop a group as the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add to your imagination , when you acknowledge them as representatives of 1,6 billion believers . &quot;
thank you !
the IS has to do so much with Islam just like the K@@ u club club with Christianity .
both groups are claiming their ideology to their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
&quot; but if you thro@@ ws a look at it , it is not what they do in their &quot; &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures &quot; . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding I@@ mam told me recently an amazing story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because she had promised to join the IS . &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with which she talked , brought her to silence , and said her , her wrath , her sense of the injustice in the world , they would only bring it into trouble . &quot;
&quot; nothing inspired by anything and something that had given their anger mind , it was a main target for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts that you spoke a solution . &quot;
this I@@ mam established the connection with God and her community .
&quot; instead of protecting them for their anger , he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , kept her to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family concerns .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect anyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affects our democracy every day , on our thoughts of thoughts ? &quot;
&quot; one study -- actually show several neuro@@ scientific studies -- when we fear , pass at least three things . &quot;
&quot; we rather accept an authorized government system , con@@ form@@ ance and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study reveals : if you submit testing news , in which negative about Muslims reports , they voted more military attack on Muslim countries and the circum@@ c@@ ision of the Rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just a academic problem .
&quot; when you look at when the mood against Muslims follow the above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two choices periods .
&quot; thus , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to a Muslim terror as I expected it . &quot;
it can actually be a tool for mani@@ pulation of the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
the handling with Muslims is an early warning .
we might feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
&quot; in the assignment of coll@@ ectiv@@ ism , it is not only about to explain themselves . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple , who lived in chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; he was on the dental faculty , talented , much promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet , gr@@ est man , whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him and he showed her life cycle . she was aston@@ ished and said :
&quot; when is from my br@@ other@@ ly , such a versi@@ vely young man ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne in her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she was mur@@ dered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , which was in the afternoon to visit . he did it in their apartment , as with a execution after his statements against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he had eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we going to the mosque or were we safe at home ?
&quot; we had it and for us it was not an easy decision , for it was about what America would leave to our children : one that would be able to control us through fear , or one where we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we decided for the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we went well with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , drew my shoes off , went into prayer sh@@ alle , and what I saw , let me hold . &quot;
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
&quot; then the I@@ mam made an announcement expressed and was meant to welcome our guests , because half of the gathered Christians , Jews , Buddha and non @-@ credit@@ ors who came to attack , but to assist us . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I have been coll@@ ap@@ sed . &quot;
these people were there because they had courage and compassion panic and prejudi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you make the number safe ?
or will you join those who are my : we are better than that .
many thanks .
thanks beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have taken a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I ask myself , what do you say that you may hold a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a monument with dr@@ au@@ ght dr@@ au@@ ght with dr@@ au@@ ght , thus an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not f@@ ool you . I am completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I usually am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest study conducted on Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
they want prosperity for the family ; they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am not an exception in any respect .
&quot; if people seem like an exception to the rule , then often the rule is broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : many thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what started as a platform for craf@@ ting began , is in short before , a billion business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . possible this is made in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air saving &quot; &quot; setting up in our social consciousness , has built a autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France live a six meter high tower of 1 500 bricks . a few years ago , they started to fly with soap . &quot;
by em@@ bos@@ sing flying appliances high speed and acceleration in the narro@@ west room .
you can also build self @-@ resistant structures .
&quot; you have learned to carry bur@@ dens , treat with tur@@ mo@@ il and in general responding to nature laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you a few of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of the Pos@@ sible flight in the autonomous flight .
&quot; thus , a system aut@@ on@@ om works , it must know coll@@ ar where in the room the mobile objects are . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynam@@ ical Tas@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ springs of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each air engine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , calculations on board , which should do the machine . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available at the highest ec@@ e. g B. &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter , &quot;
&quot; a plane , which tries to beat two flies with a fl@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the down@@ ward flight , much more efficient than helic@@ opter in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; unlike most of the star@@ ters it can fluctu@@ ate , and thus has a great advantage with start@@ up and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
however there is always a down@@ side .
&quot; a restriction of tail@@ oring is that they are sensitive to tur@@ mo@@ il , such as windsurfing . &quot;
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air device doesn &apos;t matter how the optimal position can be reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often provide basic abstract questions that penet@@ rate at the core of the matter . &quot;
&quot; for instance , such a question would be : what is the smaller number of movable parts for controlled flights ? &quot;
there are practical reasons for trying to know the answer to such a question .
helic@@ opter is known as machines with thousand movable parts that join forces to hurt you .
decades ago they were able to fly remote @-@ controlled air @-@ controlled aircraft that only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear .
unfortunately we discovered that flying with just one works .
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically easiest way , it was recently invented . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ ap , hing@@ es and Quer@@ ru@@ der , no further actu@@ ator or insp@@ ectors , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechanical simple , inside the interior live very much , so it can fly stable and move in space over@@ all@@ u@@ dly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant algorith@@ m of the rear side . to bring it to catch , I have to do it right . &quot;
&quot; the probability to throw it exactly right when I see all of them is small , so I am showing you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ opo@@ inner is an exercise in gen@@ ü@@ g@@ lon@@ eliness , this machine is here , the Omni@@ copy here with his eight prop@@ ell@@ ors , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this flow ?
they see that it is not symmet@@ ric .
&quot; therefore , he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment . &quot;
&quot; thus , he will receive the outstanding capability , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction he is rot@@ ated or even as he rotating . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers from eight prop@@ ell@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; some is shown in models , the rest is learned right at flying . &quot;
see us this .
&quot; when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller engines .
this turns in clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
&quot; when you build them , they act like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ru@@ ple . &quot;
&quot; however , something going wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery , the machine can continue to fly , even if restricted . &quot;
we will demonstrate that by making a half plane .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic ill heat .
&quot; the great number of autonomous , co @-@ ordin@@ ated units enables a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we participated in South @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than a sli@@ ce of bread -- and equi@@ p them with local technology and algorithms .
&quot; each unit white , where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no ceiling . &quot;
hopefully motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine is there to practice on Broadway a flying lamp@@ shade .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to pre@@ di@@ ct the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types such as our work lies in the development and the creation of creativity .
&quot; it serves as a memory , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures allow it to form so spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; 1,3 billion years ago , in a very far distant galax@@ y , two black holes are each other ever faster , they walked so the mass of thre@@ e@@ ers in a ti@@ lt of pure energy in pure energy . &quot;
for this short moment they bri@@ ghten it bri@@ ghter than all stars along all the galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very great boy .
but their energy they not set in the form of light free --
we finally speak of black holes .
all the energy has been taken into space @-@ time frame itself and the universe explo@@ ded into gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
&quot; accordingly , we arrange the events in the meantime . &quot;
1.3 billion years ago it was just a multi@@ zel@@ liges life on the earth .
&quot; since then , the earth has brought forth some things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Saul , men , and -- God is with us even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group particularly gr@@ ac@@ eful -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , K@@ IP Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech - a huge laser det@@ ector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves resulting from col@@ li@@ zed black holes . &quot;
most they stopped for crazy .
&quot; but enough people realized them as crazy Gen@@ ies , so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades @-@ long development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector LI@@ GO : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ om@@ eter@@ - gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ gra@@ vit@@ ational Observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; during the next time the precision of LI@@ GO could be increased considerably , resulting in gaining performance . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced LI@@ GO .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , LI@@ GO was started to clear some smaller , stub@@ born issues . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , consuming the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ant black holes through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott H@@ ugh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the departure from my to@@ d@@ sick father .
&quot; basically , they were the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; all that which I had worked , is no longer Science F@@ ic@@ tion ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott H@@ ugh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist from black holes and their through observ@@ at@@ ories like LI@@ GO measurable signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a c@@ row in the texture of space and time .
&quot; on the tran@@ sit@@ ing the wave , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and into the other . &quot;
&quot; for understanding , faculty in courses for rel@@ ativ@@ ep@@ tic theory often lead to a correct dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and dust , stretching and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each of us was stretched on the waves of the waves , and sealed the stretching of an average person was 10 high @-@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this is called 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 Ther@@ e@@ fore one explained the LI@@ GO staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometres long laser det@@ ector , and this is absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thousands of the radius of an atomic kernel . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about gravity
&quot; description K@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder LI@@ GO@@ s that are hunting for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties when construction such det@@ ectors are vast . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are sublime and with the support of the public , certainly all barriers will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to LI@@ GO . Scott claims , LI@@ GO is more than an eye than an eye . &quot;
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial excer@@ pts , the size of your mobile phones . &quot;
this is quite handy . because in this way you can create an image or a map of things by using several points of upcoming light around you .
in pots it is different .
audi@@ ble notes have a wave @-@ length of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things which give you a lot of thing : &quot;
the face of your child is approximately .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain properties such as key and height , rhythm and volume to close the history behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , speaks straight Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; du@@ mm@@ ers Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot produce simple pictures of objects in a space with them .
&quot; but by watching the waves in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least lie for LI@@ GO the common frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
&quot; so when we convert wav@@ el@@ uster in bow@@ ls , we can speak the space literally . &quot;
&quot; the gravity to listen , can tell us about a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , my colleague Scott has already been busy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rot@@ atable holes , circul@@ ates simply : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turn the two body very fast , you hear the same circle with an additional audio change . it sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement of movement , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date , which at least I have to never forget - heard LI@@ GO : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which can turn around as fast as the sticks of your mix@@ er . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , revol@@ ve a hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we heard it .
therein lies the permanent significance of LI@@ GO .
&quot; LI@@ GO opens up a completely new way to study the Al@@ ls , as it was never before possible . &quot;
on this road we can listen to the space and the invisible .
much in space can we see -- practical or basically -- not visible .
&quot; a super nova , for example . I would like to know why mascul@@ ine stars would explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the space .
&quot; but the exciting physical processes happen at the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers from iron , carbon and si@@ lic@@ on . &quot;
we will never go through since these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be more transparent glass . the Ur@@ b@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the Al@@ ls , but we will never see it , since the judgment is covered by his own offspring . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; most importantly : I am optim@@ istic that we have never seen in all things that we have never seen before , and of which we have no idea of what we can only discover . &quot;
&quot; in fact , LI@@ GO found equal in the first run things we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that have observed black holes , like LI@@ GO they observed , are the Dinosau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are so called the sp@@ ri@@ cher for our arche@@ ological work . &quot;
&quot; LI@@ GO allows us to completely different perspectives on the events in space , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is now to be as brave as possible .
&quot; thanks to LI@@ GO , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circulation of cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ at@@ ories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ at@@ ories on earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than to listen to the urine ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment out .
one year I would say to all &apos; yes ! &apos; to say that I was afraid .
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , I took me in unpleasant situations , I forced me to say yes . &quot;
would I like to speak in the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
would I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
who wanted to start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly that to do , w@@ ov@@ or I feared , rec@@ ti@@ fy my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , speeches to hold , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a certain yes , that my life completely changed , on an un@@ expect@@ ant art . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , called for un@@ explained reasons all &quot; kitt@@ ens &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; cookies , I need milk for my beak . &quot;
she asked me once I could play with her when I was just on the go . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; with a new attitude in my family . from there I s@@ ed@@ ed me to always play with them once you ask me . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I am saying yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I feel very much . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , to my children , on our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has a surprising force @-@ effect : only recently , I fully understood that the &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; was saved to play with my children my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think about things that awak@@ ens up to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I Cre@@ ole TV . I reproduce television .
I do television , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for spending 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours television . three to four Shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
&quot; each program offers hundreds of jobs , which previously did not exist . &quot;
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days at four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars television , four television programs , three days TV , three rounds , three episodes , 15 episodes , 15 episodes , 15 episodes , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television , &quot;
350 million dollars for one season .
in America run my television series on Thursday night .
over the world my series running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spect@@ ators .
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are ship@@ ments that I myself create , and not only produced , so I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans at the camp@@ fire and to tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours TV , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire , which are around the world . &quot;
do you know who that still makes ?
&quot; no one , this is why I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I would not like to impress you with it .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I tell you so that all of you who work so hard whether you are now a company , a country or a household , making me serious if I say about work , so you understand that I am not only on the computer and f@@ antasi@@ zing , and it &apos;s true when I say , I understand that it is not going to dream with a dre@@ am@@ job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , everything reality , all our blood , everything swe@@ at -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m working much , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
&quot; it is when I set troops up , when I got troops on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; thus , one portr@@ ays a high tone , lie@@ p a marathon . &quot;
it feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ern@@ al , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the bu@@ zz . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working is going well .
&quot; a sums begins in my head , and it grows and growing , and the bu@@ zz is li@@ stens to a busy road that I could drive for ever . &quot;
&quot; many people take it when I kiss them the bu@@ zz , that I may speak of writing , that the writing was prepared for me . &quot;
don &apos;t understand me wrong you do it .
&quot; but the bu@@ zz -- when I started working with television production , when I began to work and make working , build and working together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this bu@@ zz . the bu@@ zz ! &quot;
the sums is more than writing .
the sums of action is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz then you cannot strive for size .
&quot; feeling not to be different compared to size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the bu@@ zz .
or maybe it also means a work@@ a@@ holic .
maybe it is genius .
maybe it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I do not know .
&quot; I know only that I am not for the failure , and I just know that I love the bu@@ zz . &quot;
&quot; I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I will not ask it into question . &quot;
&quot; to make a clear : the more successful I will ever more episodes , the more hiber@@ nation , the more work there are , the more things simultaneously , the more observe me , the more I write history , the more expectations . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to succeed , the more you have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the country , I managed , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the sums , the bu@@ zz . &quot;
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the bu@@ zz . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I only this bu@@ zz ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
&quot; revised , exagger@@ ated , exagger@@ ated , hidden . &quot;
the sums stopped .
now my three daughters to the truth are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth that their mother is a single working titles .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; cookies , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Country . &quot;
there are the children of a tit@@ ans .
you are Baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the bu@@ zz stopped . &quot;
the bu@@ zz of the motor was framed .
I loved my job not anymore . the engine was out .
the sums did not come back .
my sums was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , no Reu@@ ben , no Reu@@ ben , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan sleeps , does not give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a pre @-@ show Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , which one loves , suddenly er@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l you out , blocks from the author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you are doing , you are doing what you do to be a teacher , a painter , Bill Gates , one loves to be a painter , a painter , Bill Gates , and knows how the bu@@ zz feels , if the sums stops , who is then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart is listening , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then I imagine my &quot; southern states @-@ wa@@ it@@ ress . &quot;
&quot; I am on the way out , late , and she says : &quot; Mama , mag@@ st you play ? &quot;
and I will no say NO to be aware of two things :
&quot; first , I have to say Yes to all and secondly , she called me not . &quot;
you call anyone more &quot; cookies . &quot;
when is that happening ?
&quot; I delay it when I am Titan am and my bu@@ zz , and here everything changes my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says : &quot; Mama , mag@@ st you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special .
&quot; we play and her sisters encounter this , we lau@@ gh a lot and I read quite dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding , because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ eliness and lack of the mar@@ ches , I can do nothing , except for . &quot;
I am focused .
I am silent .
&quot; the country , which I managed , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists is sti@@ cky finger and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax , and the song , in which it leaves slo@@ gans , or whatever the girl in &quot; &quot; The king@@ gin &quot; . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so scar@@ cely that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me does not solve .
a mental door goes on and an energy club comes in .
&quot; and that not immediately , but it happens , it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz comes slowly back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
not the bu@@ zz but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel as if I know a magical secret .
but let us remain at the same thing .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the bu@@ zz , the labour @-@ consumption , the tit@@ anium @-@ consumption , that is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; when I ask you who you are , when I tell you who I am when I describe myself using ship@@ ments and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is . &quot;
the sums is not force and it is non @-@ specific .
it is dependent on joy .
the real amount is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz is the current which is of life &apos;s lust .
the real amount is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real bu@@ zz ignored the pressure of history , which did @-@ run tasks , anticip@@ ation and pressure . &quot;
the real sums is simple and original .
&quot; the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but maybe I whis@@ per@@ ed to God the wrong words because what God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is simply love .
we all need a bit more love , a lot more love . &quot;
&quot; once my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I make this as a rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ a@@ holic of any debt . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I am not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
playing is not different to me as they work .
the truth is hur@@ ting ;
but I don &apos;t like it to play .
&quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I prefer to work at work as a whole .
&quot; this con@@ fes@@ sion is painful , because what a man prefer to be considered to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; time honest , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we r@@ asen in the garden around , and back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we d@@ burst rop@@ es .
&quot; I feel mainly sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and confused . &quot;
I always go to my mobile phone .
yet it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sums of the universe fulfilled me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever heard with playing ?
you can also ! tell them too yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you keep me for na@@ ï@@ ve for a meeting .
you probably have right but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et @-@ show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me , until they were magni@@ fied that they want something else . &quot;
&quot; there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes I will replace a Marien@@ bad or K@@ eks .
&quot; and speak my teen @-@ daughter whole 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more you need not need it . &quot;
&quot; everyone can set 15 minutes by the piece , even on a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes at the piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
the day is short : dinner the kids will bed ready .
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . there must not be the children . it is true to have the bu@@ zz to have a place for his soul needs . &quot;
it is not about playing with your own children . it is about joy
about the &quot; games &quot; in general .
treat yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it out .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I shy and I victories . friends meet , books read , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; just for everything I have given up , when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training , when I wanted to meet myself more and more . &quot;
15 Min@@ utes a piece why not full 15 minutes indul@@ ge ?
what can it be wrong ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the sums seems to return then if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens up and I find myself again in my office . I hear a well @-@ known melody , it fills me and my soul . I listen to new ideas . I use it to a full swing and I love my work again . &quot;
&quot; I like the bu@@ zz , but I do not love it . &quot;
I do not need it .
I am not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more . &quot;
soap fade and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my bu@@ zz .
the amount of life .
the amount of love .
&quot; the amount of labour is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; it is me sn@@ ap that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and for more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire still burn .
&quot; the more I play , the more happ@@ ier , I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clear@@ er is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the land , I managed , the marathon I run , the tro@@ can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the sums , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz : the bu@@ zz of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sums , the more this unusual , be@@ aming , naked and new feeling of living in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sums , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am author , I think about things , I awake you to life . &quot;
&quot; that belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dre@@ am@@ job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; yes &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; said to less work and for more games . &quot;
tit@@ ans have no chance .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am a neurolog@@ ist .
as most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trag@@ e@@ dies .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke or after an automobile accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , as opposed to other bodily organs , a very low ability to self healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe violation of the central nervous system , people often have a permanent , heavy disability . &quot;
that is probably the reason why I have got functional neuro@@ surgical procedure .
what is a Func@@ tional neurolog@@ ist ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions .
&quot; surely they have heard of one of the most famous , the &quot; underground stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one can influence an electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurological function has improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Par@@ kin@@ son who suffered severe tre@@ m@@ bling and heavy pain .
Neuro@@ modul@@ ation does not mean Ne@@ uro healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
&quot; I would like to show you , that we are very close to it . &quot;
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
&quot; at the time , I was leading wa@@ it@@ ist and worked the day and night in the staff . &quot;
often I cat@@ ered patients with sk@@ ull @-@ deer @-@ trau@@ ma .
they need to imagine that at sk@@ ull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a the brain cr@@ ashed and the sk@@ ull @-@ pressure .
&quot; to save life , you have to dimin@@ ish the cran@@ ial pressure . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you sometimes have to remove a part of bra@@ zed brain . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing the bra@@ zed brain mass , we decided to analyze the brain with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to leave cells from a tissue , is comparable with very small children that are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the proper diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to thri@@ ve them . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it managed by Jean @-@ François .
this was what he saw under his micro@@ scope .
it was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you still know from the biot@@ ology , that stem cells are un@@ ri@@ pe cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has tri@@ bal cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small n@@ ischen of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery .
we made a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are im@@ mor@@ tal .
but these cells stopped differently .
they shared slowly and after a couple of weeks they were even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , wei@@ rd cell population that saw like stem cells but stopped differently . &quot;
we needed long to understand where they came .
it is from these cells .
these blue and red cells hot dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you make 4 % of our large @-@ min@@ e@@ rin@@ se cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they ensure the h@@ itting of the brain .
but why are they staying for us ?
we do not know that .
&quot; we believe they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find it in higher concentr@@ ations near brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so certain .
&quot; however , one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
&quot; we are facing a potential cell source , which allows brain healing . &quot;
this we had to prove .
&quot; so , we decided to develop an experiment . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to take a piece of brain mass of the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area , and then the cells want to cultiv@@ ate the exact same way as Jean @-@ François did . &quot;
and they can then highlight them in the brain to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we re@@ impl@@ anted them at the des@@ erts of the same individual . &quot;
we call the autonomous transpl@@ ant -- auto@@ ot@@ ran@@ spl@@ antation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we pass these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re@@ impl@@ anted the same cells in dig@@ ging brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario we impl@@ anted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they will not go there , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario we have an injury to , and re@@ impl@@ anted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained behind them -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been impl@@ anted .
&quot; proof that they show are these small points . these are the cells , which we f@@ lowed in vit@@ ro , in the culture . &quot;
here we could not stop .
can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a fantasy ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual function task .
you had to take the pell@@ ets by one tablet .
they made it very well .
&quot; as they had achieved a stable skill level , the last we had in the mot@@ ori@@ zed Cor@@ tex the Hand@@ mot@@ or@@ ic area . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in people , they recovered spont@@ aneously to some degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plasti@@ fic@@ ated brain mechanisms . they are rec@@ u@@ perate to some degree just as they did in the monkey .
&quot; when we were sure the monkey has reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we impl@@ anted its own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left side they see the monkey , which arose spont@@ aneously . &quot;
it can fur@@ nish about 40 % to 50 % of its initial performance from before injury .
it is not that precise and not so fast .
&quot; now you see , when we re@@ impl@@ anted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the plant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
&quot; since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can make them free@@ zing and later use .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ology models , for example at Par@@ kin@@ son . &quot;
but our dream is still to impl@@ ant them in man .
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal itself .
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I am sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need it . &quot;
I will definitely .
&quot; of course , the question of what the greatest obstacles are before they can start clinical trials at the people . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results you have to fill about two kil@@ ograms of papers and forms , in order to run these kinds of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start of clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes to get to the hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : this is difficult to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study . &quot;
will it allow us to allow the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , you have to apply this to a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study . &quot;
one has to really suggest that it is useful before you can offer this treatment every one .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as natural .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality , but as invent@@ ories of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ changing opponents .
we believe that capitalism inev@@ itably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great rep@@ lica in Beijing have undoubtedly proven that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; indeed , democracy comes with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- our choices -- not to influence austerity , which have been realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my dear friends who would be repeated if they would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; please , together with me , to believe again to believe Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ ective democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies will be mer@@ ged , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction , which is currently threatened by our economies . &quot;
&quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; tw@@ ins &quot; &quot; par@@ adox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and know him as the Schul@@ den@@ berg , who casts its long shadow over the U.S. , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognise the Schul@@ den@@ berg , &quot;
but few recognize their senses .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , that belongs to b@@ illed sa@@ vers and corporations , however , to invest there where it would be productive and income could be put together with which one needed humanity &apos;s debt and also to produce all the things that humanity urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and the euro zone , 3.4 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollars to invest in all the wealth produced , such as industrial buildings , schools , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollar sounds like much money , until one compar@@ es up to the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ llion US dollars , which were up at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did except the stock exchange and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debts and un@@ productive capital will form the twin @-@ training summit , which are not out of the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result will be stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the US , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low @-@ economic demand that would not invest in which they would not invest . just like O@@ edi@@ pus father , who would not invest it , that his son would kill him if he will grow , &quot;
&quot; un@@ meant the circumstances bring about , that led him kill him . &quot;
this is my hair with capitalism --
&quot; its extremely mis@@ chi@@ der@@ ous Art All the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies , which are decisive for saving the Earth . &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
I think about . but before we proceed : what do we mean by democracy ?
&quot; Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the social form , in which the Free and the poor as a majority control the government . &quot;
the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy ended naturally too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to min@@ ate the significance of ath@@ en@@ ic democracy due to these proportions . &quot;
&quot; the decision makers at the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they were the working poor , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive that they gave them the right to political fellow @-@ determination in questions of the state of citizenship . &quot;
ath@@ en@@ ic democracy is not kept for a long time --
&quot; like a candle , the very bright lights , it is also fast hidden . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal democratic democr@@ acies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was concentrated on the free citizens and the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for the ruling class . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy appeared only when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible , and the democratic process has entered into politics , while the economy - thus the world of corporations - a more democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present democr@@ acies since the time , at which this separation of politics and economy began , an un@@ inherited struggle between the two , through the economy gradually under@@ mines the policy . &quot;
wonder why the politicians are no longer like this ?
it is not up to a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is because that today in the government can be in the government , and still not in power because power from politics in the economy is inter@@ woven and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my ha@@ iling with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is about like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , which has so sustainable the animals , of which they nour@@ ished , dec@@ imal number , that they are star@@ red at the end . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is similar to the economy that has spread the politics so far from the self @-@ causing economic crisis . the power of the corporations grows , political goods are de@@ valu@@ ated , increasing the economic demand and the managing directors of the corporations are fright@@ ened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful the capitalism the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; s@@ ells out of democracy , the higher the Twin Towers , and the greater the waste of human labour power and of the welfare of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy again and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keep control , aside from the exclusion of slaves , the women and the foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go any sun .
the lesson from the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only reg@@ ain a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new kinds of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing Ni@@ ed@@ rig@@ wage employees through automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as the economy and politics are separate areas , autom@@ ating the tw@@ ins are higher , the wast@@ age , and the social conflicts are deeper , as I think -- in countries like China will come . &quot;
&quot; we must therefore re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and thereby pay attention to the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a disease surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that lets the film &quot; matrix &quot; like a documentation . &quot;
&quot; the question is therefore not whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements that he has brought forth , will survive . &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is dis@@ solved by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that of the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve the people and humans their energy into the study of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life . &quot;
I believe we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so what br@@ äu@@ er it , how could it look to have this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation I would like to give you , in all the short , some examples call . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies : ask yourself a capital market in which you earn money , while you work and in which your capital follows you from a job to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
then all income from capital comes from capital and dis@@ solve and the concept of wage labor is totally out@@ dated .
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but they do not work in it , and employees that work there . no exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and expenses , and ultimately not em@@ itting tw@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in the area of global political economy , please note that our national currencies would have a free @-@ free exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; continue to imagine that the entire world trade in this currency will be tr@@ aded -- we call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; , &quot; and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the merch@@ ant of each country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that these funds are inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investments are r@@ ar . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that there was no technical means at that time .
&quot; today , we have them , especially in front of the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world that I describe to you is at the same time liber@@ ally , in which it was privileged people pre@@ fers , and Marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the cer@@ eals of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ ans , globally key@@ n@@ esi@@ ans . &quot;
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
will we aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we fail in a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar to yst@@ ro@@ scopy ?
the answer depends on how to work together politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we are doing it better democr@@ atically . &quot;
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... we do not , the technological development will produce a massive decline of the overall economic demand that Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers referred to as &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agnation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next one , as we are currently experiencing it , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democr@@ acies but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ ally democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as well as Hay@@ ek , so I am a liber@@ t@@ ary Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also fully wir@@ r . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are at ease too . &quot;
Y@@ V : if you do not get wir@@ r you don &apos;t think enough .
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical statement -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein that said it . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday during the dinner of the speakers , you have said very clearly what you hold from the sight of the West on China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the sem@@ bl@@ ance of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy on politics during the area where most of them play , -- the area of the economy -- a completely non @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in certain ways , if I may say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resem@@ bles the Great Britain of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- Please remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ ale , as John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was very skep@@ tical as regards the democratic development .
&quot; what can be observed in China now , very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; to do so , China now throw what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experiences as a finance minister of Greece in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I ex@@ hor@@ ted that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very disappointing , because we had the opportunity to start with the eurozone a new beginning , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece but the eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely , we say goodbye to the self @-@ suff@@ iciency , and the perpet@@ ual denial means that a massive sealing of the eurozone ran through the eurozone and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened with the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity to open on the Greek proposal - by the way , the first suggestion that denial was reve@@ aling to this denial -- &quot;
&quot; it was correct to do . unfortunately , the powers have chosen within the euro zone , within the European group , continues to pay the denial . &quot;
&quot; but , you know what comes . &quot;
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to obtain an economic system that is not vital through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , you might be able to delay a while , but when then the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you look ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- Ern@@ est ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any minister there , which claims after 6 months in office , especially in such a tense situation , he did not make mistakes , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake has been to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
&quot; I believed that there was an honest interest on the pages of credit@@ ors , to find a common solution . &quot;
but that was not .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the in@@ spec@@ tions , which ran through the eurozone . &quot;
they did not want to conc@@ ede that they have led a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
that is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression &quot; .
&quot; none of the Troika &apos;s credit@@ ors has imposed us this policy , and a &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sy mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : in spite of all that , and despite the aggressive table of talks , you still seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming to someone who lives and loves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive . &quot;
&quot; for if they do not survive , the un@@ le@@ ased fly forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; it will not be disast@@ rous for Europe , but for the global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; when we turn ourselves to the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what appears to me , it will also be as well as for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are in this point wrong .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you very much that you were at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; Roy Price have never heard most yet , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate @-@ minute minutes of your life on 19th April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for so many of you . &quot;
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is introduc@@ tory employed at Amazon Studios ;
the TV @-@ production firm of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ geh@@ og@@ ist and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; films , TV , technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for giving the shows and the content to the Amazon , the Amazon will produce . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can not choose any one .
&quot; he must find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are on the right side of this turn . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the evaluation of more than 2,500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows this review . &quot;
&quot; if your show is rated at nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows how &quot; breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addi@@ ctive , where , after having seen a season , your brain ask : &quot; &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what happens at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you have a special intelligence to under@@ go &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the middle output , the average television -- the shows that neither good nor bad , they simply do not delight . &quot;
so he must make sure he really is on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is available , and of course it is also the first time Amazon as a little power , therefore Roy wants nothing to risk . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; it requires guaranteed success , so he will hold a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and choosing eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode each of these shows and puts them online where everyone can watch everyone free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon there is anything else out , one gets too , right ? &quot;
millions of viewers check out these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know they will be observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are observed by Roy and his team who will record everything .
&quot; when you record the show , when you start p@@ auses , which parts you can ski@@ p or check again . &quot;
&quot; they collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show them to produce . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and it results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
do someone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that many of these show can remember because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only a average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this turn is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House has been at 7,5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time with another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it but he does something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a competition , he and his team comp@@ elled the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x spect@@ ators , so reviews that give them the shows , what shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then use this data to find out these small details about the spect@@ ators : which shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a wagon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series of a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has made a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
it has two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data sealed . &quot;
they combine this many data with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what lies that ?
because logic shows somehow that this should work with everything .
&quot; if one coll@@ ects millions of data for a decision , which one meets , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
it has 200 years of statistics than back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; what you can expect is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; when data analysis is not working , this is something fright@@ ening because we live in a time in which we draw more and more to statistics in order to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; nobody . OK , this is even good . &quot;
multi @-@ health system is a software company and I hope that nobody will ever get in touch with this software . come in touch with this software you are in prison .
&quot; if someone is here in the United States in prison , and to dism@@ iss@@ al , it is probably that the data analysis is used in this company to determine whether an dism@@ iss@@ al is made or not . &quot;
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of choosing whether a show will be good or bad it will be decided if a person will be good or bad .
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , this can be genuine , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
&quot; this is not always the best results , it is not that a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data . &quot;
also the data sealed can be found here .
&quot; yes , even Google is making mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 Google announced that by data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the lim@@ b way , they can say -- through data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success did in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked just one year after year , until it is no longer working , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it just does not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the release in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data sealed businesses such as Amazon and Google abuse sometimes something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data flows significantly in decisions of life -- on the workplace , in law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
&quot; so , we would prefer to make sure data are helpful . &quot;
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very clever people use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a medicine . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; have you ever encountered a complex problem , do you mostly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , you put this problem into its parts , so that you can analyze the parts again ; as a second , you put the items again to summar@@ ise a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and set it together again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help and understand a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to merge the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we possess it all : our brain .
&quot; when there is something where the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again merge again , even if the information is incomplete , to then hit a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of a expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe it was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have data and understanding where they also go into the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their public what they would otherwise have been capable of . but the decision to take all of these parts again , and make a show like &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; which does not stand in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant they entered a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they use the data to control all their decisions , first as they fores@@ ee to TV ideas while they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; this is what we say to us . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired outcome .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful them are , data are just a tool and not to forget that , this device is pretty useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there were data , this was the tool for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it is also called &apos; Magic 8 Ball &apos; . it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no matter you just need to shake the ball in order to get an answer . &quot; most probably &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will start it later with a technology demo .
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions taken in my life before I would have to listen to the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you of course know , when you have the data available , you want to replace them by something much more extrac@@ ted , such as data analysis , in order to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; perhaps the ball is kl@@ ü@@ ger and kl@@ ü@@ ger , and ultimately it is up to us to make decisions if we want something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that , despite the large amount of data still pays off , decisions to meet , an expert in what you are doing , and risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks beautiful .
