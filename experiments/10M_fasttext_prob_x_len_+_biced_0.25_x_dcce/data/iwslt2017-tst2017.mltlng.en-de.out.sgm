<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he was striking that NSA was illegal Telefones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence surgery, in which the CIA was literally blows up for an atomic bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if the crazy sounds, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an unbelievable story.</seg>
<seg id="8">"but do you know, if the chapters did not fall?"</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for nearly 10 years, the government has been established against Risen, and called on it to call its innumerable sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this move, he became a symbol of the pattern of government, whistle-blowers and journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Council, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media has not received this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so as the government at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did already before him, he refused, and said that he would prefer to go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the process, something exceptional."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they were ready for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporter and sources can hide themselves less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rather than fail and remises to the statements, you could do the digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so, the investigators, without his consent, his phone-wise secretly is concerned,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just as his e-mail data, financial and banking information, his credit date, and even travel-wise with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblowers and Risens source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect himself from his head, whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary more condemns more than all the U.S. governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is a lot about their work as secretly."</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblowers to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we set the press work to be protected by the first constitutional, because the government has more and more possibilities to spspout all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology of the government allows to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed, they are able to contact them from the moment, rather than in retrospect, in the witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software, which has not yet been written as Risen, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or telephone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is Securedrop, an open source of source system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by us, named Aaron Swartz, and is today approved by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of mail an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents to upload or send information, just as with any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no more information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">"SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole, to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world develop new spy technologies that endanger us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to us to make sure that not only technology denominator like Edward Snowden have a possibility, misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the lack of abnormalities in the supply of soldiers is modest and reported by crowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm for the sigh water of Flint proposes. or a Wallstreet insider that warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on 3. April 2016, the largest data sheet of history was released.] [the" Panama Papers "contained [the" Panama Papers "," [we have hidden Robert Palmer of Global Witness in tax havens.] This week we have published news about a Leck of 11 million documents of the law firm in Panama's law firm Fonseca. "</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as mosbags Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works, as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"also, there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad briefing firms in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia president Vladimir Putin guides, through a close friend of child collagen, a famous Cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people, and others who are waiting to wait for the next release, and to the next uncovered documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of a agency grilled or a John-Grisham.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems crying from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we think about what?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is, if the rich and powerful ones are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all of paying all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, this disclosure is phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in all over the world, media and leading politicians, such as the secret tax havens are used by a few of them to hide and devourers -- something that we have been discussing and reveal for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seems very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it like a matrjoschcape.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind this prayer."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for penal and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports of this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably because there have been no famous Americans in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle that these tax havens work, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a datleck of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples to have the connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some US states you need less information to give less information to start a company than to obtain a librarian credit."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of incontinence in the US has allowed to scales debt to school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has scams any more susceptible investors to cut off.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">"so, we sent an covered investigation into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan."</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigators gave himself a african minister, bringing the money into the United States to buy a house, a Yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"so we really shocked it really that all of them have made suggestions for our investigators, how he could be transferred to his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all pre-preaching. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course no money has been handed over to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has been subjected to our covert proposals.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single leader in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, which is established by the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound all very sorbers, as if we could not do anything against it; as if nothing ever had ever changed, as if it is always the rich and powerful ones."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a born Optimist, I really see that a lot has begun to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years we have seen pre-violations for more transparency in which the owners of companies are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic took political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has been recorded in the central registers at the national level, who really is behind firms in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging here.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliament, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how this Panama disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to provide greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people, which are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind hypocrisper."</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need executives in the economy, which stand up and say:" "transparency is not good for business." ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians, who recognize the problem and campaigning to end through laws this kind of incontinence."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together, we can finally end the intransparency, which now makes this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I once almost kidnapped, and in the trunk of a red Mazdas."</seg>
<seg id="97">"a day after I completed my design study, I made a rear-back."</seg>
<seg id="98">A type in the red Mazda remained at hand and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my masterpieces.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"when we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where do you see it today?"</seg>
<seg id="104">"he did the whole thing worse," I don't know. "</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought:" "Oh, man!"</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I mean now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really is planning it. I don't want to end in the trunk of a Mazda!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard me say: "I have a bubble. you can sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," Shh, how do I pray? "</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was in bed, I stiched to the blanket and thought:" "Oh man! what did I get out into it?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A wildcard sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I got out of the bed, up tokens to the door, and my sleeping door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork which he had bought from me is today in his classroom. he is now teachers.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as a stranger, actually friends who are only waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my air mattress to host was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">"we make a time jump, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost clue, my roommates and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I think creativity can make it, fear in fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky:" Brian, I survived, how we could earn something about it. our apartment will stay in a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We set a site and green so called "air mattresses and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests thirst for us for 20 dollars on the air mattress to sleep in wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I'm sure our cheeses-ham-Omelet tasted completely different, because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">We returned to them through the whole city. when we rehearsed our last guest and the door into the castle fell to rigid Brian and I went to.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came in roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommates, Nate Brarcyark, joined us as developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether one could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented our Investors': 'we would like to create a website on which people post public pictures from their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closing, when visiting."</seg>
<seg id="139">"through the internet, they can then invite to to the wild people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not act.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still quite consolation, would invest in a store, the strangers allowed to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if one has a problem, one gets to the things that you can do well. we could designen."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to dify objects, but now we wanted to create trust through design immense trust between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be done so something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a tasters which degree confidence we anked.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your unmarried mobile phone in your left rest.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this silent approach from panic, which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts, when they open the door the first time."</seg>
<seg id="158">"the only one, which is more personal than your mobile phone is your home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, you will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the scored mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just something like who has actually Al Gores's mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you proclaim to Twitter for president of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbour has not been presented once with his name; if he told, whence he comes, how his dog or his children would say?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 admirals that all say: "he can really have very well-liked mobiles!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel then if you would have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-designed feedback system strengthens confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to be negative reassessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"ultimately we decided to wait, until the host was host as well as a guest for their assessments before we set them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we have carried out a study with Stanford. we examined how most likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are concerned with ages and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we trust the people most that are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less trust we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social character.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting will add it if you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by Beurdepartments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three Beuressments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but, one has more than ten, changes all."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good call stiffed similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can therefore help us to overcome some of our deep-rooting curtains.</seg>
<seg id="186">"moreover, we continued that trust is dependent on how much one can get from oneself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell a little about how to" "Hi!" "you don't get any answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells a lot about how, for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is also rather not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal level of openness, such as" "wool artworks in your apartment! I have been doing with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text area to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on what subjects to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">"our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help, overcome our prejudices towards foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="194">"what we had not reckoned, was the great amount of people who were more than willing to settle these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people are entitled to complete our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">Firstly: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">"second, the tireless work of our team."</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a need, which had not been covered previously."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">Naturally there are also times when not everything is smoothly running.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have allowed unallowed parties have been celebrated or dwelled.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">In the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service. all calls come directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing unlimmerit than these calls. it already hurts when I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that hears in the voice of caller, was and will always be our biggest motivation to continue to improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, by 123 million t nights had only a fraction each problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">When confidence works, it can be amazed at the moment. "</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made vacation in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host went to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his review:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who tend to carry out activities to heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save life on a life, even though they don't know."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you will drive a hospital in hospital when you die, and wait while one gets a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they do not want you feel lonely, they bring books by."</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without compromising the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So naturally does not run every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is now just the" "tening" "industry to name, the thing is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade where human relationships promises.</seg>
<seg id="229">"people put a part of themselves openly, and that changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="230">"if you travel today, this is easy to compare with Fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">What would be if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if in any place you have visited, a group there will wait to show a thorough and one with a pub tour of which one has never heard of;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to create apartments from the ground up to living together?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities were to take on the idea of sharing?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us to society and relationships, instead of loneliness and sealing."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in Southern Coreas capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces that were included in the government."</seg>
<seg id="240">Were offered to residents. students who were looking for a ban</seg>
<seg id="241">"were taught to people whose children were educated. there were incubators, were started."</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the share economy. through our platform alone night 785 000 people in 191 countries are being hosted by a stranger or even hosts.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be not so crazy as it was brought.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also previously mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work exactly?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we noticed that you can find the component of trust with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us transcend deep-root prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find this amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Downoverwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I need to think about it when a red Mazda goes by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We of course know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it was able to help us when it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, a brain underwear, a terrorist"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the safety check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is actually true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak to their native drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for all those who have never met a Muslim, it is great to meet you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I say to you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted;</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möller-Fitness-Fanatikerin</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outreach me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as homosexual person, as some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to carry out my headgear."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friendships were horrified: "why oppressed you yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the Lustige was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, and indeed with the pressure I felt as 17-year-old, to adjust myself a perfect and unattable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not just received the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have signed with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, asked about, doubted and believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow dedication that deepened up with any reading of the corrupt.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to the wines.</seg>
<seg id="285">I realize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"did you ever feel that somebody takes you, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in the basically the" "Egyptian-American Dream." "</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had too late, looked at the screen and saw the word" Eilat. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"then smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, men sprangen from the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned rapidly into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I joined the TV channel and heard:"... Muslim terrorists "..."... "... in the name of Islam..."... "..." "asteries...", "..." Zerbombers "..." "</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country attacked, but in the Nu turned me the actions of others from a civil war into a suspicious."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to go to a new city and start building up in the building."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I drove me -- when we went down -- so deep it went in my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved into our apartment in our apartment, in a new city, where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then heard, saw and read the warnings of the national Muslim organisations that said:" be vigilant, "" Seid careful, "" cribes in well illuminated areas, "" disgusting you not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday during that week -- the day when Muslims gather as a prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" do not go to this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal. "</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks to Muslims, or of people who held for Muslims, descending and proposed for Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really brandrovers on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should remain at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not right.</seg>
<seg id="314">"because people who have attacked this land, we have attacked our country."</seg>
<seg id="315">I have been victorious the anger of the people on terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain itself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations that are tough.</seg>
<seg id="320">"nowadays, we can actually say people:" there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we loose them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to join Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumour in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is just the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a vicious tumour as a whole and a benign tumour only keeps you under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a life-important organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, Ersthelfer and Olympionion. "</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">Perhaps a few parking is free to stop but not the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit to a mosque leads to view people's other faith-tolerant, and greater civil participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as I told, the head of the police in the area of Washington, DC recently told, people will actually not be radicalised into mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the radicalalization process, one noticed that it starts online. as a first person, the person of their church is cut, even by their family, so that the person believes that the patient is the true Muslims, and anyone who despises their behavior and their ideology is a traitor, or by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we need to keep the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming to Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS is justified its brutality with the Quran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as Muslims, as a Mother, as a man, I think we must do everything to stop a group as the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would add to your imagination, when you acknowledge them as representatives of 1,6 billion believers."</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has to do so much with Islam just like the Ku club club with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups are claiming their ideology to their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if you throws a look at it, it is not what they do in their" "Holy Scriptures". ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">"a girl came to him, because she had promised to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said, the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy with which she talked, brought her to silence, and said her, her wrath, her sense of the injustice in the world, they would only bring it into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"nothing inspired by anything and something that had given their anger mind, it was a main target for the instrumentalization by extremists that you spoke a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam established the connection with God and her community.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of protecting them for their anger, he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, kept her to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight as the Islamophobia me and my family concerns.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour consumption of fear affects our democracy every day, on our thoughts of thoughts?"</seg>
<seg id="358">"one study -- actually show several neuroscientific studies -- when we fear, pass at least three things."</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authorized government system, conformance and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study reveals: if you submit testing news, in which negative about Muslims reports, they voted more military attack on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the Rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just a academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"when you look at when the mood against Muslims follow the above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two choices periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"thus, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to a Muslim terror as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling with Muslims is an early warning.</seg>
<seg id="367">We might feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear hurts us all.</seg>

<seg id="381">"we had it and for us it was not an easy decision, for it was about what America would leave to our children: one that would be able to control us through fear, or one where we can exercise our religion freely."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat, we went well with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, drew my shoes off, went into prayer shalle, and what I saw, let me hold."</seg>

<seg id="407">"what started as a platform for crafting began, is in short before, a billion business."</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. possible this is made in research institutions worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air saving" "setting up in our social consciousness, has built a autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France live a six meter high tower of 1 500 bricks. a few years ago, they started to fly with soap."</seg>
<seg id="410">By embossing flying appliances high speed and acceleration in the narrowest room.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-resistant structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"you have learned to carry burdens, treat with turmoil and in general responding to nature laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you a few of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to exceed the limits of the Possible flight in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"thus, a system autonom works, it must know collar where in the room the mobile objects are."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamical Tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, an offsprings of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each air engine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, calculations on board, which should do the machine."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest ece. g B." "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called Heckstarter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">"a plane, which tries to beat two flies with a flap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in the downward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"unlike most of the starters it can fluctuate, and thus has a great advantage with startup and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">However there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">"a restriction of tailoring is that they are sensitive to turmoil, such as windsurfing."</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the air device doesn't matter how the optimal position can be regained and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often provide basic abstract questions that penetrate at the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">"for instance, such a question would be: what is the smaller number of movable parts for controlled flights?"</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for trying to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter is known as machines with thousand movable parts that join forces to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago they were able to fly remote-controlled air-controlled aircraft that only had two movable parts: a propeller and a rear.</seg>
<seg id="435">Unfortunately we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically easiest way, it was recently invented."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flap, hinges and Querruder, no further actuator or inspectors, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanical simple, inside the interior live very much, so it can fly stable and move in space overalludly."</seg>
<seg id="440">"however, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear side. to bring it to catch, I have to do it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability to throw it exactly right when I see all of them is small, so I am showing you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monopoinner is an exercise in genügloneliness, this machine is here, the Omnicopy here with his eight propellors, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this flow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is not symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">"therefore, he is ambivalent in his alignment."</seg>
<seg id="446">"thus, he will receive the outstanding capability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction he is rotated or even as he rotating."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers from eight propellens."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some is shown in models, the rest is learned right at flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">See us this.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two-propeller engines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns in clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build them, they act like a high-performance quadruple."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something going wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery, the machine can continue to fly, even if restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that by making a half plane.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic ill heat.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the great number of autonomous, co-ordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We participated in South-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with local technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">"each unit white, where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine is there to practice on Broadway a flying lampshade.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types such as our work lies in the development and the creation of creativity.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures allow it to form so spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>

<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group particularly graceful -- Rai Weiss from MIT, KIP Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech - a huge laser detector to search for gravitational-waves resulting from collized black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most they stopped for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people realized them as crazy Genies, so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades-long development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the Detector LIGO: the Laser Interferometer- gravitational-gravitational Observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"during the next time the precision of LIGO could be increased considerably, resulting in gaining performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, LIGO was started to clear some smaller, stubborn issues."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, consuming the gravitational-waves of the two colliant black holes through the earth."</seg>

<seg id="492">"all that which I had worked, is no longer Science Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist from black holes and their through observatories like LIGO measurable signals. what are gravitational-waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crow in the texture of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"on the transiting the wave, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for understanding, faculty in courses for relativeptic theory often lead to a correct dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, each of us was stretched on the waves of the waves, and sealed the stretching of an average person was 10 high-21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this is called 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1 Therefore one explained the LIGO staff for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometres long laser detector, and this is absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a thousands of the radius of an atomic kernel. that's grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"description KIP Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs that are hunting for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties when construction such detectors are vast. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are sublime and with the support of the public, certainly all barriers will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to LIGO. Scott claims, LIGO is more than an eye than an eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial excerpts, the size of your mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy. because in this way you can create an image or a map of things by using several points of upcoming light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In pots it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible notes have a wave-length of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things which give you a lot of thing:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child is approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain properties such as key and height, rhythm and volume to close the history behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, speaks straight Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummers Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot produce simple pictures of objects in a space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by watching the waves in the amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least lie for LIGO the common frequencies in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert waveluster in bowls, we can speak the space literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravity to listen, can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes, my colleague Scott has already been busy for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotatable holes, circulates simply: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turn the two body very fast, you hear the same circle with an additional audio change. it sounds like this: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement of movement, shaped into the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date, which at least I have to never forget - heard LIGO:... two black holes with each 30-fold sun mass, which can turn around as fast as the sticks of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the dense body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve a hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent significance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">"LIGO opens up a completely new way to study the Alls, as it was never before possible."</seg>
<seg id="534">On this road we can listen to the space and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space can we see -- practical or basically -- not visible.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a super nova, for example. I would like to know why masculine stars would explode in Supernovae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the space.</seg>
<seg id="538">"but the exciting physical processes happen at the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers from iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through since these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it would be more transparent glass. the Urbang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the Alls, but we will never see it, since the judgment is covered by his own offspring."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitational-waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"most importantly: I am optimistic that we have never seen in all things that we have never seen before, and of which we have no idea of what we can only discover."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, LIGO found equal in the first run things we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that have observed black holes, like LIGO they observed, are the Dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are so called the spricher for our archeological work. "</seg>
<seg id="546">"LIGO allows us to completely different perspectives on the events in space, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we went out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>

<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>

<seg id="575">"almost. I am not perfect, but I feel very much."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, to my children, on our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has a surprising force-effect: only recently, I fully understood that the" "Yes" "was saved to play with my children my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>

<seg id="602">"I tell you so that all of you who work so hard whether you are now a company, a country or a household, making me serious if I say about work, so you understand that I am not only on the computer and fantasizing, and it's true when I say, I understand that it is not going to dream with a dreamjob."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, everything reality, all our blood, everything sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I'm working much, hard and I love it."</seg>

<seg id="608">"thus, one portrays a high tone, liep a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">It feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a sums begins in my head, and it grows and growing, and the buzz is listens to a busy road that I could drive for ever."</seg>

<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong you do it.</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the buzz -- when I started working with television production, when I began to work and make working, build and working together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this buzz. the buzz!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums of action is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzz is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz then you cannot strive for size.</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling not to be different compared to size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I am not for the failure, and I just know that I love the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I will not ask it into question."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make a clear: the more successful I will ever more episodes, the more hibernation, the more work there are, the more things simultaneously, the more observe me, the more I write history, the more expectations."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to succeed, the more you have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country, I managed, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay, the sums, the buzz."</seg>

<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, exaggerated, exaggerated, hidden."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters to the truth are accustomed to the truth that their mother is a single working titles.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" my mom will not be there, but you can write my nanny. "</seg>

<seg id="646">There are the children of a titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are Baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the buzz stopped."</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the motor was framed.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my job not anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, no Reuben, no Reuben, nothing delegate, a Titan sleeps, does not give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a pre-show Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love, which one loves, suddenly eraded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" "Heul you out, blocks from the author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you are doing, you are doing what you do to be a teacher, a painter, Bill Gates, one loves to be a painter, a painter, Bill Gates, and knows how the buzz feels, if the sums stops, who is then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart is listening, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then I imagine my "southern states-waitress."</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way out, late, and she says:" Mama, magst you play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will no say NO to be aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say Yes to all and secondly, she called me not."</seg>
<seg id="675">You call anyone more "cookies."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is that happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I delay it when I am Titan am and my buzz, and here everything changes my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says:" Mama, magst you play? "</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters encounter this, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatic from the book" Everybody Poops "." "</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding, because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and lack of the marches, I can do nothing, except for."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country, which I managed, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists is sticky finger and humid kisses, delicate voices, wax, and the song, in which it leaves slogans, or whatever the girl in" "The kinggin". ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so scarcely that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me does not solve.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy club comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that not immediately, but it happens, it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz comes slowly back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzz but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us remain at the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the buzz, the labour-consumption, the titanium-consumption, that is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"when I ask you who you are, when I tell you who I am when I describe myself using shipments and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is not force and it is non-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real amount is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the current which is of life's lust.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real amount is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real buzz ignored the pressure of history, which did-run tasks, anticipation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but maybe I whispered to God the wrong words because what God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, a lot more love. "</seg>
<seg id="717">"once my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I make this as a rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic of any debt."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I am not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not different to me as they work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is hurting;</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like it to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I always work, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at work as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this confession is painful, because what a man prefer to be considered to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"time honest, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rasen in the garden around, and back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>

<seg id="737">Yet it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe fulfilled me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever heard with playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! tell them too yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you keep me for naïve for a meeting.</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably have right but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a muppet-show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me, until they were magnified that they want something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">"there are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes I will replace a Marienbad or Keks.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and speak my teen-daughter whole 15 minutes long with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more you need not need it."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can set 15 minutes by the piece, even on a bad mood day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes at the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner the kids will bed ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. there must not be the children. it is true to have the buzz to have a place for his soul needs."</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with your own children. it is about joy</seg>
<seg id="759">About the "games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I am not perfect in it. I shy and I victories. friends meet, books read, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" "just for everything I have given up, when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training, when I wanted to meet myself more and more."</seg>
<seg id="765">15 Minutes a piece why not full 15 minutes indulge?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can it be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the sums seems to return then if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens up and I find myself again in my office. I hear a well-known melody, it fills me and my soul. I listen to new ideas. I use it to a full swing and I love my work again."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the buzz, but I do not love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzz, the buzz is not me... no more. "</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap fade and sticky fingers, dinner with friends. "</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my buzz.</seg>
<seg id="775">The amount of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The amount of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the amount of labour is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it is me snap that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and for more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my campfire still burn.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the more happier, I and my children."</seg>

<seg id="786">"the more I feel this sums, the more this unusual, beaming, naked and new feeling of living in me wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am author, I think about things, I awake you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"that belongs to the job, which means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dreamjob should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"yes" "yes" "said to less work and for more games."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurologist.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke or after an automobile accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, as opposed to other bodily organs, a very low ability to self healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe violation of the central nervous system, people often have a permanent, heavy disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I have got functional neurosurgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a Functional neurologist?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"surely they have heard of one of the most famous, the" underground stimulation. "in doing so, one can influence an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function has improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson who suffered severe trembling and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">"I would like to show you, that we are very close to it."</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">"at the time, I was leading waitist and worked the day and night in the staff."</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I catered patients with skull-deer-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They need to imagine that at skull-Hirn-traumata the brain crashed and the skull-pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, you have to diminish the cranial pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">"therefore, you sometimes have to remove a part of brazed brain."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing the brazed brain mass, we decided to analyze the brain with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to leave cells from a tissue, is comparable with very small children that are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the proper diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to thrive them."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it managed by Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This was what he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">It was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unmature cells. "</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you still know from the biotology, that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has tribal cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small nischen of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells stopped differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a couple of weeks they were even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, weird cell population that saw like stem cells but stopped differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">It is from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells hot doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You make 4% of our large-minerinse cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they ensure the hitting of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they staying for us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe they take part in the healing of the brain, as we find it in higher concentrations near brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">"however, one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">"we are facing a potential cell source, which allows brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">This we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">"so, we decided to develop an experiment."</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to take a piece of brain mass of the non-linguistic area, and then the cells want to cultivate the exact same way as Jean-François did."</seg>
<seg id="853">And they can then highlight them in the brain to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we reimplanted them at the deserts of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autonomous transplant -- autootransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we pass these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimplanted the same cells in digging brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they will not go there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario we have an injury to, and reimplanted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained behind them -- they grew up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"proof that they show are these small points. these are the cells, which we flowed in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a fantasy?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual function task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take the pellets by one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"as they had achieved a stable skill level, the last we had in the motorized Cortex the Handmotoric area."</seg>
<seg id="869">"as a result, the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hand anymore."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in people, they recovered spontaneously to some degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastificated brain mechanisms. they are recuperate to some degree just as they did in the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure the monkey has reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left side they see the monkey, which arose spontaneously."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can furnish about 40% to 50% of its initial performance from before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not that precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now you see, when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the plantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can make them freezing and later use.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathology models, for example at Parkinson."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in man.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I am sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" I know someone who need it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I will definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question of what the greatest obstacles are before they can start clinical trials at the people."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms, in order to run these kinds of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start of clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes to get to the hospital, and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical study."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to allow the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply this to a multi-centric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">One has to really suggest that it is useful before you can offer this treatment every one.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course. "</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it."</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as natural.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality, but as inventories of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchanging opponents.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great replica in Beijing have undoubtedly proven that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"indeed, democracy comes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup -- our choices -- not to influence austerity, which have been realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my dear friends who would be repeated if they would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"please, together with me, to believe again to believe Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a truthful and defective democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies will be merged, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction, which is currently threatened by our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">"I call it the" "twins" "paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and know him as the Schuldenberg, who casts its long shadow over the U.S., Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognise the Schuldenberg,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize their senses.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, that belongs to billed savers and corporations, however, to invest there where it would be productive and income could be put together with which one needed humanity's debt and also to produce all the things that humanity urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and the euro zone, 3.4 Billions US dollars to invest in all the wealth produced, such as industrial buildings, schools, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 Billions US dollar sounds like much money, until one compares up to the 5,1 trillion US dollars, which were up at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did except the stock exchange and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and unproductive capital will form the twin-training summit, which are not out of the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result will be stagnating wages, more than a quarter of 25-54-year-old in the US, Japan and Europe, and consequently a low-economic demand that would not invest in which they would not invest. just like Oedipus father, who would not invest it, that his son would kill him if he will grow,"</seg>
<seg id="925">"unmeant the circumstances bring about, that led him kill him."</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"its extremely mischiderous Art All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies," green "technologies, which are decisive for saving the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think about. but before we proceed: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">"Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form, in which the Free and the poor as a majority control the government."</seg>
<seg id="931">The athenian democracy ended naturally too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to minate the significance of athenic democracy due to these proportions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision makers at the Athenian democracy was and is that they were the working poor, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive that they gave them the right to political fellow-determination in questions of the state of citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="935">Athenic democracy is not kept for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, the very bright lights, it is also fast hidden."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our liberal democratic democracies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy was concentrated on the free citizens and the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for the ruling class."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy appeared only when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible, and the democratic process has entered into politics, while the economy - thus the world of corporations - a more democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies since the time, at which this separation of politics and economy began, an uninherited struggle between the two, through the economy gradually undermines the policy."</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder why the politicians are no longer like this?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not up to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because that today in the government can be in the government, and still not in power because power from politics in the economy is interwoven and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hailing with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is about like a herd of carnivores, which has so sustainable the animals, of which they nourished, decimal number, that they are starred at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is similar to the economy that has spread the politics so far from the self-causing economic crisis. the power of the corporations grows, political goods are devaluated, increasing the economic demand and the managing directors of the corporations are frightened to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful the capitalism the" Demos "[the people] sells out of democracy, the higher the Twin Towers, and the greater the waste of human labour power and of the welfare of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy again and it would be better if the" demos "keep control, aside from the exclusion of slaves, the women and the foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go any sun.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only regain a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new kinds of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing Niedrigwage employees through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as the economy and politics are separate areas, automating the twins are higher, the wastage, and the social conflicts are deeper, as I think -- in countries like China will come."</seg>
<seg id="956">"we must therefore reunite the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and thereby pay attention to the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a disease surveillance hyperautocracy that lets the film" matrix "like a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is therefore not whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements that he has brought forth, will survive."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is dissolved by a dystopia, similar to that of the society in" Star Trek, "in which machines serve the people and humans their energy into the study of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener" Agora, "in long talks the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what bräuer it, how could it look to have this" star Trek "-like utopia instead of the" matrix "" similar dystopia? "</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation I would like to give you, in all the short, some examples call."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies: ask yourself a capital market in which you earn money, while you work and in which your capital follows you from a job to the next, and the company -- no matter where you are currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital comes from capital and dissolve and the concept of wage labor is totally outdated.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies, but they do not work in it, and employees that work there. no exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and expenses, and ultimately not emitting twins."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the area of global political economy, please note that our national currencies would have a free-free exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"continue to imagine that the entire world trade in this currency will be traded -- we call it" the Cosmos "," in units of "cosmos", "and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the merchant of each country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that these funds are invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investments are rar."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that there was no technical means at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially in front of the background of a reunified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world that I describe to you is at the same time liberally, in which it was privileged people prefers, and Marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the cereals of history, and keynesians, globally keynesians."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we fail in a "matrix" - similar to ystroscopy?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how to work together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we are doing it better democratically."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... we do not, the technological development will produce a massive decline of the overall economic demand that Larry Summers referred to as" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"through transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next one, as we are currently experiencing it, it will not only destabilize our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberally democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"as well as Hayek, so I am a libertary Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am also fully wirr."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are at ease too."</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you do not get wirr you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical statement -- YV: actually, it was Einstein that said it. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday during the dinner of the speakers, you have said very clearly what you hold from the sight of the West on China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the semblance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy on politics during the area where most of them play, -- the area of the economy -- a completely non-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in certain ways, if I may say this provocative, China today resembles the Great Britain of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- Please remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberale, as John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was very skeptical as regards the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can be observed in China now, very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"to do so, China now throw what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as a finance minister of Greece in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I exhorted that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to start with the eurozone a new beginning,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely, we say goodbye to the self-sufficiency, and the perpetual denial means that a massive sealing of the eurozone ran through the eurozone and continues to be massively threatened with the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity to open on the Greek proposal - by the way, the first suggestion that denial was revealing to this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"it was correct to do. unfortunately, the powers have chosen within the euro zone, within the European group, continues to pay the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">"but, you know what comes."</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to obtain an economic system that is not vital through political will and authoritarianism in life, you might be able to delay a while, but when then the change occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you look ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>

<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister, or any minister there, which claims after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, he did not make mistakes, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake has been to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">"I believed that there was an honest interest on the pages of creditors, to find a common solution."</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they merely wanted to bring our government, just because they didn't want to deal with the inspections, which ran through the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to concede that they have led a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">That is worse than during the "Great Depression".</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the Troika's creditors has imposed us this policy, and a" "this was a colossy mistake."</seg>

<seg id="1038">"Roy Price have never heard most yet, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate-minute minutes of your life on 19th April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for so many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is introductory employed at Amazon Studios;</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production firm of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehogist and describes himself on Twitter as" "films, TV, technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for giving the shows and the content to the Amazon, the Amazon will produce."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can not choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are on the right side of this turn."</seg>
<seg id="1049">"this curve is the evaluation of more than 2,500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows this review."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is rated at nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows how" breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addictive, where, after having seen a season, your brain ask:" "where is there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows shows how" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what happens at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you have a special intelligence to undergo" "Toddlers and Tiaras". ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the middle output, the average television -- the shows that neither good nor bad, they simply do not delight."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is available, and of course it is also the first time Amazon as a little power, therefore Roy wants nothing to risk."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"it requires guaranteed success, so he will hold a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and choosing eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode each of these shows and puts them online where everyone can watch everyone free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon there is anything else out, one gets too, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers check out these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know they will be observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who will record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"when you record the show, when you start pauses, which parts you can skip or check again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">"they collect millions of data to decide with these data, which show them to produce."</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process these and it results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom over four Republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Do someone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that many of these show can remember because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only a average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this turn is 7,4 and Alpha House has been at 7,5 -- something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about at the same time with another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it but he does something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of holding a competition, he and his team compelled the available data on the Netflix spectators, so reviews that give them the shows, what shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then use this data to find out these small details about the spectators: which shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series of a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," "House of Cards". "Netflix has made a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">It has two very competitive, data sealed. "</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine this many data with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What lies that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic shows somehow that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if one collects millions of data for a decision, which one meets, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics than back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"what you can expect is good TV, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"when data analysis is not working, this is something frightening because we live in a time in which we draw more and more to statistics in order to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"nobody. OK, this is even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-health system is a software company and I hope that nobody will ever get in touch with this software. come in touch with this software you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is here in the United States in prison, and to dismissal, it is probably that the data analysis is used in this company to determine whether an dismissal is made or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of choosing whether a show will be good or bad it will be decided if a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, this can be genuine, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">"this is not always the best results, it is not that a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data."</seg>
<seg id="1098">Also the data sealed can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google is making mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009 Google announced that by data analysis outbreaks of flu, the limb way, they can say -- through data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success did in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked just one year after year, until it is no longer working,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it just does not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the release in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data sealed businesses such as Amazon and Google abuse sometimes something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data flows significantly in decisions of life -- on the workplace, in law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">"so, we would prefer to make sure data are helpful."</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medicine. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"have you ever encountered a complex problem, do you mostly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, you put this problem into its parts, so that you can analyze the parts again; as a second, you put the items again to summarise a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and set it together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help and understand a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to merge the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we possess it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"when there is something where the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again merge again, even if the information is incomplete, to then hit a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of a expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I believe it was Netflix so successful because they have data and understanding where they also go into the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their public what they would otherwise have been capable of. but the decision to take all of these parts again, and make a show like" house of Cards "" which does not stand in the data. "</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant they entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they use the data to control all their decisions, first as they foresee to TV ideas while they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "this is what we say to us."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful them are, data are just a tool and not to forget that, this device is pretty useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there were data, this was the tool for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called 'Magic 8 Ball'. it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no matter you just need to shake the ball in order to get an answer. "most probably" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will start it later with a technology demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have made some decisions taken in my life before I would have to listen to the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you of course know, when you have the data available, you want to replace them by something much more extracted, such as data analysis, in order to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"perhaps the ball is klüger and klüger, and ultimately it is up to us to make decisions if we want something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that, despite the large amount of data still pays off, decisions to meet, an expert in what you are doing, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
