Munich 1856 : four cards which will change your view of the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt where young people are to meet .
&quot; a pit @-@ pit , where now is du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
small @-@ gar@@ den@@ ers manage the one @-@ sided cause of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to day .
it is annoying when maps are not up to date .
&quot; that knows everyone who had already had to rain , because the auto @-@ Nav@@ i was held instead of a revers@@ al road a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria At@@ las@@ es , an offer of Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but current - but it is very reve@@ aling . &quot;
especially when you compar@@ es them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and churches have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Mer@@ cury since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a mak@@ es@@ es@@ try which one is not recognis@@ able as such .
&quot; in the large map of view were presented for cities and communities in more detail maps , so @-@ called ur@@ posi@@ tional sheets . &quot;
these emerged according to the Bay@@ er@@ gen Administration Department between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and ski@@ p the first Ver@@ messung Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ war with Austria .
Napoleon wished an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording Bay@@ erns in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops moved to the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 , it was today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a surface @-@ covered Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Max IV . Joseph drove the project further forward , founded the &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische persecution . &quot;
the ur@@ posi@@ tional sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like to find all others on the Bay@@ er@@ isches Library website .
the comparison of Early / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown up .
one example of this is sub@@ s@@ end@@ ling that appears in the map of 1856 relatively isolated .
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was joined in 21 years after creation of the map , so 1877 , as a Mün@@ ch@@ ner district . &quot;
&quot; today , it is lying in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses sub@@ s@@ end@@ ings focus around 1856 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was named in 1878 to Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the rebellion of the Bav@@ arian farmers against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing but fields - at the first glance : at the Hin@@ o@@ oms a smaller map with do@@ zens of lines and numbers : hand numbered plots from the so @-@ called &quot; judgment &quot; which was derived from the basic tax . &quot;
&quot; small plots currently occupy no longer farmers , but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant in the sun . &quot;
a large green area is characterized north of sub@@ s@@ end@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 Schau@@ platz of the Okto@@ ber@@ wirt , was in fact a meadow - and not concrete form . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the face of the present district A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen is not only read by the name A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , not only the name of the &quot; &quot; Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; or of the high@@ t &quot; &quot; On the ventilation &quot; &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ fel@@ d@@ strasse there was once more pre@@ di@@ fied people with mad@@ ness . &quot;
there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ ch@@ ner district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ch .
&quot; from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard of guer@@ ri@@ dden was brought in connection with the deaths of King Ludwi@@ gs II in connection with the death of King Ludwi@@ gs . &quot;
&quot; he was advanced for his time , and for example the Ank@@ ters of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; he is also prohibited to use the staff to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; first place for 280 patients had first place , later it was extended to 500 places . &quot;
at some point this capacity will no longer be out - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905 .
&quot; since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Lat@@ ik@@ um Munich , is one of the biggest psy@@ chi@@ atri@@ sts in Germany since 2006 . &quot;
&quot; on the area of former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people meet in the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um . &quot;
the Order was established in 1920 and turned him into a youth home with training .
&quot; located west of the T@@ SV München East , east of the 1980s from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children @-@ house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; was established in an architectural approach to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , who was destroyed during the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; the Marien@@ platz was at 1856 as &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the merch@@ ant road was named &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies outlines the city of December 1944 many holes in the city centre .
a great stayed until today - at the Marien@@ hof .
&quot; the German Institute , small business houses and a pit @-@ chapel from the Middle Ages were once born on the Marien@@ hof , where these days work and take place on 5 April 2017 , the sp@@ aten@@ sti@@ ch for the second S @-@ Bahn line . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared to the a@@ erial photograph of today - and fill the hole at the Marien@@ hof . &quot;
civil rights @-@ group publ@@ ishes commen@@ cement for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the national union to promote color @-@ above has issued a warning for colored people that go to Mis@@ sour@@ i &apos;s policy and rac@@ ist attacks by Mis@@ sour@@ i .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the federal state Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , following particular attention , A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ aner demands special attention , since a number of frag@@ rant , rac@@ en@@ based inci@@ dents in the whole state shall occur and here , &quot; says it is in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it difficult to claim Dis@@ cri@@ mination , as well as the enforcement authorities of the state , the dis@@ proportionate effect on minorities , promp@@ ted the group to recover the itinerary , the NA@@ AC@@ P said . &quot;
&quot; they have violations of civil rights , the people happen . &quot;
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin color , they are be@@ aten or killed , &quot; &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ansas City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning issued by the organisation for a state in the USA .
&quot; the group inci@@ dents like rac@@ ist dec@@ eased against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; sin died under fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year , after having lost no gas@@ oline during the journey through the state , and was taken by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i , without a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also pointed out a recent report by Mis@@ sour@@ i office , which is shown that black drivers in the state 75 percent are more common than the White House . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of and their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be willing to bring it or let the relatives know that they are travelling by the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 H@@ ass@@ ver@@ break in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the H@@ ass@@ ver@@ ised reporting programme of the F@@ BI , which is the state in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
&quot; the itinerary is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i Law , which would make it harder to complain a company for living or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ LU ) Travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , published after the States of immigration law had to commit people due to immigration law , resulting in view of the AC@@ ES to the other r@@ attle benefits . &quot;
&quot; travel options are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries , but recently , stakeholders have been used to measure the measure as a response to specific laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
Wei@@ res@@ sing project is elementary
the Wei@@ mar Wei@@ res@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U @-@ German parlam@@ entary Peter White and Kor@@ du@@ la K@@ ovac have created a picture on the spot .
at the justi@@ fication of the family Schwen@@ de@@ mann met representatives of the fisher@@ man CD@@ U village together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members .
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann granted first insights into his farm , in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk , and also many young animals , and also houses in five apartments resort guests . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; black milk &quot; &quot; is for him the altern@@ ate mark@@ eter for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the holiday guests will only come to Regi@@ on@@ ales .
&quot; since he is also called BL@@ H@@ V @-@ Chairman of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach , he described the Wei@@ res@@ aun@@ project as &quot; &quot; spontaneous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can not be profitable in such steep areas . &quot;
&quot; the gr@@ ass@@ area care for a lot of work , much of which can be processed with the engine sense . &quot;
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the el@@ ter@@ istic operation and managed these without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he has no bio@@ operations . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; the Comm@@ une has recognized the meaning of the past@@ ure project , and is pleased with the leader . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euro per hect@@ are , farmers would have to support farmers . &quot;
I hope that so the performance of the areas might be crossed out for quite a while .
&quot; the biggest treasure that we have , are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts on how they continue their operation , &quot; empha@@ sized the mayor . &quot;
farmers are often in criticism due to the promotion
with a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
&quot; the entertainment area is 40 hectares , which may not be forced until at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; from the overall height of 71 500 Euro , half over leader was funded , a quarter carried by the municipality of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmer has had to invest 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometres of consec@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Kor@@ du@@ la K@@ ovac said : &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and farmers . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter Weiss : &quot; &quot; here is the best food produced . &quot;
the landsc@@ ap@@ ing unit ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg makes the state support of wheat .
the goal is the disclosure of the Black Chamber .
prerequisite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR approved p@@ ile .
&quot; in addition , the enclosed area is not conclusi@@ ve ( Hang@@ over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the fisher@@ man Wei@@ res@@ aun@@ project 2018 we currently runs an application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of Zau@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the entertainment area corresponds 35 hectares , the cal@@ ender costs are at more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more sacred ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking the Statue of Liberty .
the safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to att@@ acking the statues .
&quot; the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the destruction of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key @-@ ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp @-@ ré@@ g@@ ime , knew what he did , when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a h@@ it@@ ful dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the proposals of the president to the dr@@ astic immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of jet@@ ties and liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have pun@@ ched him if he had done it .
&quot; but he laid hold of their importance , and especially the meaning that you were attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after completion of the monument , its base was added . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta p@@ aves : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go here on a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that sh@@ ines the world . &quot;
the poem which you relate to later was added later and not part of the original freedom of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is right , right , but as he form@@ ulated yourself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance on the emerging words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your poor , thy poor , and your be@@ k@@ ang@@ ed masses that cra@@ ving after it , free to breathe / the el@@ end waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; miserable waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller &apos;s not engaged in liter@@ ary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural struggle : it is indeed a conflict in the importance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who put themselves in place their words after their death on the base - knew very good that they are a high political action .
the sculpture should show the links between French and American republi@@ can@@ ism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in their poem is the female figure no longer abstr@@ ac@@ tly - she has received a voice .
and she gives himself a very different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ants .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and exactly as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change this long time . &quot;
&quot; the big scre@@ am Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the dec@@ ay for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argu@@ ed that the Statue of Liberty was not guilty , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , that the American flame is moving into the hidden world : &quot; &quot; Lady Liberty is proceeding . &quot;
it is intended to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not intended to shine the way into the United States .
rather unusual is Lim@@ bs here on something engra@@ ved .
the importance of the statue is quite and certainly a matter of the point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus consisted in it to see how they saw by the de@@ pl@@ ating , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips on the Dec@@ ks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refu@@ ge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome they have to hear .
&quot; of course this is not the perspective , the Miller and Tru@@ mp would ever want to recognise . &quot;
&quot; their tor@@ ch is not supposed to shine the way , but the hat@@ red , who is their only source of power . &quot;
WH@@ C 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ gs Scottish members of the UK
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle remembered as only two vill@@ i to the Great Britain &apos;s team .
&quot; the Director @-@ Director of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ heads con@@ cave cont@@ ingent on the World Championship is a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record of Scottish Ath@@ l@@ eten was selected for London 2017 which starts on Friday .
&quot; black believes in Scotland developed a little special &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand and we will continue there until we figure it out , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think there is something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish Ath@@ l@@ ete thinking that it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish Ath@@ l@@ eten are medals @-@ candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - the fight against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected by the crew to the team . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is pretty modest .
&quot; their captain &apos;s speech was amazing , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ ie did quite naturally , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth @-@ silver medal winner , which is compete in their fifth world Championships with the 400 @-@ m @-@ hur@@ ts , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 chic@@ ks are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s greatest number of athletes at the World Championship has been seven who were signed in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; the Mu@@ ir Run@@ ner Mu@@ ir leads on this path , and has placed five British and two European records last year . &quot;
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 metres . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another shot , which one should observe after a great season , which included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle has remembered their first World Championships as the only other so@@ ons in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; on the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team but in some cases also in the medals and in the Fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing to be in this chapter is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour , but knowing that my team mates voted for me and chose me , making it very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I am very proud of all the vill@@ i that belong to the team .
it shows only how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to rise on po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what my speech as a capit@@ alization affects ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation since we have a home world championship .
&quot; it is therefore really important to put on this home support and benefit from it , that we are back at the Olympi@@ ast@@ adi@@ on . &quot;
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will simply be a great atmosphere out there .
block cri@@ tic on Facebook : dis@@ wir@@ ing you not to be a public office if you cannot bear the heat @-@ up of voters
the father of our land knew something from poor press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last until the newspapers suggested him because of all , from the internal policy up to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he sh@@ ou@@ ted with criticism , safe . &quot;
but he has not brought his critics to silence .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led as the sheep to respect . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Maryland to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ ges employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people , and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page . &quot;
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ch@@ ased him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the St@@ ab of the Govern@@ ors left the law@@ suit as fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; &quot; Well , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; this is a republi@@ can@@ ic Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amazing . &quot;
he has the Supreme approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his State and strict compliance with the principles .
he was also very skill@@ fully to use Facebook as a primary instrument to connect with his voters and to debate his ha@@ iry head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the block@@ ade of individuals who are on the side of the Govern@@ ors - the public forum is to be officially designated as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post Defense , Ho@@ ge spokes@@ person Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the acts of the Govern@@ ors and argu@@ ed that the block@@ ade of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ator . &quot;
but it is too simple to use the image of tro@@ ll@@ es or sp@@ as@@ ps or h@@ asser@@ ted folks that vibr@@ ate online the wh@@ ip @-@ schw@@ ingen .
the post spoke to some of the real people who have been blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; these are just real people who speak with their chosen guides , a teacher , a ent@@ repr@@ en@@ eur and a pastor , no tro@@ lls . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respectful , thought@@ ful and not prof@@ ited . &quot;
the pastor quoted the Bible in his post and app@@ el@@ ded to the Gre@@ gans of the Catholic faith .
&quot; attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ as , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ ted , but she asked to break down . &quot;
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to H@@ ass@@ ad@@ breaking and other current news , she wrote in the commentary box of the post @-@ direction &quot; The Post &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people are standing on the same subject , then they are ab@@ used by some more than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; as the employee of the Gover@@ nor as &quot; &quot; focused spam attack &quot; &quot; would probably be called &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critics or deleted a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in former times when you had done the same , that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical lad@@ ders and to burn or bring prot@@ esters and to silence . &quot;
but that is exactly what happens digital .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official that he criti@@ ci@@ ates Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is used by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was the last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County captured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District rec@@ ti@@ fier James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they have a voters from their Facebook page . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky received Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also a visit from the AC@@ ES because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable POR@@ TOS had a similar effect on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter to his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had an anonymous tro@@ lls .
&quot; people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ me like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; , &quot; all letters to newspapers , Washington &apos;s decisions made down . &quot;
&quot; petition , who criti@@ ci@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Britain , be overwhel@@ med , according to the historical documents made by the online pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he has not brought them to silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and discourse belong to the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raf@@ fer@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raf@@ fer@@ ty will be able to hope for the next three days on domestic comfort since the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an took place on 25 issue of the Scottish Senior Open .
&quot; Nor@@ di@@ re , who conducted last year at the Ar@@ cher@@ field links to En@@ dr@@ unde , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , has been associated with the new Austr@@ ag@@ ination and acts as a tournament botanical in the name of the association and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reaches its glory with this event , &quot; said Raf@@ fer@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best , he is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry made a great job as he set this place .
he is a di@@ fri@@ ction of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the British E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won his 32 @-@ year career at the European tour as well as at the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels particularly important , &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I have not able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open , as it was in the year after I had won them out of the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories coming from last year will come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
Gary Or@@ r who returned to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year .
this event will be the first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ de@@ en Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I am glad about how it has gone .
&quot; with the trio on the field the former Masters @-@ winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Bro@@ adh@@ ur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six r@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; entrance is free , the car park costs £ 5 per car with one in@@ mates and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less pul@@ mon@@ ary st@@ aves due to passive smoke
over the past two decades less people have died due to passive lung cancer .
at this result scientists are coming to the university hospital c@@ um Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ ke ) in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates obtained per year 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary diseases in Passi@@ v@@ rau@@ lt , &quot; said Sk@@ ating Hei@@ ko B@@ echer . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he moved from 1994 to this issue of 1994 . &quot;
at that time there have been even 400 lung cancer @-@ sto@@ oping due to passive smoking per year in Germany .

pets prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Street are in full swing and lies somewhat less in time , &quot; says the head of the Bau@@ haus Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house@@ keeping , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground much for@@ g@@ ent , which is not noticed in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which constantly hin@@ ders the construction works , represents a big problem for the buil@@ du@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ anz of the motor@@ ists in front of red lights and deport@@ ees is already huge , &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the street is locked and only the bus buses are open to the passage .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been busy with work on the bridge for weeks . &quot;

poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian gold land
when Bar@@ dina de@@ ei dinner coo@@ ks it uses no stove .
it even uses rarely a pot .
&quot; in their wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ulations in the un@@ quiet in@@ don@@ esian province Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually refers to a sweet potato - locally than &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;

&quot; of course , late to work can be dangerous : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink hard , and there are the soldiers . &quot;
&quot; nobody we@@ aved it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ land of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 El@@ ders should vote against the occupation forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which declined to the independence of the Dutch rule , turned quickly against the Government of Jak@@ arta that holds the control over the region and ex@@ cludes foreign journalists or legal observations . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , whereby the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea became the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning tour with the car .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is composed of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bamboo , and out of cor@@ rug@@ ated subjects , transformed by r@@ ust in various yellow @-@ brown t@@ ints . &quot;
&quot; very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , because journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived the Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans had a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says Deg@@ ei and points on their lively , hand @-@ animated tur@@ ban , you dar@@ ker shirts and their bright rock . &quot;
&quot; before , we only had leaves to our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indon@@ esian province where 28 % of men live under the poverty line and some of the worst inf@@ ant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a scenic provincial capital in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has been reduced to 3,@@ 1 billion US dollars in gold and copper alone . &quot;
Pap@@ ua has built over wood resources valued at estimated 78 billion US dollars .
&quot; these rich@@ es are however a source of misery for the pap@@ ua , who make sure that Indon@@ esian army retained a miserable presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort organiz@@ es local military @-@ related units and units between 1998 and 2004 nearly 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pope &apos;s demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden go@@ ose and will be treated mer@@ c@@ il@@ ess .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 papers have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed since 1969 by the Indon@@ esian Military . &quot;
mass@@ ages in Pap@@ u@@ as tri@@ bal defence in the 1970 @-@ 1990s came to in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission to Com@@ mit Gen@@ o@@ cide .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police used more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the past year . &quot;
&quot; we Wer@@ den Every@@ thing &quot; says it in a report by the arch@@ dioc@@ ese Brisbane from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ law@@ ful execution and torture - rape and electro@@ stra@@ ws are particularly popular with another report - and the brutal decline of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as any week happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researchers for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws are reinforced since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;

&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local pap@@ ua , &quot; &quot; says A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ One @-@ local , who moved to the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
it has the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the Women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market costs .
&quot; the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the crowd and as Jo@@ kow@@ i , spoke during his election campaign , to address the ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
the former car@@ penter 27 of the total 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; our hearts are broken , because we voted in 2014 for Jo@@ kow@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that the justice is restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jo@@ kow@@ y inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indon@@ esian soldiers on a motorcycle by the darkness . &quot;
the ro@@ cking children told them that they should switch their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took a cl@@ ash to her tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers , who had drunk , j@@ ailed , and sm@@ ote the group with their ro@@ bes , told victims and witnesses . &quot;
then he mo@@ ist one of the soldiers into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard pressed that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government Commission was set in fire and the things escal@@ ating the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves on a football field in front of the local police station and the military com@@ mander @-@ centre to demand justice . &quot;
they carried out cerem@@ onial hunting ar@@ ches and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ dance - in the circle constantly and a bird @-@ pro@@ ving - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago trunk .
some prot@@ esters began to lean stones at police and military post .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers was sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses will afford more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of T@@ IME who has not been released in local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ oto K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ pping danger , and called for peace and called the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening in the mood to listen .
&quot; when I turned myself , I was suddenly shot into my lin@@ kes wr@@ ist , &quot; he said T@@ IME for the veranda of his colorful , painted wooden building . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame knows still not who has folded , but says that the ball came from the rows of the soldiers gathered soldiers . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was taken three times , so his cous@@ in , the witness of the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and sought his body to make sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who carries out only one name , the T@@ IME in a dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I have k@@ issed him .
&quot; the chief editor of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , re@@ por@@ ters that his officers &quot; want their Station only &quot; secure &quot; because they will be attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten us to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed , and many others have been in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
the news about the k@@ ill@@ ings arrived only on the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks , Jo@@ kow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he vo@@ iced sympath@@ ies for families of the victims and to address the historical ab@@ norm@@ alities of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want that this case is immediately resolved right now , so in the future it will no longer happen &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Bio@@ sm@@ in@@ ister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he entered an extr@@ ater@@ ally mechanism for the formation of historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the emig@@ ration began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injury are occurred long ago . &quot;
some were in the 90 @-@ ren and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ year .
&quot; the point is that we have committed to address these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then we made a retreat when he spoke at Jak@@ arta on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with T@@ IME , and said , he has no plans to set up a complaint mechanism . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; action dedicated to the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; , &quot; said the more than 1,000 deaths in Ost@@ tim@@ ors of the bloody Independent Declaration of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua has already been attached , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were contrary to such claims with gri@@ mm@@ ed un@@ believers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear later .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have afraid to be arrested by the military , have afraid to become shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us reiter@@ ated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was be@@ aten from the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the body , the military sought after me , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
the sh@@ ot@@ ries have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a bass player , who refused to bring a unconscious man to hospital , a person and 17 others have been in@@ ju@@ red , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ wned when he caught in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital . &quot;
asc@@ ended vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company office of the company .
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers were stones on officers , who re@@ acted to it by warning of warning . &quot;
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian police ) began to shoot the crowd and killed a killing .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that it will be reven@@ ge , &quot; &quot; says the 29 year @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Badi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witness , as the last one was delivered here quickly , so the T@@ IME . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden me two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called to hold the involved officers on account and pull the mobile Brig@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ rest for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of sensu@@ al development strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction of the members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green highlands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) to defend the re@@ bel army , which claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by killing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ apping of Indon@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders have come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us yoga and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai , thousands of people have been arrested and arbitr@@ ary in cust@@ ody , under the pre@@ text of the &quot; securing of national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some will never dive again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the bit of rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as far range .
people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potato .
&quot; they reserve most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot;
ten pieces of emergen@@ cies only 10,000 in@@ don@@ esian R@@ up@@ ies ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
&quot; during the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown since the opening of new routes to the airport Nab@@ ire in larger numbers have arrived . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs that exist in the region , go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants . &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to lead their own business competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Chief Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions of the coverage of international media remain tense . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to the movies . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the dep@@ uty Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jo@@ kow@@ is Com@@ pletion , the restrictions of reporting will be up@@ set to foster transparency and development , not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indon@@ esian un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and Western pap@@ ua , to report : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbors pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March six Pacific States - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ine Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ onen Islands - to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian State Department of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r pointed the alleg@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta , &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to conc@@ eive the evidence for human rights violations . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take this notice .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , held under the direction of the human right @-@ amb@@ assador K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May attended , bra@@ ins their silence and be@@ ang@@ ed him &quot; We want freedom &quot; , according to a source that also participate in meeting , but anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua said that they are probably not right again for Jo@@ kow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jo@@ kow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ kis@@ ses , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the Chief Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants to know that Jo@@ kow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people live , apart from that it is under the constant threat of a common military , is in im@@ pover@@ ishment and health services . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , their voice for Jo@@ kow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; that he must pay . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ les led a recent symbolic act of apost@@ asy : the body of an opposition was buried on a terrain just opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they might never come to justice , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with ges@@ en@@ kt@@ on head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scrapers of Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants , from the 3@@ 37 meter high , 79 @-@ stor@@ ey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that is placed in just two years by the sky@@ scr@@ aper , which is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evac@@ u@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we went up with fire alarm and when writing people . &quot;
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50@@ th floor to bottom , &quot; &quot; told a resident who took his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 0@@ 0.00 PM GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building were cooler . &quot;
&quot; the government said , they work on the provision of accommodations for those affected . &quot;
&quot; the incident can be used for the safety of materials , used in outer areas of sky@@ scrapers around the world . &quot;
&quot; investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch @-@ Building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest portion of the damage caused by the fair@@ ing , the outdoor clothes for decoration or insulation . &quot;
&quot; in the UK , the police , she believe that the system of plates to isol@@ ate the isolation and fair@@ ing in the London Gren@@ fell @-@ Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a Bran@@ ger in June , with which approximately 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through the General Meeting Cup with its big Davis Cup Cou@@ p .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho @-@ Chi @-@ Min@@ h City , the support for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single was only supported on two winn@@ ings , grasp do not support the necessary two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; although it is often very long , but even so much appreciated Five @-@ sentence classics will remain in the tradition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , was therefore only scar@@ cely missing . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our membership fees have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the job .
&quot; at all , not only for the vote before the proposal before , the finals had already come to a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; from 2018 there are only compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be posted in the first round in the first round , the hosts . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the costs of the organizer , the requirements for training rates , etc . , and players will be able to complete the Davis Cup lower official media dates before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 U.S. travel@@ er brings together to the aircraft , find out a survey
&quot; a survey among passengers revealed that more than 20 percent become conscious or un@@ aware of items to the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration by sm@@ ug@@ gling , among them at least 6 percent , which mar@@ vel the plane while they acci@@ dentally for@@ b@@ ted kni@@ ves or other objects with blade . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent asser@@ ted that they could have been late , that they have traveled with fire@@ arms , am@@ muni@@ tion or explo@@ si@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; the survey on more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a Jet @-@ charter service , the STR@@ ATOS Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , carried out - also proved that younger travellers are ab@@ used for the rules . &quot;
&quot; by asking the en@@ quired , that they wis@@ ely tried to fly with something that was prohibited from T@@ SA , were 19,@@ 7 percent Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were . &quot;
&quot; the most common items that were squ@@ ander@@ ed by T@@ SA agents , were foods and liqui@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 percent gave to know wis@@ ely items with clin@@ ches carried by the security control , while 2.4 per cent of female respon@@ dents and 3,@@ 7 percent of male respon@@ dents , they confirmed that they could easily have put drugs into the airplane . &quot;
&quot; the company said , I asked travelers in the whole country to find out how many acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ gel@@ ware would have taken through the airport security and how many it could have done . &quot;
&quot; it is not a surprise that men , the most sm@@ ug@@ gling ware - wis@@ ely or un@@ wis@@ ely - due to security , those were most frequently flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often uns@@ ure which flu@@ ids they are allowed to take them or how much of it .
&quot; so , there is no surprise that the biggest quantity of the T@@ SA stored objects in bot@@ any liqui@@ ds . &quot;
for a while the guys thought the T@@ SA could see books as sm@@ ug@@ gling ware .
&quot; liqui@@ ds are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la &apos;s order
&quot; elec@@ tro @-@ thous@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is available with the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; model 3 . &quot; &quot;
so far he has under@@ scored that some of the customers had with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
&quot; in addition to the ever tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ant numbers on sales and even gigantic distribut@@ ing , Tes@@ la leader El@@ on Mus@@ k has betra@@ yed for the first time a different , lesser @-@ packed number : the cancell@@ ations in the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in the past few months Mus@@ k was often applied with the more than 500,000 pre@@ orders for the new car , whose delivery begins . &quot;
&quot; now , Mus@@ k is a : of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders the 63.@@ 000 has already been with@@ drawn . &quot;
critics always pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; during a cancellation pays Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 Po@@ unds ) &quot; &quot; reservation &quot; &quot; reservation . &quot;
&quot; currently , 45@@ 5.000 such un@@ binding reservations are provided , spatial Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with an@@ al@@ ysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could be applied to the problem , the Tes@@ la boss believes not . &quot;
its argument : the challenge for ambitious growth goals does not lie in demand but on the production side .
last year Tes@@ la 8@@ 2.000 vehicles delivered .
&quot; in 2018 it should be put together - 50@@ 0.000 , 2020 for a million . &quot;
the demand for this is evident .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , currently per day 1800 reservations are included . &quot;
&quot; who orders today a &quot; Model 3 &quot; , &quot; is allowed to reck@@ on in the second half of 2018 by delivery - if Tes@@ la creates it , its brand @-@ new , has never been tested in practice with maximum assistance with maximum utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , it comes to larger delays , then the non @-@ binding obligation of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company cannot prevent un@@ satisfied customers in dro@@ pping . &quot;
EPA &apos;s leader P@@ ru@@ itt moves to reducing the rules of Obama &apos;s regulations for reducing emissions
&quot; a day after being covered by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the boss of the environmental protection authorities , his former decision , to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions from smo@@ g @-@ related air conditioning . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , as its agency proved to pay attention to the needs of state environmental authorities in response to more rapid than previous vulner@@ ability . &quot;
he did not mentioned the law@@ suit was raised against his previous job in a Federal Court of occupation .
&quot; it is a deadline , which ran on 1 October for states to adhere to the standards of 2015 for the bot@@ tom@@ ed o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt said in June , that he will delay in order to give a year more time to study the plan and to avoid taking in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was appointed to O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma prior to its appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was long time a reliable opponent of younger environmental protection rules . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly repe@@ ating or hes@@ it@@ ating regul@@ ating the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden conversion of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the agreement of regulatory escal@@ ation agenda .
&quot; last month a federal Court of Washington has decided that the EPA has exceeded its authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas enterprises to monitor and reduce meth@@ an@@ lec@@ ks to delay . &quot;
&quot; in an on Wednesday evening opinion , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that its turn@@ around at Oz@@ on@@ standards are simply the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under former administr@@ ations , the EPA has often accepted the deadlines for carrying out and then waited for the appointment of established activists and other countries , and said in an agreement to carry out the date for carrying out the EPA , the EPA said more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by jurisdiction , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
we also accept the law and authority that gives us serious .
&quot; nevertheless , the EPA &apos;s statement , that P@@ ru@@ b will eventually use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available full authority &quot; to ensure that the provisions are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in the Congress will push for a more comprehensive re @-@ capture of the oz@@ on@@ ment .
&quot; in the last month , legislative acts should delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 at least eight years . &quot;
the measure was not yet made to the vote in the Senate .
&quot; the New Yorker &apos;s general state @-@ General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who created the coalition of the states that re@@ comp@@ elled the EPA in this week , said the Group intends to maintain the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; revers@@ ing of EPA - after our mo@@ unts - is an important win for the health and safety of these 6.5 million new Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g , who flows into their communities , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in this case , in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Io@@ wa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; soil Oz@@ on arises when poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refined , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere responding to sunlight . &quot;
&quot; the smo@@ g smo@@ g can cause serious pain problems for sensitive groups of people , and will contribute every year to thousands of premature death cases . &quot;
representatives of the public health system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ ding course change .
&quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step by the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e &quot; , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp &apos;s government to engage in environmental poll@@ uting and their particular interests . &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celeb@@ rates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 Years St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche is invited to the old cemetery @-@ area in tum@@ ours on Sunday , 16 . July , at 16.@@ 30h to a Seren@@ ade . &quot;

&quot; the visitors to the sixth &quot; &quot; Advent@@ s@@ Seren@@ ade &quot; &quot; can be ench@@ anted by this powerful place . &quot;
the rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors tum@@ our to their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini stressed : &quot; it is a unique villages . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in Wür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg@@ ische Ur@@ g@@ book : Count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the gr@@ ati@@ ble church at Tum@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the wording of the certificate on the Tum@@ linger Berg , there was also a splendid farm to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age was right and not the other way around . &quot;
so there were people there .
&quot; from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today is still in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the splendid sett@@ ler of the village . &quot;
old maps from time around the year 1600 under@@ pin the historical circumstances .
the pat@@ ron@@ ym was born in the early medieval village .
&quot; a Lord , who built a church , for equipment , and with a pastor , continued to keep the owner of this church and could also be dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot;
associated with it the right to put a pastor or to set up a pastor of a new pastor .
three alt@@ ars were in the church and two bells in the tower .
the biggest of the two zer@@ b@@ n at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bells ring then took place in 16@@ 92 , but later was released in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window plates were introduced and the bells parts were stolen .
the roof was in@@ dense .
17@@ 96 lag@@ ged French troops near the church .
they brown out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church of dro@@ h@@ ten 18@@ 09 to fall .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from listening skills .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ary Church broke off .
only the church tower is allowed to stand .
in the New Year @-@ eight 18@@ 34 sp@@ alt@@ ed a storm the church tower and half rus@@ hed .
&quot; in order to avoid a disaster , the tower was interrupted . &quot;
only the still existing tur@@ mo@@ g stayed as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ ass@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em maintain by the &quot; &quot; sheep &quot; &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn , the Hil@@ arius system . &quot;
&quot; the organizer invite friends and sponsors tumor on Sunday , July 16 , the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;

the Seren@@ ade is only place with dri@@ zz@@ ling weather .
&quot; the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters in the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius grounds , which is of importance for tum@@ ours and listening of listening . &quot;

association wants to check the approval of Win@@ dr@@ yers
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim wo@@ ke themselves &quot; &quot; does not see a legal condition for the construction and thus turned into the land of the country . &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim wo@@ ke themselves &quot; has been encouraged Andreas Co@@ ve ( CD@@ U ) to make his approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ man N@@ ette .
it is un@@ law@@ ful .
&quot; the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Bo@@ ish@@ ed@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , since the time in Vier@@ sen only exists on the border @-@ border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration of concentration , construction and operation of wind turbines are fundamentally possible , at the same time causes the concentration of concentration and a exclusion of wind energy for the remaining city area . &quot;
&quot; such zones are to prevent a &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot;
&quot; four days before , the city of Vier@@ sen had seen a second wind power consumption zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but the district government was not approved , because of a Form@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning a legal condition , the authorized authorization is still un@@ law@@ ful and therefore also with@@ ered , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current status of things : the city council entered again before the summer break , once again the wind@@ centr@@ ation zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ul@@ mer N@@ ette decided ; a approval of the district government stands still . &quot;
&quot; S@@ kens : &quot; &quot; to this point , the issu@@ ing of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines were excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been received by the district of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; explained a spokes@@ person . &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to check the matter again .
they are likely not likely to do that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; with regard to ongoing procedures at the administrative Court , the circle of Thursday wanted no content on Thursday to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , an affiliate of NEW , is planning to build a surface of four @-@ 200 meters high winds . &quot;
&quot; already last year the company , at which the town of Vier@@ sen is involved , p@@ inning @-@ agreements with the owner of about 65 hectares of great money . &quot;
with establishment of the four wind turbines the electricity needs to be covered by approximately 11 400 households - this is equivalent to approximately one @-@ fifth of the electricity demand of all four households .
the NEW re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vi@@ ers@@ ens City appeared green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbines in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor cr@@ aps together : woman dies in horrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday afternoon at 10 am on the L 333 between Nieder@@ s@@ men@@ ach and B@@ bird ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman has been fatal .
two more people were easily in@@ ju@@ red .
the national road stayed over hours locked .
&quot; according to police statements , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman held out of Bor@@ ni@@ ch with their cars within the frame of the accompanied driving with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as an esc@@ ort the L 333 towards B@@ bird . &quot;
city and dealers plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bad Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ er and people from the region should re@@ discover the shopping area in the city centre in September .
&quot; the Commercial Society and the Municip@@ al Auth@@ orities do not want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 , to enti@@ ce the inhabitants of the shopping @-@ stroll into the city center . &quot;
&quot; as the chairman of the profession , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ ank &quot; weekend to raise the customers for this purpose , which offers the own city away from the usual supermarket . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a market with regional suppliers are planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , indigenous companies are to present themselves with their figur@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city center are to be inviting . &quot;
&quot; here , the action is not only on the inhabitants of the city and the surrounding region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bag , point out to the ac@@ tions @-@ weekend , so Christian king . &quot;
municipal authorities and trad@@ es@@ persons cooperate with the industrial and Chamber of Commerce .
&quot; thus , the business association and the city enters into another stage of the project &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive city centre &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include new offers like the first &quot; &quot; Ak@@ tiv @-@ Day &quot; &quot; as well as the first &quot; &quot; Ak@@ tiv @-@ Day &quot; &quot; and sell @-@ off Sunday , talks with all the trad@@ es@@ men and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the rest on parking fees on that day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potenti@@ als are also to be opened again or again . &quot;
this includes spa guests and tourists .
&quot; however , many natives have lost the city downtown shopping from sight . &quot;
&quot; in the end , all of that would help to in@@ vigor@@ ate the city center - to the owners , the companies throughout the city and associations . &quot;
&quot; managed to overcome the Le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that took part , had king in spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , leader of the I@@ HK Centre in Müh@@ l@@ hausen shared with that in the nation@@ wide third &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ afts &quot; Day , for the first time , five Thur@@ ingi@@ an cities . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za this is Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ light @-@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day sol@@ ves &quot; to promote the esteem of local trading and make its importance to the common good of our cities stronger , &quot; &quot; says . &quot;
the operation of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners can also make clear that every citizen can affect its purchase behaviour itself .
two deaths and several wounded after explosion at US school
&quot; during construction work , it came to a gas of gas in the school building . &quot;
new people have been in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; in the U.S. city of Minneapolis , two people were killed and nine others have been wounded , some of them were difficult . &quot;
according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade the fire bri@@ g@@ ade was still a last in critic@@ ised state .
a man died as part of a school building at the explosion @-@ ring .
a first missed first later was also dead @-@ born .
&quot; with the dead , it was a staff of the school . &quot;
&quot; as a un@@ fortunate , the authorities suspected work on a gas line . &quot;

Tru@@ mp set out after vers@@ ed tran@@ scription by phone call Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription by phone call between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and Le@@ aders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tru@@ mp called on a phone with the Mexican presidency of En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to to say that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. President seized him , because he had publicly den@@ o@@ unced the wall . according to him , he said to him , &quot; This is what you cannot say in the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States , and s@@ wollen , Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that a trade for the USA refugees trying to mig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; &quot; m@@ ies &quot; &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ ies &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; , &quot; after being proposed a ban to res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp was finished to call Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; that is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ Mass@@ aker : activists conduct rac@@ ist mo@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mer@@ cury was driving through a group of viewers in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ ank on the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white rider I was able to reach the bridge , a group of white men came forth to block his path . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man middle age in a needle @-@ strip @-@ suit - took a long train to its cig@@ ar and looked after the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; brood &quot; &quot; the man . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ l , it from the car ! &quot;
&quot; Schre@@ ie torn as the silence , as a young black man of the passenger is sealed . &quot;
&quot; fortunately this horrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only a position . &quot;
&quot; but if then a loop around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; is thrown , almost all in the audience are very real sig@@ h . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 Ombud@@ sman for the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge returned to im@@ itate the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Murray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 were pun@@ ched . &quot;
no one was ever prosec@@ uted because of the murder .
&quot; it truly is in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - even though we see them in our communities , even though we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps in organizing the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old Congress of Congress of Georgia and a lifetime of civil rights .
&quot; for him , it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the mon@@ ro@@ e community that a wrong never has been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want enforcement , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
a Jur@@ è@@ zin@@ er puts a to@@ wel into the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI acts , which were obtained by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding County were di@@ gest@@ ed in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but no one has ever been charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been on a free foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , he made a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of the black citizens in Georgia for the first time , at the op@@ tionally fighting in summer their voice . &quot;
&quot; at approximately at the same time as choosing st@@ aining according to information of the black Far@@ mp@@ le Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight down - supposedly because of a woman . &quot;
Bro@@ oks said that the ru@@ mor was in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby she carried away from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com out of prison , so that F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Murray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when they removed from the prison , and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge closer , Lyn@@ mo@@ mo@@ b surrounded by car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison , which has been prepared and arranged , including a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a complex between state and local enforcement purposes , which was not only involved in the morality , evidence , and the identity of witnesses has changed . &quot;
Bro@@ oks does not formulated it yet .
&quot; it was a electoral mass@@ acre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
nearly a decade ago Cass@@ andra has led the annual retro@@ fitting of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ ch .
&quot; their account is vivid , gri@@ pping and is explained in a kind of profound racism , which many believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to look , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we then are confronted with its gl@@ iness in all of us , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but I cannot build any relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen or listen to what I did .
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest bl@@ acks - into a room and lau@@ ght , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece started . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ved Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the Chief of C@@ lan@@ der gli@@ ders for years , but he said that the role will never become easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I am not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to get this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room , the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the h@@ ester , and pus@@ hes him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- er , mer@@ ging of my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona by the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone will break ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lau@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still k@@ ich@@ ever . &quot;
&quot; I simply don &apos;t think that white people back then &quot; n --- &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but , wit@@ ched one of the other black performers . &quot;
you only need to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; and that is exactly where the energy in the room , a sense of compani@@ onship will replace the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everybody is busy making this right , not just because of the game but also because of the memory of the four comfort@@ ed people . &quot;
the scene begins again .
&quot; this time Ras@@ cona the N @-@ word says , he says it sharp and with pressure . &quot;
absolutely no one is laugh@@ ing .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there is Schre@@ ie , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , with a dream dress dressed , is about the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actor and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays h@@ ull Lob@@ os &quot; &quot; Str@@ ange Fru@@ it &quot; . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it wis@@ ely a group of about four dozen spect@@ ators swe@@ at and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost between black and white .
&quot; a couple is made from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come only down the street . &quot;
&quot; they all experienced almost eight hours of Georgia , if Bro@@ oks is on a pilgrimage to the excav@@ ations of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; up to this point , the Mor@@ de is a an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when one stands on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ ro@@ oft@@ ops found , the air feels p@@ oured . &quot;
&quot; when the final notes of the song will sound , Gre@@ ene invites you to get closer and insp@@ ect the body &apos;s name . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cken on their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ ders a small boy , as he w@@ ool of it . &quot;
after a few minutes I would like to thank Gre@@ ene of the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors take the Lyn@@ ch@@ sei@@ l and w@@ ischen its tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the move who has played the cl@@ an . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ cona by two of his fellow players and then breaks into her arms we@@ eping together ; the emotional load of the performance will eventually break with him .
&quot; it is ok , &quot; whis@@ per@@ ed one of women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience is composed of the actors for dinner .
at a table plau@@ sible a white pair made of Atlanta stimul@@ ated about the last@@ position with a black couple that they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski was therefore fighting words to find words which feelings are left .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you and doing that , because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what that really does with me , lets me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still further , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called the Police @-@ shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks yard stops at his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of the civil rights . &quot;
&quot; he said , he already started to plan the performance over the next year . &quot;
&quot; the im@@ position is inspir@@ ational , because it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have end@@ ure , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; who has not studied his own story , who doesn &apos;t know his own story is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monum@@ ental work is director Frank Cast@@ orf on a b@@ unt fri@@ vol@@ e st@@ aging in front of gigantic cow @-@ stor@@ ey scenery .
&quot; the filming ( designed by Alek@@ sand@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows optional a s@@ hab@@ itable stre@@ et@@ ail and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR &apos;s times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;

later we have to believe Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) .
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with strong appl@@ ause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Di@@ rig@@ ent Jan@@ owski , who is hum@@ ble and crus@@ hed his hands to Merkel &apos;s gl@@ az@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; big appl@@ ause there is for the concert band , which shows for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in leg@@ gy ni@@ gh clothes . &quot;
the performance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ ete@@ am .
&quot; in 2013 he had to leave a gell@@ on @-@ concert in 2013 , there were five years later great rejo@@ icing in which the &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is really looking forward to it .
&quot; one notice that the audience has grown up with the &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; in a certain way , she had said shortly before the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience had not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of his point of view . &quot;
I am a positive reset .

amount : I made Ab@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a building studies , we say succ@@ e@@ eding successfully . &quot;
I knew for me that it is true for me and I want to do something else with people .
and then I asked what you do .
&quot; a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the burning maybe too . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will launch my studies in the winter semester .
I will study dual study ; probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social job education and studying in Ham@@ m at Fach@@ hoch@@ schule .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
&quot; amount : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
probably it comes always on where to make his F@@ S@@ J .
it can make it from aging up to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
at me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me it was just the right thing that has exhausted me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs .
unlike in building degree :
&quot; amount : well clear , here it is not about to be reck@@ oned off . &quot;
one always has other people in mind that each have a completely different story behind .
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager has been fet@@ ched from the family - you always have to respond individually to it . &quot;
very interesting .
and you did not have a cont@@ act@@ ment ?
quantity : for this I am not the guy .
there is a area that gives a much .
much love , a lot of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but so is life . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son abbrevi@@ ated further 3,000 jobs and abbrevi@@ ated the divi@@ dend to revi@@ ve the business &quot;

&quot; in an opinion of Nato , it is said to be the blast on Thursday night whether a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; by persons &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explo@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the statement asser@@ ted that all inter@@ pret@@ ations are in a stable state , and in the U.S. military hospital in the US square Bag@@ ram . &quot;

EPA returns the decision to delay the Smo@@ g @-@ usually after pl@@ edges
&quot; the U.S. American environmental protection authorities have a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama , lifted , what the states are oblig@@ ated to include the Smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 states def@@ endants the agency because of the ped@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late at Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ specifications 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the Agency of the Agency , with states to work together . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and considering that we are responding to our state partners , &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced the intention of EPA in June to set up zone emissions in which part of the country &apos;s poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions must be judged , where inc@@ isions have to be made to delay ti@@ ghter air@@ quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , reached on Tuesday , and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to withdraw a wide range of environmental programmes , which is imposed by the former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda , which should boost Tru@@ mp &apos;s economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , the efforts have triggered the set@@ back of Democrats and reserves , who worry about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the website of EPA says that the inhal@@ ing of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function and can reinforce the breath@@ able symptoms &quot; like as@@ thma . &quot;
municipalities want communal space
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ votes the community of flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ z@@ eln decides to set up a joint venture in future seniors . &quot;
&quot; in front of the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing basic piece was signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades reported . &quot;
&quot; although it &apos;s still going to last until the so far the parish community belong to the parish @-@ property , but there is now no planning for planning for a private investor to st@@ ating project . &quot;
there is a discussion about a joint venture .
&quot; one of the two investors , which are still in the boat , has offered the community to meet . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living area - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters ( at least 70 square meters ) for a special rate . &quot;
&quot; the administration and majority of the community state fails to look forward in such a common area just as the meeting point for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ fair apartment , but open to the congregation . &quot;
&quot; for example , the word of &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ke café &quot; &quot; made the lap . &quot;
&quot; the decision is decided by the provision of funds for the current household already last autumn , by funding opportunities . &quot;
the construction is in the refurb@@ ishment region .
&quot; the establishment of a common period would be reported as reported T@@ j@@ ads , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the decision @-@ going line is to signal the investor that one does not want to throw him in this respect not a cal@@ or@@ le between the legs , the finding that both saddle @-@ height - which reduces the shut@@ down and the construction of economic power - is possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this supplement . &quot;
if it helps : in tune he passes the Panel .
not so easy it goes with the common room .
&quot; Daniela reputation refers to the many of its own buildings , with whom you are not going to be right now , Leh@@ ne is now in the common room from the window , says : &quot; I do not feel hard with it . &quot;
Yvonne Sta@@ iger is definitely speaking to the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
she sees behind it a con@@ spic@@ uous stance on any dispute or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not so , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no grant , but con@@ den@@ sing a true , in the case @-@ case market , is the title . &quot;
&quot; state application , the decision @-@ going for decisions according to the decision , takes place three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; it remains in two counter@@ parts during the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller thus mer@@ ges : &quot; &quot; if we put the decision so , we make a giant step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
coll@@ ision with Car : Rad@@ ler is shining on the road

&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
the last was not good . &quot;
&quot; however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in a performance increase in the first official required of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;

in the Har@@ z of Stern walking
&quot; in the Har@@ z , the nation@@ wide &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ile &quot; &quot; is said . &quot;
this is planning the association Observ@@ atory St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a Plan@@ etary Gui@@ delines in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; coming to the visitor to the needs of many hard@@ ships , was called it . &quot;
&quot; combining nature , science , movement and sporting performance . &quot;
the members want to settle along the planned route and inform on stars and stars .
&quot; in a first phase up to 2018 , the association is planning a well @-@ reaching installations of five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber &quot;
the information on the tablets should be suppl@@ em@@ ented by the internet .
&quot; therefore , the location of a good mobile network has played a role in the sit@@ ing selection . &quot;
also Acces@@ sibility is a crit@@ erion .
later the star@@ base train should be expanded by train .
&quot; on the star@@ base path , the viewer know a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual star , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star stronger than another , although it is much further away . &quot;
&quot; he also conv@@ eys , in which constell@@ ation have a chosen star , and when he is best to see . &quot;
the association has been running in the Berg@@ ü@@ t@@ chen St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 .
&quot; based in the middle of the national park Har@@ z , according to the Federal Ministry of Natural Protection ranks among the six dar@@ k@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
frequently they are from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a @-@ galax@@ y with naked eye clearly visible .
&quot; since 2003 , there has been an initiative of the Planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen on an initiative of the Planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen some simil@@ arities like the planned ast@@ er@@ wer@@ g - the Plan@@ eten@@ weg . &quot;
&quot; starting in front of Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ all@@ ee that forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ eten@@ weg leads up to the Hain@@ berg and observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ emar@@ den ( Community Glei@@ ze ) with the planet S@@ edn@@ a . &quot;
the specimen with the single planet - including the D@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed Pl@@ uto at the end@@ point - are exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ ank so on a sphere of 6,@@ 5 milli@@ meter diameter , while the sun is about 70 cen@@ timet@@ res . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
&quot; while the light of sun is needed until the Pl@@ uto , for about eight hours , we need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Pl@@ uto . &quot;
ped@@ est@@ rians are therefore faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed @-@ star but would last a half year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time to discuss a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a coll@@ isions to ins@@ ing the most thri@@ lling box@@ ing in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the irregular World Box@@ ing Council Light@@ weight champion , the hallway went down to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing Organisation Super @-@ fe@@ ather champion . &quot;
after Gar@@ ci@@ as victory through mon@@ oph@@ onic decision over the former four @-@ divisions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time both fighters are members of the top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; How does it go to you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturdays evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the pair of photos , the Lom@@ ach@@ enko manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as , that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size order &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; remembered Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I am up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to run on light weight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
they demand the fans .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed to .
&quot; box@@ ing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; questions asked if it should be in Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must compete with a 135 pounds @-@ debut in this year to arrange a date in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their lightweight @-@ cover competition in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all fans asked for him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and op@@ ed later openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , he cher@@ ish Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; an enormous fighters &quot; &quot; and he will possibly take part in his Saturday @-@ battle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held in the generous praise for Gar@@ cia , and said that he think the triple champion from River@@ side is very slow , but I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to make the co @-@ Aus . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show head@@ strength , then box@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; both they said , they could sense the Mom@@ entum , which was emerging for their own battle . &quot;
&quot; this is the fight , which must be carried out . &quot;
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work in it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; I was waiting for the top fighters and that is Mi@@ key .
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four Ver@@ last to tire @-@ space
during an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon four people were badly in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; after initial information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost just before the launch of the market in front of junction market wide after a ty@@ re @-@ maker &apos;s control over his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the passenger car sh@@ ud@@ dered to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he struck himself and then stood on the roof of the GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ STRE@@ I@@ ES . &quot;
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - have been severely in@@ ju@@ red during the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the past through the b@@ ail@@ out service , the A7 toward the north for about an hour was locked , then the traffic on the left lane fell by the accident . &quot;
&quot; For@@ tun@@ as Hoff@@ mann : &quot; &quot; Trinity works better &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Andre Hop@@ mann hopes for the 2 : 2 to the season , against Br@@ uns@@ wick , that the optimization of the def@@ enses in Au@@ e points brings . &quot;
&quot; with the first season , Andre Hop@@ mann was satisfied with the result also , as not the two oppos@@ ers had been at 2 : 2 against uns@@ wick . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ers too much , and we have to fit into Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the defensive player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Ore Mountains the tri@@ angles should also be optimized further .
&quot; and a gate after a fre@@ eway , the For@@ tun@@ es do not want to catch any more . &quot;
for the future it will be that no more next to Michael ( R@@ ensing ) is concerned .
&quot; Hoff@@ mann is convinced that his team is better to cope with the experiences in the preparation with the Trinity , than with the four . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , but Hoff@@ mann is sure of his thing , &quot; &quot; because we have just been able to build the semi @-@ positions in KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o found@@ ries who can build them well , &quot; &quot; said Hoff@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; it is a prerequisite , but that we are even better harmon@@ ieren and we do not afford to make a lot of waste . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoff@@ mann moves to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; however , if you can talk to a deci@@ de@@ dly by a suspic@@ i@@ able start , I do not know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoff@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; if we can concentrate on Sunday with four points , and can concentrate on the trophy , we will certainly be able to speak of a ord@@ al season . &quot;
of which his coach wanted nothing to know .
&quot; the start into the season I will judge only after six to eight players , &quot; said Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken pre@@ matur@@ ely because of an unknown . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoff@@ mann , that players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her , since they had no heavy and complete play like Fort@@ una against a as@@ cen@@ sion to the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know such a 100 @-@ process , where they are currently standing , &quot; says the interior of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
although the guests from the Rhein@@ land go as easier favorite on Sunday to the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we carry them away , just because we have the claim to come under the first six , is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet is quite positive at just a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga which you have to strike from the outset , &quot; &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Chief coach . &quot;
&quot; such a statement would be made arrogan@@ t , and conc@@ eal . &quot;
&quot; and so , Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday on Sunday . &quot;
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ election tests published
&quot; recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden have been subjected to a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everybody believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish agency for for@@ en@@ ic medicine ( en@@ ig@@ t@@ sm@@ e@@ dic@@ ine ) has begun with the implementation of the tests last year .
&quot; they are to make more precise during the asylum process , after the Swedish migration authority ( mig@@ rations ) has been critic@@ ised because of errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees . &quot;
&quot; until today , Mig@@ rations has sent 6.@@ 8@@ 80 points and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eight@@ y percent ( 2002 ) were judged 18 or older while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency submitted that the person &quot; may be 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; in 432 cases , the conclusion that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Go@@ ran@@ sson , according to the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent with the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we do not see a big difference in statistics of last months , the numbers are rather constant , &quot; &quot; said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases where the person was judged over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has weigh@@ ed over its age . &quot;
&quot; in May the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there was 4@@ 42 cases , the &apos; suggest that the estimated person was 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det , the 5@@ 81 published results , it presented that in 243 of these cases the person had said the person openly that she will be 18 years old . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical practi@@ tioner assessment , in the x @-@ rays of We@@ ish@@ ads and MR@@ T recordings of Kni@@ fe are made , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also criti@@ ci@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tics is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of biological maturity of people to see if they were formerly or later than by pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
to assess biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; if we cannot say it certainly , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk lies in it , if the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in Plan
the works on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , there was a seven tonnes of severe emphasis on the bridge at the eastern local entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very well in time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , buil@@ ders at the Department of Road@@ beings and Transport in the Government of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , working at the same time began on all three sandy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the building is scheduled for October , and it is certain that the schedule will be respected . &quot;
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a mer@@ cen@@ sion @-@ bridge from concrete , which is dressed with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total @-@ length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
she was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure the stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly re@@ constructed . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
the bridge on the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Wednesday on Wednesday morning on the north side an 1,30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bread board .
&quot; this is a boundary attachment , which is also used as a operating path . &quot;
the southern part of the bridge is to be used on Friday a 2 metres wide range of di@@ et@@ ches .
after that it is supposed to go along the pedestrian road .
&quot; the special thing is that it is about manufacturing , a patent for the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented beads .
particular finger @-@ feeling has the embarrass@@ ed of lines by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; because there is also a glass cable , where many companies are connected . &quot;
the inhabitants were notified in advance of the work by hand notes on the project .
&quot; in addition , the fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be dis@@ solved . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building building and the collection @-@ mounted in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic is regulated by a traffic zone . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the altitude of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is closed . &quot;
the cost of the three Br@@ ück@@ ani@@ ans are at 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ oured in protest with German potato salad
&quot; it does not come so frequently that parties go on a string , but when it comes to an alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to bring under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented on the Krei@@ stag group represented parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad coalition , which shows that the Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell in the noisy poster . &quot;
&quot; and well @-@ known names to the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ del , which together with Alexander Gau@@ land the top @-@ duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September forms , and the Vice President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the after@@ no@@ ons but to demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colour@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; originally , the city @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the fountain place , but now take place in the parking place below the bl@@ onde place - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ m event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colour@@ ful picture that offers itself out .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the Forums One World and one of the leading organizers , really rejoice : &quot; great , how many people came here together . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D without problems , &quot; says the woman who has brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police has acquired many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence in particular at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how is the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D volcano @-@ fel reported that he tries to make such an event and get the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation , because because of the built @-@ built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes is not available enough parking available . &quot;
&quot; therefore the Ron@@ dell &apos;@@ Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; overlooking the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does it : at 20 am provides a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle various Red@@ ner , among them the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz @-@ president Uwe boy . &quot;
&quot; in the hall about 200 people , that are waiting for the top did@@ acy for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chairman of Stor@@ ch of Stor@@ k hold their speeches . &quot;
&quot; unchanged is the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; somewhat more than an hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but even there is short after 9 p.m. Au@@ fr@@ aming . &quot;
the police can be back - no special requirements .

Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart speaks about their bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese and will eat it up to the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try everything , so Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart completely open about their bis@@ ex@@ ual . &quot;
&quot; when I joined in gri@@ lled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes as a neigh@@ bor ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of Holl@@ y@@ wood@@ stars was the lead to her &quot; &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ in@@ son , who ultimately was bitter . &quot;
&quot; despite all the insured the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ o opposite the &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; I was in love with everyone I thought . &quot;
&quot; or do you believe about , I have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten gave me the fact that she is bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived the du@@ alism and seriously believed . &quot;
so I have never confused or han@@ dic@@ apped .
I have never liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them they suffered a &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; but at the school time she preferred to dress like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really has me really been in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; when I was 11 , the children , I would look like a bug . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , fright@@ ened and ash@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think to me : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
especially the public they don &apos;t like to tell their love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and become anno@@ yed me .
&quot; and maybe I call me some as und@@ ank@@ able , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a demonstration with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much night thinking ... today , I will tell you as resident of West Virginia , I can no longer assist you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the manifestation broke out in ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration for the republi@@ cans , &quot; &quot; Justice added . &quot;
&quot; as a trainer I would say it is at the time to play a different game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp promised a great announcement for the West Virginia R@@ ally .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice does not endor@@ se the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; Justice , who according to For@@ bes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the State was elected , 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes believes that he possesses coal em@@ ins in five states , and has inherited a carbon @-@ business by his father . &quot;
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee announced a statement on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; the Party change from Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party , which would rather be more closely to us than working in order to make our country again great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 gou@@ vern@@ ance and control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , happy message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ Chair R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation to C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ e pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the world &apos;s global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal but he repeated , it is not the moment for the country again to be recorded in sports . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics manager Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of athle@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct out of the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , I am sorry for &quot; all athletes , who were cut away from competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments made by the IA@@ AF Congress for maintaining the Forbidden , which was arrested in November 2015 , after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) found references to nation@@ ally promoted D@@ oping in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e the re@@ por@@ ters . &quot;
the entire Council and the entire Congress has been delighted that the Russian Federation has been aware of themselves that they experienced some pretty hot times and everything possible to make sure the Federation is re@@ designed .
&quot; he said , he was also &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ launch . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment Russia to use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added . &quot;
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes are starting on Friday in London to compete for strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
&quot; the leader of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia still meet some of the criteria for re@@ adjustment . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still inadequate and processed trainers are still working freely , he said re@@ por@@ ters in London after a talk at IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
trau@@ ma for in Mali ha@@ unted soldiers
&quot; in a grape @-@ party in the North @-@ chief Fr@@ itz@@ lar , about 1000 people of the two have been killed at a helic@@ opter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt at high security measures .
&quot; to the still un@@ resolved crash , Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) nothing . &quot;
&quot; it signed the two ren@@ amed pil@@ ots , but as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their specialist . &quot;
&quot; we worship ourselves against this highest sacrifice which they performed in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ year Stab@@ at Nord@@ h@@ essen were killed on Wednesday before a week in the West African Mali .
&quot; your har@@ row were transferred to Germany , and accompanied by a total guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Cathedral St. Peter . &quot;
at noon we first took only the relatives in the church part@@ ing .
&quot; after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , from representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot;
below were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the Direc@@ tor@@ ate of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; he laid down ros@@ es , the relatives were arms in arms to the s@@ light@@ ning . &quot;
in front of the church Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ he and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
Minister of Defense of the Ley@@ en awarded the ren@@ amed soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and to@@ wed .
the St@@ aup@@ t@@ mann has been established the flight operation of the martial @-@ helic@@ opter Tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilot of his reg@@ im@@ ents .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the reg@@ iment , which the soldiers stated , &quot; said : &quot; if this occupation could not turn the crash , then it would not have any failed . &quot;
doubts about the UN Mission in Mali showed no minist@@ ries from the Ley@@ en &apos;s mission was dangerous .
&quot; but it is also of high importance for a country by which we are separated only by two states , &quot; said . &quot;
after the funeral party the waters were brought from the cathedral .
&quot; when and when they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any information . &quot;
Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik wants no grave alongside his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , wants to be buried after his death not next to his wife . &quot;
it divided the Royal House on Thursday with .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish Royal Palace is attached to the church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard far already had a Sar@@ k@@ oph@@ ag for the two .
&quot; the Queen was in agreement with the decision of her husband , says it further in the message . &quot;
where Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik buried is still unclear .
but he did not have the intention of putting in his French homeland .
&quot; Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik had never made a secret of it , that he was not happy with his title . &quot;
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to become king .
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and put the title &quot; &quot; prin@@ c@@ als &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark do not have the title and the function he wanted , he does not see himself from his wife - not even after the death , told L@@ ene Bal@@ eby , the Chief of the Danish Royal House . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will be last , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not have the intention of being buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the land for which he has worked in the last 50 years .
&quot; Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ ocr@@ at , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
on the Thames he worked in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew , Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his barely 50 years . &quot;
&quot; in a auto@@ biography of Hen@@ rik on the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did , critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was sul@@ king , I preferred wine instead of beer , Seiden@@ str@@ ur@@ fs instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco , and the reputation had to be the brand of soci@@ etal intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ash@@ amed .
these were the same as two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants spe@@ edy re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; precip@@ itation @-@ chief Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after loss of red green ruling class for a spe@@ edy re @-@ election of the country , but he does not want . &quot;
he spoke on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament .
&quot; previously , the surprising out@@ let of a Green Party in Lower Saxony took the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a severe crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official appointment of the elections , the red @-@ green coalition of Hanover lost their scar@@ ce a @-@ vote majority in the Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the previous Green @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ ets founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for choosing 2018 in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Des@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; explained it on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U @-@ frac@@ tion@@ ef Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its Group to record them .
&quot; with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP were together 69 seats in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 . &quot;
so far was the ratio vice versa .
the new Land@@ tag will be chosen the 14th of January next year .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green regional government must now decide whether they can gover@@ n in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it to be indispensable for the country &apos;s day as quickly as its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U fac@@ tion is expected to proceed on Tuesday to proceed .
the state version also provides the possibility that the Prime Minister supports the Prime Minister and elect a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these options must be considered legally clean , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; it will be considered in calm all questions , if they are legally checked . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ wes@@ ens step &quot; but something cur@@ i@@ os .
the policy@@ makers himself said : &quot; I am not tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it referred to as a tr@@ ailers of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens also called for the S &amp; D Euro to return their country state .
&quot; of course we assume that she has received her Land@@ tag@@ and@@ at who has received her about the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; shared the CEO Met@@ a J@@ ans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
the presidents of the Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ una . &quot;
they have deliberately decided to do not have a debate in the group .
&quot; also against the background that there were no contex@@ tual differences , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot;
SPD @-@ registr@@ ar Martin Schulz condemned the survi@@ ves of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Green @-@ Parliament El@@ ke T@@ una to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ y@@ al .
&quot; the behavior of the former Gre@@ ens &apos; s in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ y@@ al of the elect@@ or@@ ate , but also betra@@ y@@ al in red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the Federal Minister of Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he ass@@ ass@@ ed the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly choose the country &apos;s day .

&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ f@@ tei@@ ern , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discussed with si@@ gh@@ ing eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect consumers .
Land@@ scape Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt : How can consumers protect against waste management ?
I can only encourage all consumer within and to review the eggs in your refrigerator accurately and check the stamp @-@ up print .
at the consumer portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ing.com represent the most recent information on the affected egg @-@ Char@@ ge .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if according to everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically impossible . &quot;
&quot; now Al@@ di has the best possible crisis action - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enlight@@ ening of the federal government is not really perceived ?
the food surveillance is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately switched off and has been subject to disclosure of Germany in close interaction with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
&quot; trade has just as much as the makers to ensure that the sold @-@ selling products are busi@@ est , and health@@ ful harmless . &quot;
&quot; if at eggs of the high level content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg exceeded that this is not the busi@@ est . &quot;
un@@ contaminated eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time is not the companies to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the time , the production facility does not meet immediate debt . &quot;
&quot; instead , they must count on illegal illegal practices of services with economic damages . &quot;
as always there is too little control in the harvest .
is it only on the personal or also at the extreme jurisdiction ?
&quot; however , it was just the official controls that have exposed the procedure . &quot;
&quot; however , the truth is also that food fraud and criminal energy will never be excluded to 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; this is why a consistent clarification of such events and the hand@@ over to the pro@@ secution in the cases where crimes can be pre@@ dominant , of decisive importance . &quot;
&quot; I have already done several times a number of times , that I expect a complete explanation by the responsible authorities . &quot;
is the regular alarm clock for food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumer employees and consumers have the right to get only safe and hass@@ le @-@ capable foods .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide are used in the food industry , consumers and consumers are rightly ou@@ trag@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; by pan@@ elled resources , manufacturers , distributors and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of insec@@ ti@@ cides fi@@ pr@@ on@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ feed animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot;
it must be consistent at all levels and on high pressure levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the atomic fact is fully up@@ lifted and fully understood .
how the financial rules of tar@@ ball affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
&quot; the rules , which aim to prevent un@@ resolved issues of European football purposes , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain would not distur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A UEF@@ A , as the leading organisation that monitors the European game has control the power , teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
financial fair @-@ play rules which have been launched by the UEF@@ A UEF@@ A means that PS@@ G must follow at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million Euro ( 262 million $ ) to recover the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will last several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make sure the money easy to make money , therefore N@@ ey@@ mar , and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy of rich ruling family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; associations should be able to purchase much money for the purchase of players , but must play with legitimate income sources , which enable them to make their break @-@ related point in their own football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini by his election as the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that they had taken tremendous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ky , to ruin , when banks or owners rep@@ el their support . &quot;
in 2011 FF@@ P declined from concentration on the debts of clubs to monitor their losses .
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the Roman A@@ br@@ amo@@ vi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential potential and then managed to build a strong investment in order to improve the team and build a global brand - become a tough@@ er affair . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P contract period , which runs up to 2018 , clubs can accept losses in the amount of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini had fallen from the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor Alek@@ s@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to be deter@@ red by excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for FF@@ P , from The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G won the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package price , they can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of his contract . &quot;
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the dra@@ in will be purchased for the next five years in the amount of 44,@@ 4 million euros during the annual financial statements .
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has reached the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a resolution of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later cut to 20 million euros later - and it has been arranged that the team members are limited to the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the otherwise ordinary 25 players . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that might try to over@@ head their financial supervision by joining the revenue by companies that are connected to the owners of a club .
&quot; while a Catalan company could exceed the PS@@ G companies , if the value of the sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not have this as legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; this was exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA was born from Qatar &apos;s Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar on payments of the Organis@@ ing Committee of the World Cup 2022 might come in Qatar .
yet PS@@ G and Qatar have been disp@@ uted that N@@ ey@@ mar Cup amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors will be considered and such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could simply figure out .
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G means that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive , any attempt to consider the rules . &quot;
UEF@@ A UEF@@ A had no pre @-@ prepared discussions with PS@@ G over N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , f@@ ted on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the final published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 will have achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros by sales of EUR 54@@ 2.1 million .
the accounts for the last financial year must be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrive a blessing to sponsorship De@@ als , merch@@ an@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ kot@@ ing purchases . &quot;
the association is assum@@ ing that sales by at least 30 percent will rise .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players to see , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s departure by suggest@@ ing that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; funded D@@ oping &quot; &quot; with the club and the State , &quot; said the President of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily newspaper , in relation to cat@@ ars the latter owner of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al Manager arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that is a society . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play , because you can have different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot;

blow against drugs @-@ Mafia in the country
the police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian m@@ af@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning at the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ B@@ aar @-@ district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart were introduced numerous objects such as the prosec@@ utor &apos;s Con@@ stance on Friday . &quot;
&quot; 15 Acc@@ ept@@ ance was arrested in the age of 25 years and 77 years ago , and passed on arrest warran@@ t against them . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials provided greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , guns , as well as several hundred thousand Euros . &quot;
at the same raid in Italy two persons were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects , there were German arrest warran@@ t . &quot;
the two will therefore probably be delivered to Germany .
at the action Italian and Bay@@ erische Educ@@ ators were involved .
&quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Mafia will be organized drugs crimin@@ ality , serious violence , tried , murder , as well as rob@@ bery and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; already in the summer of 2016 , the Prosec@@ utor Con@@ stance against the organised drug trading in the south @-@ German room has been established . &quot;
&quot; between the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Con@@ stance and Palermo , there was an exchange of exchange and investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil , had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot;
therefore the large use on Wednesday was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
&quot; in the spot@@ light of the investigations , especially Italian national , with close reference to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; also a incident occurring on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , filmed several shots in a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to move to the bank account . &quot;
way lam@@ ents large gaps in a foreig@@ ner @-@ Register
&quot; data of citizens who should not show up there , &quot; according to a report , the foreig@@ ner register in Germany shows considerable shortcomings in Germany . &quot;
the lead to partly serious mis@@ decisions in asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; the authorised for the Federal Government of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jur@@ gen , has drawn attention to a media report for large gaps in the country @-@ country register . &quot;
&quot; defects in the there recorded recorded data could result in asylum seek@@ ers and deport@@ ations , in an analysis that lies in the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the register of the property , there are ten million people with foreign nation@@ als , including approximately 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU states . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by about 600 foreigners in Germany .
&quot; because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts so far did not have been good . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases the data from 1921 has been found , &quot; by people who have long been no longer in life , or from citizens who have become the German citizen , and in the Register actually no longer should arise . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data allow@@ ances can be greatly slow@@ ing back processes , it means the report continues . &quot;
&quot; in statistics about non @-@ accountability people , these EU citizens do not have to travel out at all . &quot;
&quot; but such false inter@@ acts led to a distor@@ ted debate on dealing with travel agencies , &quot; says it therefore in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the federal government has begun to return to Italy with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they travelled from there . &quot;
&quot; this is derived from an internal paper of the Federal Ministry for Migration and refugees ( BAM@@ F ) , the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ mad@@ er Zeitung reports &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper it means therefore , the BAM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; regarding families with children - except for inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 it was practically no longer possible , so the paper addresses reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach it first . &quot;
&quot; if a mig@@ rant is travelling into another EU country , this state can return it to the trav@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; for reasons , the office has now been writing : &quot; in the meantime , the recording capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly . &quot;
Italy given a guarantee for the recording and accommodation of family warranty .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) keep these commitments for adequate .
other EU states would also return to refugees in the Dublin agreement .
&quot; the internal political speaker of the Lin@@ ks@@ fr@@ action in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , criti@@ ci@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten account of the shortcomings in the Italian Asyl@@ um System , and a haz@@ ard of the child . &quot;
second result obtained
a total of 220 lit@@ re blood of in Ober@@ ri@@ enbach living people have already provided blood service for other people .
&quot; at least from the twelve citizens , which were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in all , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now distributed 100 lit@@ res of blood with its meanwhile 100 donations . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the community in the session of the community is the multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is awesome how our body is laid out for it and we have respect the don@@ ors , which provide their blood for stran@@ gers , still un@@ sel@@ fish , under@@ score mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood don@@ ating helps more people , &quot; explained the circle manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher , because the preser@@ ves are put into their ingredients . &quot;
&quot; thus , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot;
at the same time Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher reported by the promotions that are carried out in the spring in Ober@@ r@@ enbach .
&quot; this year we achieved with 114 co@@ ders the second best result , &quot; said the DRC . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change in the theatre was led a few years ago to pay higher attendance . &quot;
&quot; before previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le , and Met@@ a Um@@ eber@@ ry to the multi@@ pl@@ edges and have been awarded for 50 months . &quot;

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England will likely appear later that the interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation reduces the spec@@ ulation about a rise .
&quot; the Bank of England has warned that the economic growth &quot; y@@ ields &quot; will remain , when they invest the interest rates on family income in the middle of an ampli@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the policy makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates on 0.25 % , whereby fewer members reached a rise in this month since the weak economic growth is weak@@ ened for a increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly report , the Bank reduced its growth progn@@ oses for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on the budget would continue , while the inflation in the fall is expected to rise to almost 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years , zinc levels would be necessary to cultiv@@ ate inflation of Bre@@ xit and she said that the credit costs would have to rise more than expected on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members agreed to withdraw a part of the Mam@@ mut signals , which was issued a year after the Bre@@ xit . &quot;
&quot; it will demand time for finance planning to provide more cheap financial resources for banks , although said that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate said the Bank : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , since pressure on the reality of households will continue to be deb@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; to the interest rates repeated them , that &quot; &quot; a certain tight@@ ening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; for cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; slightly larger &quot; &quot; extent would be expected than the markets expected . &quot;
the markets progn@@ osis for the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another one in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank empha@@ sized that increases &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are projected compared to the 1.1 % and 1.1 % compared to those in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell on these messages from the dollar and the euro .
the pounds fell around 0.5 % to the US dollars and dropped by 0.05 % to € 61 million .
the decision on any change comes after the recent dis@@ appoint growth figures increased the rising expectations on a interest rate and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.3 % in the preceding three months .
&quot; growth is expected to grow at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will be easy to recover after the Bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent In@@ fl@@ ation report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by a rising inflation and low @-@ level salary , as the shar@@ pen@@ ing first becomes even worse before they get repaired . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy cannot be able to prevent monetary policy in the coming years , but she added that wages becomes forecast for the end of their three @-@ year figures . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also reinforced by increasing demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the weak pound of what a portion of lower consumption expenses will be compens@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the decision will be a year after lowering interest rates on 0.25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the door @-@ door of the sound . &quot;
the bank appreci@@ ates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the final verdi@@ ct of the bank on interest rates , the inflation was increased after a fork of interest , since inflation continued to increased pressure on hard , with three political decision makers in July a rise on 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation is dropped last month by 2.9 % in June to 2,@@ 6 % , although the Bank said that this was anticipated and they will be back in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said the crossing in relation to its goal of 2 % is &quot; to be &quot; totally &quot; to the weak pound .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; given the recent return of s@@ wap arrangements , the mort@@ gage market is expected to be more competitive again , since the len@@ ders are looking for stores and end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market is particularly suitable for those with existing de@@ aler@@ ts and the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll @-@ free options and low frames are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) should dis@@ si@@ p@@ oured HIV @-@ Dro@@ ge 10,000 people
patients will be granted after a fight before the High Court against financing of the drug in N@@ HS access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that one before the sexual intercourse pro@@ posi@@ tional prophy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) can reduce the inf@@ ective risk of around 86 percent , now being delivered by health service through a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the process , having confirmed the appeal of the Supreme Court of Justice last year , that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the Schach@@ inger announced on Thursday , was welcomed by N@@ HS England Chef Simon Stev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) recorded this as the &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bright@@ on , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield are going to be the first who will allow registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October 2018 in April 2018 . &quot;
prevention of prophy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a consequence of HIV medicines that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p reduced the HIV transmission in infectious agents .
&quot; pre@@ p before the intercourse , means that just enough drugs in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection . &quot;
such drugs can be taken every day or just two hours before the intercourse .
&quot; those who come for treatment in question belong to gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; clinics will identify appropriate participants who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status will not be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and join a house doctor may also opt for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to judge the full potential of pre@@ p by using clinical evidence as it is used in large scale , and is implemented . &quot;
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should supplement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts for contrac@@ eption of HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
Deborah Gold &amp; Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
&quot; pre@@ p , when it is targeted towards the need@@ y and vulnerable people , the ability to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people with high HIV risk , people will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ financing attempt in England to develop a new instrument which is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be carried out in the whole country and that no one who has left a risk to HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p @-@ test medicine was accused , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p @-@ process is welcome to months of delay and delay , by the government , and over@@ due . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and stop transferring this life changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; it is now important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they are contributing to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
the great life living : mezzanine and cl@@ ever@@ e designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne L@@ eig@@ h , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced in 2014 by a large house in K@@ night@@ s@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has un@@ packed their bags and sold .
&quot; before I lived with my ex in K@@ night@@ s@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; I sought after something , which was similar to my price . &quot;
this flat was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and had the same high ceilings .
I have fallen in love with them and made an offer on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first tour the 1,000 square @-@ fox was completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ bedroom estate with a wast@@ ed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add a pasta space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; this was my request , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the architectural and Design@@ studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , the 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two spaces , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine , where you could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think creative in order to release the award .
&quot; the steel station is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were ski@@ pped over , without that we had to die . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about to build a simple platform , but the steel so that he had the right height for the function or at the bottom . &quot;
this order allowed Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional action .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic coupl@@ ing windows can look down from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us via the gl@@ am@@ orous living area . &quot;
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , sil@@ ber@@ ne ac@@ ente and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumin@@ ates the style for the program . &quot;
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
at both ends is a short cor@@ ridor mir@@ r@@ ored to leave him longer .
in the kitchen the mir@@ r@@ ored like a window feels like another room .
at the entrance there are mir@@ r@@ ored units square for all seating and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ am@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
what is special about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering art went into , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the st@@ ahl@@ reinforced , fur@@ ni@@ fied M@@ DF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is item so important , so when you push the door very easily , very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the cl@@ ever@@ ly use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could win additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the basic surface - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and a calculation can perform based on the bottom size . &quot;
&quot; here they have managed to enlarge the floor area , while also use high quality materials , which give the room to its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into the electric plugs , in the walls . &quot;
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
&quot; it shows that an apartment can be transformed by good design and increased square met@@ er@@ ous , some by a little admir@@ able in something completely amazing . &quot;
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave these not . &quot;
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollars
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confrontation because of one of the largest property of the Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their ownership and its business shall be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw himself from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate about the separation is held in the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna the brothers 38 properties have collected 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co Je@@ ans family established a chain of 160 retailers . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt bull as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; following an agreement with its dec@@ eased father possesses Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; &quot; main operator and domin@@ ating personality &quot; &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the enterprise &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a jurisdiction which means that Col@@ in property is owned by 3@@ 16 million dollars and Paul valued at 176 million dollars .
the division of property and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; those of Col@@ in proposed divisions have left him with the left which I held for the best objects , &quot; wrote in 2015 in a first monkey av@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; on the last Friday , there was several failed to receive the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which , as Paul claims to him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but raises Paul preceding , some pos@@ sessions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early monkey av@@ it , which was filed in Col@@ in , he says he hope to present the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs arise in the case , with hundreds of sites with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides held in law firms . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her husband Luigi Luigi were Italian immigrants to bought the milk bars and delic@@ acy stores of the late 1950 @-@ er years and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood @-@ property , in which Col@@ in the first Je@@ ans@@ es of the family opened . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began to West@@ co , when he was in High School when he was a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed their property to pass over to her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land the brethren , she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis @-@ Group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark has been paid by the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; Luke and Mark , he says Paul &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in has held back very back , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and was following a biography in 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyer .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much &quot; &quot; because the case before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to mo@@ urn me and to drag our family name by the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in the middle of 2016 Col@@ in has written Col@@ in in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our Father had not meant that Paul and I would like to end in our current contro@@ versy , &quot; he said and added that he still hope to find a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our business will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s new St@@ ef is planning to limit the media ab@@ stin@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico reports that the new St@@ ef of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Tru@@ mp , including the reports of the news media - in the hope to keep the boss at a simultaneous course . &quot;
here is a piece of Repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new St@@ ef of the White House , met on his first working day with leading employees , he exhibited a main problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s of the White House which he wants to repair w@@ ool : poor information , into the hands of the president . &quot;
Kelly said the staff that information on him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring its media advis@@ es . &quot;
&quot; President Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship with television dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if it was anno@@ yed by Tru@@ mp because of an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of places that were to convince , &quot; said the former electoral advis@@ er Sam Nun@@ berg in February to the Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep the Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaign , to ensure that his personal media use includes a constant praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter @-@ habit ever was under control &quot; is ridicul@@ ous .
perhaps these campaign tr@@ ams do something that we do not know others - that Tru@@ mp@@ s T@@ we@@ ets could not contain any more gri@@ ps without their intervention .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets which Tru@@ mp has not been sent .
&quot; if he managed to maintain his employees some times , anger from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; but no one has consistently prevented it , that Tru@@ mp control has emerged . &quot;
&quot; part of the problem consists in the fact that people in a White House embr@@ aces up from competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by promoting Tru@@ mp material that may possibly fo@@ sters their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the fon@@ dness of the consultants , the president for strategic reasons to bring out beyond doubt . &quot;
this was an example that was described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp @-@ officials say that Tru@@ mp may react to negative press sections , especially such with damaged le@@ aks and that it comes to out where these origin@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone featured a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy rod of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap to be of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was ban@@ ished because of chic@@ ks permanently from Twitter or that he has offered no concrete evidence , or that he expressed false alleg@@ ations in the past and vo@@ ke her . &quot;
Tru@@ mp read the article and started to wonder people about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; added that the dam@@ al St@@ ef Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ si@@ ves Self , and his consultants are still looking for influence . &quot;
these un@@ change@@ able factors make wa@@ ist mission very difficult .
Master &apos;s crimin@@ als get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the assistance of the population will pray and hop@@ ed . &quot;
the police across Europe will be ma@@ iled this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
&quot; since the addresses of the searched heavy @-@ bre@@ cher natur@@ es are not known , references from the population will be hop@@ ed and worship . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , followed by the &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; &quot; calendar of winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences had shown that many wings are hiding at the destination places , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
I have compiled 21 post@@ cards for searched crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wijk has been viewed more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online @-@ sought entry could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them based on the publication on the website . &quot;
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; milli@@ on@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est domestic land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are once again tr@@ aded with some strong travelers on war@@ fs that have tr@@ aded a field in front of their manor houses .
&quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road from Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; milli@@ on@@ aire series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of tran@@ sports , after they were turned down in May , without being de@@ duc@@ ted by any of the Council to prevent their accidents . &quot;
&quot; the tac@@ tical group found a gap in the defence plant and op@@ pressing their cars by a section , which remained un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted to find a way . &quot;
&quot; fur@@ ious inhabitants have pus@@ hes the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabitants said , &quot; They were there on the assembly , after they were sent again from Bentley He@@ ath , where they were thrown stones for pas@@ sers . &quot;
&quot; the Council has to be forced by sharp@@ ness to implement in action , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
the travelers were in May there were moved and are now back .
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to handle it by keeping long instructions to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets Road and I am not happy to keep my ways to pay , if the Council can &apos;t even stop it . &quot;
&quot; a local community not to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it is ridicul@@ ous , we just saw the last round of these travelers , just to be pl@@ agu@@ ed by another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and even one has seen a horse in the par@@ quet area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; we are conscious of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets Road and working with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so as to proceed as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our knowledge collection , it is very important that as many people report a anti @-@ social or criminal conduct in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation where the court has to check , when we present our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former hotel Birken@@ hof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ l is currently being renovated and will be back on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the Hotel Birken@@ hof , the 13th of April 2014 met approximately 30 000 nights per year and also revenue from the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the autumn of 2014 , in view of dramatically rising numbers of refugees , which were offered at the land district , the hotel building of the country house as a collective accommodation , which was provided for contro@@ versy . &quot;
the city prevented the lodging of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building planning to secure the territory as a hotel location .
the decision was not disp@@ uted at that time in the community .
&quot; but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s Upper O@@ ss@@ wald , Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke at that time of serious prosp@@ ective buyers in the house . &quot;
he should keep right .
&quot; group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a voluntary sur@@ au@@ ction in Berlin , and will return it to a house of the three @-@ star @-@ Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Man@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you are hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former hotel Birken@@ hof have been standing by the entrance for a longer time in the entrance , and if one enters the house it becomes clear , what extensive renovation work will be made . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils have been demol@@ ished , blankets to cut off , old bath@@ tubs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
till March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black @-@ style style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large gif@@ ted showers , the entrance area will be re@@ designed , there will be new windows built . &quot;
&quot; everything sol@@ ves later &quot; &quot; beautiful &quot; &quot; become &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer express . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewelry piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment . &quot;
&quot; if one would not want to position on the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , even on an up@@ scale city level , empha@@ sizes Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its roughly 60 rooms set up broad , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; individual holi@@ day@@ makers , groups or busin@@ ess@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
discussions with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism @-@ Director Michael Kr@@ ause already led to Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are equal to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investments in demand , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to determine exactly . &quot;
&quot; almost under one million euros , he counts . &quot;
the outside plants are also brought to Vorder@@ mann that is already clearly visible .
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is publicly available from the restaurant , which is publicly available . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : us @-@ Special Offers Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia Aff@@ aires about the U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp , Robert Mu@@ eller shall have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury as a report . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks the Panel recorded work in recent weeks , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote on appeal to the subject of familiar persons . &quot;
the paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded his investigation and intensified .
the CN@@ N channels reported it will give the first pre @-@ lad@@ ders of the body in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s and a Russian lawyer .
&quot; U.S. intelligence services accused of the Krem@@ lin since long , targeted in the presidential election in 2016 . &quot;
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there was an agreement between Tru@@ mp@@ s El@@ ection team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of investigation , several men are to stand in the electoral campaign as a consultant of the republi@@ cans . &quot;
&quot; according to reporting , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s private and business environment among the magni@@ fier . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; wrote some weeks ago that the Sonder@@ investig@@ ator Tru@@ mp have worked personally to the center and submit the accus@@ ation if the president may hin@@ dered the judiciary in the course of the affair . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand y@@ ys is to check out the proof of possible inter@@ rup@@ tions , and decide whether the indic@@ t@@ ment is being raised . &quot;
Grand j@@ uries are therefore called the counts .
mostly they are turned on when it deals with bigger and contro@@ versy cases .
the procedure is always done behind closed doors .
&quot; in addition , the Panel can also be turned on from the prosec@@ utor to rech@@ arge people for hearing under E@@ id . &quot;
&quot; according to the CN@@ N channels of CN@@ N , pre @-@ lad@@ ders were already issued in order to turn the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ R. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
individuals who were involved in the meeting may be asked to a statement called it in the report .
&quot; moreover , they should provide documents . &quot;
beside Tru@@ mp J@@ R. were also Tru@@ mp@@ s consultants and swi@@ eg@@ ers@@ ohn Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his dam@@ al electoral chef Paul Man@@ a@@ fort .
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in U.S. television , that the composition is showing that Mu@@ eller should not engage in his work shy and that he should be necessary to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on the end to decide on the collection of an indic@@ t@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the composition of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the studies and a new cause of concern for President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the new revelations , the president announced a speech in West Virginia to portr@@ ay the Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia @-@ story is a total invention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the Democrats give the democr@@ ats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else about which they can talk . &quot;
his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in an opinion that he didn &apos;t know anything from the placement of a Grand Jury .
&quot; but this work also usually in the secret , he stressed . &quot;
&quot; the White House fears all measures , which accelerated the work of the special agent in &quot; fair &quot; way . &quot;
the former F@@ BI chef James Com@@ ey was told three times that not against the President .
&quot; you have no reason to accept that something has changed , it was on the explanation . &quot;
Mu@@ eller was only used only after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had been fired .
&quot; because of this ration@@ ality , there were alleg@@ ations against Tru@@ mp , he wanted to hin@@ der the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey , in June before a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp have asked him for setting the investigation of the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
according to the representation of U.S. media gathered the White House material against the Sonder@@ investig@@ ators and his staff .
the prov@@ oked spec@@ ulation about it whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wants .
&quot; unlike any independent Special Offers of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair concerning the later returned President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which it could be strengthened on the ur@@ ging of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to bow one such step but prev@@ ent@@ able .
&quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic Sen@@ ators set up the Thursday law@@ suit , after which the special car@@ ver could no longer be released . &quot;
Antarc@@ tic : gigantic Eis@@ berg drives in the Antarc@@ tic
in the West@@ ant@@ arc@@ tic has solved a gigantic ic@@ eberg of the hot@@ ter &apos;s size of Berlin by barely si@@ eben@@ tish size of Berlin .
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar@@ - and marine research on Wednesday .
&quot; the size of a Bil@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers big pist@@ on t@@ rei@@ be now to the North and I will probably need two , three years until he was mel@@ ted . &quot;
it is a width of 175 kilometers in length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the biggest ic@@ it@@ ants who registered the researchers in the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
&quot; however , the climate change has played a role in stopping the ic@@ eberg , is unclear in research information . &quot;
&quot; overall , there has been a series of unusual inter@@ rup@@ tions in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact@@ ant background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , it can be related to the heating of the warming . &quot;
the t@@ geb@@ ro@@ ch@@ ene Col@@ os@@ sus was so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ s .
Schel@@ che@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks down .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ s is located south of South America almost on the top of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula .
north of this Schel@@ fe@@ ises was the balance of w@@ ax@@ les and abor@@ ting break up a couple of years ago .
&quot; a complete Schel@@ che@@ ers be there , writes AW@@ I researcher by Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; I am talking about it , that even the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ es are in danger , because the pre@@ valent edge have never gone back as far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ic@@ e@@ plate under voltage and can be dis@@ inf@@ ested , if at a key@@ point , there is a piece of bre@@ wing . &quot;
the mel@@ ting of Schel@@ che@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level as it pus@@ hes on the water and pus@@ hes ice as much water as it returns after the mel@@ ting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of the sperm count that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in the lesser extent , writes the British research project to observe the Antarc@@ tic ( MID@@ AS ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ che@@ s is after AW@@ I @-@ information with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the fourth largest Schel@@ che@@ ers of the Antarc@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; at the transfer from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front @-@ edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters . &quot;
there it regularly breaks down .
&quot; although it is a natural gift and not a direct connection to climate change is aware , the ice is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y said by the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the wid@@ est retreat from the beginning of the recording , &quot; he confirmed . &quot;
&quot; under scientists be disp@@ uted whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ s can now grow again or go back in the long @-@ term , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even if these researchers will not lead the break@@ down of this gigantic ic@@ eberg , so in the past few decades , there are many king@@ doms of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula . &quot;
&quot; this long time of the Antarc@@ tic , extends in the direction of South America . &quot;
according to data from the British Antarc@@ tic Survey the Ic@@ ef@@ ist of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula has gone back to 28 000 square kilometers .
&quot; in the decline , the temperature resistance has contributed . &quot;
&quot; the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula has grown in over 50 years by around three degrees warmer and tough so to the areas where the temperature is at the fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants to go home sti@@ if at the staff
&quot; because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy the vac@@ ancy bodies , the CD@@ U , out of the work@@ station association , to be more attractive . &quot;
only shortly before the summer break the chal@@ ke has 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 staff and officials work for the roundabout in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have given their first working day behind .
the teaching in the circle are obviously very popular .
around 620 applicants were for this year to deliver in v@@ ain places .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle continues to be able to cope with the increasing requirements and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there is still 50 not occupied by the Circle M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
among other things doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are needed .
the CD@@ U would now like to take the initiative with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; the management is to work out by the wish of the parties &quot; &quot; a concept for recruitment and human business development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term needs of skilled workers but future @-@ oriented of the application , is said . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented towards inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers , and include an apprentic@@ eship , calling for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this already sounds like a good approach .
&quot; because the circle has to do with personal problems , which you didn &apos;t know before . &quot;
other cities promote good officials and staff and offer more attractive terms .
the speech is of a down@@ right &quot; contest of public employers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a high number of employees , the disease or altern@@ ating may be ex@@ cre@@ ded out of the service . &quot;
&quot; so , the highest time for action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common request . &quot;
he had a long time in the cra@@ e@@ day for a lazy surprise when he was publicly challenged the human resources and fl@@ ashed the remaining parties .
&quot; people want to be verified , that all possibilities will be verified , which allow a withdrawal from the communist workers &quot; association . &quot;
&quot; if we are not at short notice to a satisfactory solution , the roundabout should strive for trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the circular cities - a door@@ step , so peoples . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the CD@@ U , the employees and officials trying to pay better than the collective service is actually looking for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently precisely prescribed , enh@@ ancements or more money is only when you move into a higher level that adap@@ ts itself to vocational years . &quot;
&quot; however , the tasks of the circle has grown more and more over the past years . &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up , in which to take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law . &quot;
&quot; last but not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ eder Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little personnel . &quot;
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ated the tone to NGOs @-@ migrants
&quot; Italy entitled NGOs to use the lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , war@@ ns that they will not continue , if they do not keep on new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not write new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; &quot; said Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner Daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ niti@@ s warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized the boat of the German relief organization &quot; youth R@@ ettet &apos; conf@@ isc@@ ated , because their team had worked effectively with crowds ac@@ credit@@ ors in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the aid organisation that has only been in operation for a year , rejected it to detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate at the moment in the search and b@@ ail@@ out zone , &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can accept all alleg@@ ations that are currently raised , after we collect all the information and can judge the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; youth deer &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , super@@ vised since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that its occupation is infl@@ atable boat on board , which can be delivered directly from human hands , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used again , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least such a coincidence that was supposedly only 1,3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the pro@@ secution of the prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected , over the authority of the Italian coastal guard , super@@ vised the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
under the Code of Con@@ duct you must have boats like I@@ u@@ v@@ enta above all an Italian police officers on board that monitors their activities .
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations , have so far been willing to keep themselves up to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they do not bring any &quot; essential changes or disability &quot; of their b@@ ail@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization doctors without borders ( M@@ SF ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants led to the rescue operations in Italy , in recent weeks , that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast and the cooperation with the local citizens . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives , and with Ch@@ ad , N@@ iger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants that have left these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin &quot; out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz , to enjoy four days long tri@@ als and sights . &quot;
there were three be@@ friend@@ ed guides available for them .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome Extra .
the first tour led during hot summer temperatures along the vineyard to Micha@@ el@@ sk@@ ap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; it followed view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the fal@@ si@@ zer forest and the front levels . &quot;
&quot; in between there was always a long run , for the long tri@@ p@@ as rewards . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest .
&quot; again , look@@ out to look@@ out , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
in the last two days a lot of height were cancelled .

&quot; the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later , the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally followed by the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , the middle of July established an e @-@ sport department and took two professionals to play FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to ama@@ ze this very new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Executive Board of Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
it is certain that there is still a few steps to go on this turn .
&quot; at the coming weekend , football @-@ world association organised FIFA in London the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; with which the gam@@ ers compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain , or the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven . &quot;
also Robin Dut@@ t sees great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the Ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Lever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen meanwhile advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football has to argue with the 14 to 30 year @-@ olds , that young people also go into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : trying to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sports athletes under the treaty , one could be at the same time more often on these markets than once a year to send the Bundes@@ liga to Asia . &quot;
what is it exactly ?
&quot; at the E @-@ Sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 &quot; , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or just the football simulation of FIFA on competition level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in normal sport also , Li@@ ke is established , in which the pros can compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and with Asi@@ ans , E @-@ sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it all about a proper sport ?
for many things the idea is most common .
also In@@ go f@@ rob@@ ous has long been faced with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German sport school in Cologne , e @-@ sports is a sport because it is com@@ peti@@ tive and a lot of biological and physical reactions show that one can also find in classical sport - for example increased heart rate , stock@@ ings , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there need cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick response ability . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should not only be trained not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte , players is a good player . &quot;
&quot; however , F@@ rob@@ ous sees also problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot;
controls are difficult to accomplish in online games and in the scene missing the structures of classical sports .
positive highlights the scientists highlights the high inclusive effect of e @-@ sport .
&quot; players are on their way around , which is like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultur@@ alism . &quot;
a study of corporate consulting Del@@ o@@ itte and the association &apos;s Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the e @-@ sport a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; in order to be implemented in Germany 50 million euros , primarily on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales of 130 million are expected to lie . &quot;
&quot; against the barely 2,@@ 4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga it is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is not far from the other established sports like hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ hock@@ ey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
international are many countries already on .
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez at the US team NR@@ G e@@ Sports participate .
Hollywood @-@ actor Ashton Car@@ cher is investing in the e@@ Sport @-@ competitions Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe is doing a lot .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , E @-@ sport was introduced as schol@@ astic , says F@@ rob@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the football @-@ pri@@ liga are con@@ fer@@ ed to Dut@@ ch@@ as , an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ member of the R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only in no@@ stalgia to fall , and the ancient times has to be clear today is no longer sufficient . &quot;
&quot; it is about keeping the tradition of the association , but to al@@ ign the company at the same time . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says Dut@@ t . &quot;
&quot; there is no doubt that only in football , it is all that remains as it always was . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter because of the texts , the Con@@ rad Roy for su@@ ic@@ ide &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encourages her boyfriend to su@@ ic@@ ide by lyrics and calls for su@@ ic@@ ide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condem@@ nation behind bars and five years were exposed to par@@ ole . &quot;
Carter was sentenced on 13 July 2014 by Con@@ rad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ think@@ able .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter must remain free until calling the appeal .
&quot; it has been faced with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red p@@ ants and a cre@@ me@@ ated bl@@ ouse , Carter as with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down in the eyes , as she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have been given Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she ended his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility over , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has shown no rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ rier lawyer said , &quot; &quot; it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance , which it is totally de@@ plor@@ able . &quot;
&quot; but judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , he did not find that their &quot; age or maturity or even her cl@@ ergy &apos;s disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor las a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said there is no day on which I pray not the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want to be proud of me and how I am going to go with everything . I try , despite all my sor@@ eness that we shall bear for eternity with us to be there for his sisters , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will never be pursued by the cog@@ nition &quot; &quot; that she would never be part of the wedding of her brother or would be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no more this only person to have , with which I was together every day since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep on me for the rest of my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the case seems to put a legal preced@@ ence , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit to another , su@@ ic@@ ide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy found dead of a carbon @-@ oxid@@ ation in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case attracted national attention to themselves , after car@@ ving text documents revealed that they had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging you on the springs of a building , pier@@ ce you myself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that they had in the two weeks before his death , while he was with his family on vacation . &quot;
&quot; in the moments ahead of his su@@ ic@@ ide she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad , and &quot; All that you have to do is to switch the altern@@ ator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter attention was sought by the death of Roy and ord@@ ained that they may benefit by any press from the case .
the case has the legal opinion .
&quot; among the few , the Carter defended , belonged to Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was sentenced in Italy due to murder of their British co @-@ resident in Italy before it acqu@@ itted for two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ Me : learn from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of the FC Bayern
that Joshua wrote me at the Audi Cup as captain tr@@ apped is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern Tr@@ aut to the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner a great season to become extra @-@ motivation since not .
&quot; something else was different on his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but since far and wide at the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er was to see he made himself a shared bond to the arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as Bavaria captain . &quot;
good the one could have been better running than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the character of Coach couldn &apos;t suggest that Kim@@ my too .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was in the youth of youth , de@@ ar@@ ants and straight out of the holiday professionals of the existing C @-@ El@@ f as a player &apos;s guide . &quot;
&quot; sugar@@ s are distributed at the ad@@ est to those who want to keep a lot , which one wants to keep in La@@ une . &quot;
&quot; who thus became au@@ ser@@ k@@ ors , to compete the heritage of Lah@@ m , can only use a small extra motivation only . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player to assume responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as a Mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
&quot; right behind , this is now its position , the white bin@@ de on the arm did her exercising . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ me play me in this grid formations like the one who can also take the rod at the best . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the un@@ played tro@@ upe . &quot;
&quot; he had the view for the whole , while many others were busy with himself . &quot;
&quot; Vid@@ al thus to over@@ play its missing fitness ( fol@@ d@@ dly hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on the devil come out to the services of the Asia trip ( fol@@ dable even only ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as , so , in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t not negative . &quot;
these are all the very good .
&quot; South went apart from Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy before the defence , both ag@@ gre@@ ed sou@@ ver@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often tough , and in addition , addi@@ le tried to be successful in the game @-@ building a few times . &quot;
his colleague Ru@@ dy gave to that the result was not as we had hop@@ ed .
but even he showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; shift , templates : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as un@@ usual this Bayern @-@ World is still for the re@@ appro@@ ve , it looked after connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy for example was not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ me a few cr@@ ack@@ ly declar@@ ations in the back of his new fellow @-@ players .
&quot; there he heard of sweet a interesting phrase : &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here , have I already been painted now . &quot;
with Bavaria you just have to win each game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he must not teach the new ones . &quot;

company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz minister : economy lo@@ af Wis@@ sings Tempo
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as an E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , a Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate . &quot;
this shows itself after more than one year in which the new economic Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region talk to T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and impeccable at the same time the old minister .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of the Association of Tri@@ er ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing will acqu@@ ires the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all@@ es@@ amt . &quot;
the biggest K@@ ehr@@ ot@@ de sees Nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the close @-@ up of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is in the primary list of the country up to the top .
&quot; this year the ministry is hoping to establish a planning method , until 2021 the building should be right . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West @-@ har@@ ung Tri@@ er , which stands in the urgent need of the German @-@ traffic plan . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to take the track in December 2020 , says Ministry of Minister Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us sees it a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competitive corporations . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Tri@@ er stri@@ ves to increase the market in supermarkets , in order to increase the paragraph in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing is an open ear for people who want to start a company , and the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Tri@@ er sees in the new Master Bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
provided is a premium of 1000 euros for the best master@@ ing and 2500 euros if gradu@@ ates are independently self @-@ employed within ten years after the Master Training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road construction will be quick facts to create , at the same time fail@@ ures it the country at the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Head of the Chamber of Chamber of Commerce Tri@@ er . &quot;
&quot; from 56 new engineers , the Wis@@ sing to set mobility in regional mobility , have so far been occupied only 29 places . &quot;
the Chamber of Industry demands more orders for external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U Fr@@ ac@@ vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ on refers to calculations of the b@@ illing station , the country of invested 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of inland roads . &quot;
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of country like the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
harvest @-@ resistant is also the previous broad@@ band construction in the country .
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the Note 3,4 . &quot;

&quot; Audi is to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face in face with a counter @-@ reaction
&quot; a day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Group said , the company is the opinion that &quot; &quot; there are intelligent options as driving limits , &quot; and referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to ban or limit . &quot;
Daim@@ ler announced on Tuesday that there are three million Mercedes vehicles to be modified in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described entrepreneurs as recall .
European automobile manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nit@@ rogen ox@@ ides , the diesel engines apply as car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ s and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of the automobile manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ alization of diesel vehicles to install poll@@ uted wast@@ es , also take to what it makes difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged to ignore the powerful car firms and ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies attempt to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen to avoid the use of so @-@ called sealing devices , which could regulate emissions when a car was tested , but with@@ standing under normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States several claims of Volkswagen were charged , others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in Germany in the motor development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected before delivery and could be brought to the United States . &quot;
&quot; Audi was included in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the Audi authorities , after the Audi authorities have installed a system to cope with the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that was focused on the United States . &quot;
&quot; the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could be Volkswagen heavy burden : the luxury car manufacturer carries a proportional to the profit of Volkswagen at . &quot;

&quot; Mor@@ dil@@ los no@@ oll@@ enn@@ es , and the laughter against the suffering &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo , was one of the most master@@ y carto@@ ons , the no@@ oll@@ enn@@ es of its figures are its trademark . &quot;
also with 85 the Argent@@ inian still works and works on a film .
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he suggested among other things as a sign for Happy cards - what makes him frustr@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
the artist has always been inspired by the artist .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo @-@ figures tum@@ ble in drawings with the sl@@ ate tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning he is still sitting at its own name even on the sign @-@ table , working on a daily basis almost ten hours . &quot;
&quot; calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ shirts , Pl@@ ush @-@ animals and watches find his initial figures continued to spread much spread worldwide . &quot;
&quot; for six years , he has been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with its figures . &quot;
&quot; the main person in the film &quot; &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; is a gir@@ affe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any test@@ es animal in his drawings - which has a thousands of men . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures in the 3D @-@ movie will speak to the cinema wall . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are saying , it is strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the screen@@ play is not written by him .
&quot; therefore , he rather puts on the TV series , which is produced more like its original design@@ ations , which is power@@ less . &quot;
lav@@ ender from Provence on climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lav@@ ender is considered due to the dro@@ ught of dro@@ pping conditions and because of the disease borne insects , which seek scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ m , expert of the agricultural research institutes in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively at risk , because the plant has led to the effects of climate change that has led much less rain in spring and fall much more in the fall . &quot;
this has effects on the life of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf Rab@@ bit , and with very dry weather there are many of it . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil lo@@ wered not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers ; it is also very qu@@ eri@@ ed for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ m said , &quot; rather than very long plant@@ ings with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; so , we have fewer parts with etheric oil . &quot;
&quot; among the solutions that are considered , are a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of the dun@@ geon of the ground , but also the bo@@ ast of plants with a protective mix of sound and water and the development of varieties that are against drying . &quot;

the ass@@ ass@@ ination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the Weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce meet to meet their plans for the reporting of the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ eas@@ eless drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security . &quot;
&quot; it has been told to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what is safer to feel secure : you are supposed to take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gran@@ ulates or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a board on the front of the room : opponents , Neutr@@ al , Verb@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; you ask the re@@ por@@ ters to propose name for each column - no proof is necessary , perc@@ eptions and pancre@@ as . &quot;
&quot; there are drug control , politicians , busin@@ ess@@ men , journalists , who are suspected , on the secret list of government or cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest on violence , and while in the whole country the cor@@ p@@ ses are ho@@ oks , there are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to be held in December 2012 after attacks and threats under federal government and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , their editors and inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake it is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs . &quot;
&quot; its lack will be deeply felt , although his presence is present everywhere - a large picture of Val@@ dez , which shows its central finger at the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts that will be his sm@@ iled face with glasses or its typical Panam@@ onte . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the Repor@@ ter discuss their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , its night@@ mar@@ es , Par@@ ano@@ ia , Par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although in 2010 a Son@@ ja &apos;s office was established to process the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists only introduced two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with the majority of those thousands of Mor@@ den , each year linked with drug trading and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely provided . &quot;
&quot; with Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still insist on dealing with the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ com@@ for@@ ting , and although the terrain is now still in tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without any information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of security , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very sil@@ ly to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , mis@@ chi@@ ds we all . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced by his car and 12 times was shot on him , presum@@ ably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; &quot; twelve river &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the cap took away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
ru@@ mo@@ urs tend to move freely to Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez there are virtually nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation in the past year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the most bloo@@ dies@@ t s@@ laughter of the country , since ri@@ val@@ ry groups struggle to fill in the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t make sure that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people are shot on the road or that the grav@@ ey@@ ard is full of mixed , two @-@ stor@@ ey mice , which are bigger than many houses for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility , &quot; if only a Kart@@ ell control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ conc@@ eptions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February the release of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val@@ ing cart@@ els in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the children , suspected gang@@ sters bought each copy of the output as soon as they were delivered to publishers . &quot;
&quot; the second error was to force Val@@ dez in her , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had released the same story to leave the country into his own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend of Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
&quot; he had so long survived , that his friends and colleagues had ann@@ ex@@ ed that he would always be there . &quot;
&quot; he was in 2003 as an experienced re@@ por@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined forces with five colleagues for the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter the smo@@ k@@ d@@ ote problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; at the time the newspaper earned a reputation because of the cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising . &quot;
&quot; re@@ por@@ ters love to publish hard @-@ wise studies without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were intri@@ gu@@ ed by a publication in which they could read stories that anyone else handle . &quot;
eight years after the creation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history , wherever they lead . &quot;
he gave voluntarily to that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to live on , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug trading in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you have to take the task which falls as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what have you done in view of so many still@@ s ... why did you not say what was going on ?
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missing Val@@ dez , the spa@@ wn@@ bird , which was like a port workers , the friend , who knew generous with h@@ ugs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survived . &quot;
you trust on his routine .
he would always wear his guard .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and there is always sitting there at the same table . &quot;
now ask her : was his love for the routine to be routine ?
his death also comp@@ elled them to ask their own assu@@ mp@@ tions about how they do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; they do not like it if you are dealing with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their insi@@ di@@ ous starting point and run@@ ways , to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ keeping . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ in@@ markets .
if it smells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ se , that &apos; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happened to J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , such as he and others are saying , are in Sin@@ alo@@ a not more - just as did in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , VER@@ AC@@ RU@@ Z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a poison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government agencies are at home . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the room where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly there were no mobile phones allowed . days previously was known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; out there were two polic@@ emen , protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree . &quot;
they were asked by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class area of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the mit@@ ter , some of the re@@ por@@ ters were asking if these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen , which the Gover@@ nor himself is not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the re@@ por@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug @-@ gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
for the issue of this week Ri@@ odo@@ ce has blo@@ wn on three main stories .
there was the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the former known box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the state of government who focused on the hom@@ etown of the Govern@@ ors .
&quot; and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , an ab@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word on who kidn@@ apped or what it happened , so caution was advisable when it was time to write that everybody in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally from drug retailers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ por@@ ter made from public records , that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy , who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , which dominated almost the whole century of all political levels . &quot;
recently several pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ class cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ por@@ ter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went a military attack . &quot;
only a few months ago the readers had seen the Kolum@@ ne of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about kidn@@ apping .
&quot; sooner we have known what happened , &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; because of its sl@@ ender body . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez became a storage room for characters and sti@@ ckers , dedicated to the Mor@@ de of journalists , because the employees have become something which they themselves would never expected , activists in the name of the press . &quot;
&quot; re@@ por@@ ter Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez away a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning , because of another journalist at the office of the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office . &quot;
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing , that it is its . &quot;
journalists all over the country have become more powerful than they have been written in organized protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on hearing and construction .
&quot; on this day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away from Washington and tried to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; in a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a , on the day following the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Val@@ dez accused Ram@@ i@@ rez the authorities , journalists sp@@ ose and bring it because they said the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has since been asked for that she is re @-@ shared by the government , because it is concerned that their anger has in@@ ju@@ red their obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico organized by organised crime , to be involved in government bodies and a consistent society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that re@@ por@@ ter are not only killed by medications , but also on command of politicians and security guards , organized with organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Media W@@ äch@@ ler group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; has conducted more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico @-@ minded you , because they want you dis@@ proportionate the mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
obviously the Mor@@ de have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody is for@@ getting the death of the blog@@ ger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; your body was found along with a note that alleg@@ edly signed by the Z@@ etas @-@ Card : &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer@@ ized and ear@@ phones were beside their separated head .
some branch have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ro@@ sl@@ ava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did according to the ass@@ ass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez publicly addressed the drug card with a editorial article on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists are flo@@ wn out of their home @-@ states or even from the land .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile and they still watch the roads and look for dangers .
&quot; and sometimes they are h@@ unted , as apparently the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , who had been mur@@ dered together with four women in one apartment in Mexico @-@ city three months after the flight from VER@@ AC@@ RU@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay back and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , gives that the drug trading is terri@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and therefore I became re@@ por@@ ter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight of the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce was on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , when all their phones began to reach . &quot;
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with absor@@ b@@ ri@@ v@@ als and security complex@@ es near the seaside Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated on as it was promised by a number of Kart@@ ell em@@ bassies in the region .
&quot; from the dr@@ ones , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via cell phone . &quot;
the front page had to be changed the next day .
&quot; Sir@@ ups , near to - another shooting in the area . &quot;
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a look at the polic@@ emen , the guard stopped to see if they were in readiness . &quot;
&quot; when they were afraid of , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the vast portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , the Mittel@@ finger was visible for quite Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed its marks . &quot;
&quot; how you can also only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ y@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; said Mr Bo@@ y@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; said Mr J@@ avier , the intern me asked me to send it to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used to so@@ ften its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue when a fright@@ ening .
&quot; researchers have found that the first findings of the unbelievable no@@ horn of a Canadian mountain labor@@ ers were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that she was even noticed that his go@@ dly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said , she could have had something of a &quot; &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology &quot; drew him as &quot; the b@@ owned din@@ osau@@ rs , which was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens in the world . &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of chal@@ k time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved condition has researchers , who describe it as &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Geo@@ graphic is the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ fres@@ ser that best preserved F@@ ossi@@ l of its kind .
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was located on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something that appeared from the surrounding cliff error on board , and decided to see more accurately . &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered F@@ ossi@@ l was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2.@@ 500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy ground . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished product is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you just think a little with your eyes , you could almost believe it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is visible . &quot;
&quot; it will come into the history of knowledge as one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ rs specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this plant @-@ e@@ aters , although he is like with a arm@@ or covered and a changing tanks , probably endangered by meat fres@@ co@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strongly ar@@ ched din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , and used a shi@@ el@@ ding technology that is used as a counter@@ ing , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed it to mix better in his surroundings and to do@@ dge his enemies , say experts , which indicates that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was made for the first time head@@ lines and now is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta striking after the Muse@@ um@@ st@@ echni@@ ker Mark Mitchell , one of a team who spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully . &quot;
the amazing conservation of the specimen made it to Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern as well as the form of thr@@ ust and ar@@ mo@@ urs about his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter sh@@ aded , a widespread defence method in the animal @-@ rich , meaning that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than its bottom . &quot;
&quot; although the counter sh@@ ady is common , the results are surprising since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today . &quot;
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs was h@@ unted by sufficient pressure by meat fres@@ cos din@@ osau@@ rs that the evolution em@@ itting the confrontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most contemporary animals that employ the counter sh@@ ady - think of deer , z@@ eb@@ ras or g@@ ush @-@ animals - are much smaller and viol@@ able than loo@@ t , which was sign@@ aled that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behaviour on a massive , strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs must have been the cra@@ yon time , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their sc@@ ales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs was brown .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal on references to his life , including his conc@@ erted Dar@@ min@@ ent , to find out what it had eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs died , when he died , into a river , and driven into the sea where he went on the backs to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alberta were as warm as south @-@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much more displ@@ aced than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preser@@ v@@ atives skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and ret@@ ains the original form of the beast , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal is almost exactly the same as in the early chal@@ k time .
&quot; you do not need much imagination to use it to design it . if you just have a little bit with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time , when giant thermal opo@@ da , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r , which rose up on two legs , the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the bo@@ ar@@ ched din@@ osau@@ rs was h@@ unted by some of its fright@@ ened ancestors . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , one 38 feet ( 11,@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy mon@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta received after death in the sea and by mud m@@ um@@ i@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum it is the pun@@ ched din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ aments , and is complete from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long peaks , ranging from its shoulders . &quot;
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ aters rus@@ hed through the Western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded into the open sea . &quot;
but the under@@ side of the din@@ osau@@ rs kept his arm@@ our in an exquisite detail .
&quot; the resi@@ dual rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well received , that the door@@ ways are still a b@@ ump@@ y cor@@ pus@@ hes along the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Geo@@ graphic is such a level of preservation so &apos; rarely as a win in the Lot@@ to .
&quot; the more I ans@@ es , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of the skin cover still the hol@@ pri@@ ght tank , which carry the sk@@ ull of the beast . &quot;
&quot; his right for@@ ef@@ oo@@ t lies on his side , his five fingers are split up . &quot;
I can count the sc@@ ales on his sole . &quot;
in the storm : mass@@ ages at A@@ 8 : many wounded
violent accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 cars are involved in a mass@@ acre of massage .
&quot; there are numerous wounded , long distances - and G@@ af@@ fer . &quot;
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) on the late Thursday morning at a mass@@ ages about 20 people have been in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; after initial data of the police were at 5 : 00 between the junction Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a th@@ under@@ storm nearly 30 cars , which is probably also trucks . &quot;
&quot; over the exact number of the wounded , there was no information posted . &quot;
it is light up to moderate injury but a polic@@ eman said .
a large listing of b@@ ail@@ out tools was at the accident .
the A@@ 8 was fully locked in direction of Munich .
&quot; in Munich in Munich , a long time ago he formed a few kilometres long back . &quot;
&quot; like a AZ re@@ por@@ ter , it also occurred on the cross @-@ car to massive disabilities - through numerous sur@@ af@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the fire bri@@ g@@ ade re@@ ates the hall@@ marks of the vehicle , who now have to reck@@ on with delicate pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. there was still another accident on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; thus , it was a coll@@ ision between a car @-@ car and a car . &quot;
a rescue @-@ helic@@ opter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group test@@ et &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everybody has experienced once : nothing is looking at the train and sleeps .
or it is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
&quot; comes the creator and ar@@ ouses an uns@@ ett@@ ed , or pull the driver right out of the work@@ flow . &quot;
driver check @-@ control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn are currently the perfect driver check @-@ check .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you have taken his place and de@@ valu@@ ate the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test operation is running on two routes . &quot;
&quot; comes the offer , wide we make it out . &quot;
&quot; it is then expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; said a train speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is called the train the tickets de@@ valuation without any Con@@ duc@@ tor .
&quot; to use this , however , some conditions must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to have a online ticket - what already do the most passengers do already .
&quot; you also have to purchase it via the app of the railway , the DB navig@@ ator , which is anyway the easiest type of ticket booking . &quot;
and finally you need a seating reservation .
&quot; for the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works : one climb@@ s into the train , calls its ticket under &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the test customer will then appear a button on electronic withdraw@@ als .
the guides get on their mobile devices a message that the g@@ ast X is located in the train and is taken to the booked seat Y .
comes the tractor companion in the driver check in place Y know he knows that there is a passenger with already un@@ worth@@ less online ticket .
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the train - what in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; those who want to relax without a ticket control through our train staff , ch@@ ased in the DB navig@@ ator just yourself . &quot;
&quot; this enables the passengers to create their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing @-@ Board of DB remot@@ ely . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often drives the railway , know that besides delays and missed the check@@ box , the check@@ box are among the biggest hass@@ les . &quot;
&quot; for many times you have in any case , but one of the fellow travellers do not have all the documents that you need to de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either if the credit card or the customer credit card , or otherwise a document is necessary . &quot;
&quot; the result are endless discussions between mig@@ rat@@ ers and bicycles , which leads to poor mood in the section or wholesale and delays in the control of your own tickets and the Con@@ duc@@ tor at the end the time takes to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and also only at the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further access numbers on the same track are not yet activated .
how an activ@@ ist got to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to their core .
&quot; only one day after having arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis Geb@@ al on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a mail from someone out of high school .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and there is still on the street , &quot; says it there . &quot;
&quot; confused , because nobody had posted the information on their Fe@@ ed , closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the hand@@ le @ the@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly delivered on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the Rap@@ per from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officers in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed , live to twe@@ ets . &quot;
he posted a picture of black@@ smith &apos;s body that was stretched on the road and stay there for four hours .
&quot; that is wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel thought . &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she placed her cell phone to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ ets via humans at the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos from the police band and people , the cri@@ ed , and by a man who said to be a sign with the writing : &quot; Fer@@ g@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they watched a live @-@ fe@@ ed where a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a rebel@@ li@@ ous dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , conf@@ essed a different polic@@ eman his gun and crying : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; rec@@ alled Fer@@ rell at her statement . &quot;
that is not the kind of murder that we used to acc@@ ust@@ omed to and which we can name typical .
in that moment I felt sho@@ ok .
&quot; I was angry , crying . &quot;
you booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock they took her 6 @-@ year old daughter from the house of her father , and decided that the two would go to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the movie theaters from 11 years . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and the Protest@@ ant , the love and loss of strength , strength and resistance , which consists of the point of view of the people living in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; in general with her daughter who contributed a flower @-@ dress and a suitable crown to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you , when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; reminded them what she said . &quot;
&quot; we are now going to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take it , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
you have to know and take it and be raised in it .
&quot; it needs to be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also know the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have luck to give her an experience in which she personally experienced no bl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would prove her a bad service to keep them away . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was invited to a camp as the activ@@ ist on the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
there were Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local owner who made lunch .
they prepared po@@ ckets in front of and helped to pass them on prot@@ esters .
slowly began a new type of activ@@ ism for fer@@ vent shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed after 9 August , &quot; &quot; she said and notices that she was president of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ urses Association and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell arrived during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , her and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r@@ ar wanted only &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question asked Fer@@ rell in the meaning : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can utilize ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by wh@@ ites - in a community that benef@@ ited by her pain and her resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field , which is known for its activ@@ ism around deaths . &quot;
his commitment brought the project closer to the project together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years to Bro@@ wns shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us . we speak , &quot; &quot; Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people will be represented , because so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ells experience - to show that it comes with the movement &quot; not to a m@@ essi@@ ah @-@ leader , but a communion , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; consequently , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show documents from &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; a surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ an &apos;s life , as she loves himself and her wife mar@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rel and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the in@@ humanity of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ells have history the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ purple Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as sul@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must carry the main load of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; the movement is really kept alive by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it is obvious that &quot; this is not a affirm@@ ative type of action , in general , due to their identity as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sho@@ ok her energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not acci@@ dental , though it was on the front front , because with a life at these crosses than a black , gay woman is as much at stake . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the news cameras arrived in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on have long gone , but the racial links between the municipality and the police have continued . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is at currency for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ ade of a highway in a demonstration .
it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she cl@@ ing to a song and she feels committed to this memory , since she went over three years ago in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; Wi@@ w@@ ahn &quot; : TV @-@ reader discuss about bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves the people though they are not built for a long time .
&quot; but the idea of a shopping centre on the south @-@ east of the pedestrian zone divi@@ des since the first presentation 2009 , the population in advocates and opponents . &quot;
cold makes the issue hardly anything .
also on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; will be discussed .
&quot; during the one bit of the bit @-@ gallery : &quot; this would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; That would be real &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side , &quot; &quot; does not need a man &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ adding ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the pro@@ pon@@ ents re@@ construct that a gallery draws more customers into the city , of which the rest of the stores will benefit , fear the pedestrian prec@@ inct . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery will be set exactly on the property , on which the farm market hall stands , in the 13 direct market positions . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the construction works , it will be at the end . &quot;
&quot; the Gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a mark@@ eth@@ all into the new building , namely the Bed@@ a place with possibility of sitting outside . &quot;
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been selling almost weekly in the farmhouses market for many years now .
&quot; mostly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the Land@@ fr@@ auen always very happy . &quot;
even the but@@ cher we have discovered for us too .
&quot; we would like to have a chance to maintain this offer during and especially after the construction of the gallery . &quot;
in other cities there is also this .
&quot; in particular , the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; &quot; whether director mer@@ ged in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the amount of rent . &quot;
&quot; however , it may not be low at the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what shopping @-@ branches in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; clothes , shoes , dr@@ yers or supermarkets : I find that super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
there is already enough in our city .
&quot; one sees however , how many stores here are empty here - some for months and years . &quot;
&quot; but here there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that we at least maintain the market hall . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered are fresh , mostly directly from the producer and is very inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , store stores in a shopping sc@@ enter only from larger companies , because the local ten@@ ants are often not portable for a ret@@ ailer . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special stores are almost no longer and what still exists , will probably still disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a mall with a market hall is not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where should the farmhouses market during the building period ?
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in time , if the bit gallery will actually come . &quot;
&quot; or does it already create the Ges@@ pen@@ st bit @-@ gallery before , all business transactions made from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it will simply not work .
&quot; a shopping center , which is empty , needs no one . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to make a real farm market instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farm market hall , yes , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - sensu@@ ous construction projects in Bit@@ burg is no place more . &quot;
&quot; when the farmhouses was broken , another piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
an appropriate simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown that are almost in@@ compar@@ ably similar - those on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist in He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ z from w@@ angen @-@ Tup@@ ppers and hair@@ cuts that were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence service analy@@ zer after they made a 35 @-@ year arrest warran@@ tee after they made a secret diplomatic reports on the website Wiki@@ Le@@ aks publicly . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2nd , is called A Bec@@ oming res@@ embl@@ ance ( An appropriate simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; it is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ z , whose discipline was converted to their expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and cre@@ ing , a Trans@@ wife and pioneering Dis@@ si@@ sts whose condem@@ nation from Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorithms , which was extrac@@ ted by Mann@@ ing , and out of 30 portraits , such as someone can be interpreted by these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways , as they can be interpreted and the in@@ dur@@ ated determin@@ ants of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already talked openly about the identification as a woman in 2013 , including six violations against the Spi@@ on@@ ag@@ eg@@ es@@ etz , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; due to the prison you have been suppres@@ sed by the picture , so much that there was only one photo - a bas@@ ins , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in the Mann@@ ing can obviously sit uncomfortable on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ in@@ bl@@ onde per@@ ch has been associated with which she was also associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of their 2012 project &quot; stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; therein , the artist produced in portraits of foreigners from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette mu@@ te and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um , by making the DNA from the waste to establish a picture of how these people might look . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a period of year .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press conference in the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she was not visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so she took contact with Chelsea and asked whether she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist , and their det@@ ain@@ ted M@@ use were reported to un@@ equal correc@@ tions , which were inter@@ viewed in the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created one of the Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated com@@ ic &quot; &quot; Supp@@ res@@ sed Images &quot; , who would fores@@ ee a future in which the president Chel@@ y@@ iel@@ ding judgment would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing release after seven brutal years had been calling in a military prison in K@@ ansas , was a welcome sort of bl@@ iss@@ al meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something low and star@@ kes , since Donald Tru@@ mp introduces a war against inform@@ ants from the government &apos;s camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to fix the rigi@@ d divisions , which he actually should fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ z was asked after the strange Tim@@ ing of all these things , she said that &quot; &quot; things from a certain reason happen . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the gallery &apos;s written artistic statement called Mann@@ ing with her super@@ big signature , among them ( the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end to the automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation sex , race , sexuality and culture have been . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousands of c@@ s and GS and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed , showing the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nuclear en@@ o@@ ids after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist , as amazing , at least in biological respects , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully bring about them is that our gen@@ ome is not about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell as many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room is a page from the above mentioned Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle . &quot;
it shows Mann@@ ing how they appeared with a freel@@ ancer in the hand of the discipl@@ ined bar@@ racks of the United States such as King @-@ Kong .
&quot; if they face your speech , then they have won &quot; , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote me , &quot; &quot; said the artist who sal@@ ute from Philadelphia . &quot;
I &apos;m still getting go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it should be fores@@ een in the com@@ ic book - but if they should do it , it will be welcomed in the center of the room by the masks , who mer@@ ged from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulation . &quot;
&quot; it was also oriented , as it was all written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ log@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel that they feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ z from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that feels like Chelsea , like the movement , which is also hidden behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and a employee of the University of Oxford because of killing
a nation@@ wide crowd hunting is in progress for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford who were looking for a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries .
&quot; on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ t because of their alleged participation in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the author of the Cook County show . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died . &quot;
&quot; one of the police authority of Chicago published war@@ ded War@@ n@@ system , that the Lei@@ che was discovered on 27 July . &quot;
&quot; officials received a call , came to Grand Plaza Apartments and found the sacrifice with several injury to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au is still declared on the place of action for dead , and det@@ ective investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively searches for the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
La@@ them has been an extraordinary Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University in 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that La@@ them were now in be@@ amed and excluded from the subject of the Campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal issue that is investigated by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University collaborate with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is a Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man from the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail explanation that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help the U.S. authorities in every conceivable way . &quot;
&quot; the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want , that he turned himself . &quot;
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said he urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police has an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the Building Manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip that said in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as a very cruel one .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security sk@@ am@@ eras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline and the background of the sacrifice and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada timetable in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vi@@ enc@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
&quot; the Russian Vi@@ enc@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said , I will not last long before the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) . &quot;
&quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ USA@@ DA has received the right in cooperation with Ukrain ( UK anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ ada map was updated in this regard , &quot; declared Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of the W@@ ada to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the re @-@ setting of R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he contains nothing that could cause an occasion for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results are presented to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and the W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list stated , however , that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities reported the reported results of the W@@ ada approved investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly accept government approved D@@ op@@ ings in Russian sports . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko : &quot; we perform the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has an error . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there was no state of state of state , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos Wor@@ b related to those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing Commission . &quot;
&quot; talking to the Russian sales point of sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report is controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report uncondi@@ tionally , &quot; he added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ als from the W@@ ada of the implementation of D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls in Russia .
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after visiting the captain of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ General @-@ General Manager Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ USA@@ DA moved &quot; in the right direction . &quot; &quot;
Al@@ di sold no eggs any more
this shared the company groups .
&quot; it is a mere precau@@ tionary measure , it could continue to be assumed by no health impair@@ ment , it was published in the press release . &quot;
&quot; from now , only eggs are likely to be delivered to Al@@ di , that have been tested negative on fi@@ pr@@ on@@ il@@ ant anti @-@ gaps . &quot;
the Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency in his customers .
the start @-@ ups which will help your organization not to become the next uten@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the happiness at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you spoke anonym@@ ity , some workers are not in the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce H@@ air Care Society Madison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it was created by the outside world by means of help .
a new breed of human resources start @-@ ups is on w@@ ax@@ ing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing of software that allows the specific purpose of measuring the employees , it allows companies to conduct surveys , speci@@ ality and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wer@@ n to handle the C @-@ Suite executives and turn right at the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Str@@ ava and Fit@@ Bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; , Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools is used to measure employees . &quot;
salvation said that they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys by certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows on a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives may have low popularity results - so you can re@@ sti@@ r why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to find that at the head of the workplace culture you need to stay , so that you have not been involved in Sk@@ and@@ ale , who has since been published a blog post office who spoke to an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment , in which those who have spoken , pun@@ ished . &quot;
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t this desire is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
&quot; the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance Industry could be more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion , according to the financial technical website Let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent has tailor @-@ made &quot; powder &quot; surveys , confidential answers in real time and view the warmth of your problem areas . &quot;
it also provides an anonymous SMS @-@ hot@@ line with the employee can report a real behaviour .
&quot; and when the main business guide is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the Reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that his employees is treated poor@@ ly , or un@@ ethical , it can experience cost @-@ time consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , workers @-@ flu@@ ids and charges , &quot; said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , Con@@ ver@@ cent has been used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their company central . &quot;
&quot; earlier if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to submit a telephone number or email for the corporate headquarters to submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said , there was no good opportunity to trace the complaints from employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company Con@@ ver@@ cent uses , can cause problems that were previously hidden from leaders , which were hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or intoler@@ able internship can be identified and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; company started to take ethics , values and employees in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen coll@@ ap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the endo@@ ron sc@@ andal , &quot; said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; Social Media rightly came to their right , &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology for monitoring the ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent provide your software as a service , and charge the company with recur@@ rent fees for the use of their products . &quot;
&quot; it is a business model and a chance that will support the consent of Venture Capital investors , which both start @-@ ups . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sap@@ ph@@ ire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , which has raised the entire capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itz@@ ers insured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , and brought all its financing to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; this investment will hardly be surprising , in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s staff can expect more from their jobs than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Sili@@ con Valley , high points and interesting projects are only in@@ serts . &quot;
staff want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you can give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are glad to be in a company , feel their voices , and that the work they do is worthwhile , then they feel stronger obliged to make this company successfully , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Employ@@ ee Experience on Link@@ ed@@ In , who is both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; investors can reach Rend@@ sburg , if its portfolio is running well . companies run good when employees are campa@@ ign@@ ing and engaged . &quot;
&quot; when the analytics tools do not promise to enhance commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on the employees of the workplace @-@ culture is important .
&quot; however , the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a business is not taking action . &quot;
&quot; in fact , if a company asks people after your feedback , it can have a expectation that change on the path . &quot;
&quot; and if the changes do not come quickly enough , or not at all , this dis@@ appointments can cultiv@@ ate and bear@@ able . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to have been willing to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , the company who has seen too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow employees , &quot; &quot; Have you really heard ? &quot;
take care of it ?
and whom you don &apos;t worry about why should I ?
&quot; Madison Re@@ ed , who carries out monthly surveys that now has monthly surveys , was able to invite action on the same day when a problem above g@@ lin@@ t is reported so deli@@ ver@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organise the decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , capable of organising several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; in Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new insights on staff , and hopes that in the long term , this leads to a better bond of workers in a sector which is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customer , then you will lose company . &quot;
N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood
it goes to 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers are talking on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on the campus .
some have moved their tri@@ c@@ oto@@ graphy and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of the training manager .
for a good part of the team these unt@@ ary minutes represent a lunch break .
&quot; players who are log@@ ged into the summer @-@ courses , will return after the three @-@ hour exercise , before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 to the Aqu@@ man football Center . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s for the guys the next three days a real Tre@@ t@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and she actually extends her days - at least until the finale on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to meet the already completed time plans of the player . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than one day , at which the brood moved almost a week after the last season , and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six game times in western and practical exercises . &quot;
&quot; in the course of August 18 exercises , you should ab@@ ide over the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he support the control of the N@@ CA@@ A suppor@@ ter , even if they add the multiple routes of the player to another point . &quot;
&quot; we put this tremendous load three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it , they plac@@ ken further , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it really is great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end their practices as soon as the camp is finished , which was in view of the clear si@@ lic@@ tions of its fields from an adjacent parking area and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already pl@@ ough@@ ed a protective network behind a tor@@ p@@ fo@@ sten , no easy task . &quot;
&quot; brood @-@ players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a dre@@ amed that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then set aside an exercise . &quot;
if you have the video and from one exercise it is quite good business .
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I do not want to worry about that too .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against f@@ eit news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with folding feed@@ backs of third parties and show its results under the original contribution , then the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called f@@ ake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on his website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine methods to identify possible mis@@ responses and to send them to Fak@@ uma @-@ check that may display outcomes by the fact check out of the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main points for so @-@ called F@@ ake news , many of whom have also influenced the U.S. presidential election in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , whereby French voters were floo@@ ded ahead of the presidential elections in May with false stories , and Germany should not succeed in eradi@@ c@@ ating h@@ asser@@ tive post@@ ings as before the elections there in September quickly . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate explanation in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of new facts review . &quot;
&quot; in addition to finding out what stories of fact @-@ pro@@ hibition parties want to be challenged , people want more context to make well @-@ founded decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; Sara Su , Product man@@ ag@@ ger for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;
she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; in connection &quot; and works on other changes to his News Fe@@ ed to reduce false news .
creating a com@@ ic spot : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the small Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 @-@ er and 1980 @-@ he was a fl@@ ap .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years turbul@@ ent history of its cosy seat in the Ar@@ l River valley in K@@ ent and is now inspiration for an graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says awake . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos;s thri@@ lling the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that illustrated in Scot@@ ney - Isaac L@@ enk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book by Rhodes , that is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected emotional . &quot;
&quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ bs on the side of a letter , which was written by a double @-@ month in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thum@@ bs ! &quot;
&quot; and letters are always cra@@ wl , because back then one lit a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he was too . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is so with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have to be a little over@@ rated , &quot; ) all seem too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rhodes spent his days to explore the Vic@@ t@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , like about the mon@@ o@@ ed hy@@ ena holes in the walls and the bottles , the centuries had spent in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landsc@@ ap@@ ors , gardening and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and started to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust was first received in 2006 as the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; as a Rhodes a decade later , the staff began to take care of the archive that he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ ocr@@ ats said &quot; &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; sli@@ des@@ hows , letters from the time of the English Emp@@ ires , maps that represent what poss@@ essed : &quot; you might mean that country conflict would be boring , &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a pe@@ ar to have fought two families . &quot;
guys , let everything go his gang ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man who for@@ ged the newly built castle to join the farm rose from 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il , the 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; K@@ night@@ ly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rhodes . &quot;
the farm began in this area and I thought it was a good beginning .
perhaps are the two inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who told the history of the Jes@@ u@@ it , who hidden the family of Dar@@ rell seven years throughout the re@@ formation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , shown in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell was presented from the 18th century , who filled his own funeral with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite an cro@@ oks , getting some debt and spend money for things that they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men prov@@ oked their debt crises , by having rich old women married - I imagine they found myself as a bunch of well @-@ seeing guys before , with a talent to advertise . &quot;
after the end of his efforts at the castle Rhodes is searching for other unique writing experiences
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a Com@@ ic @-@ Roman over El@@ mar@@ sh@@ re@@ ws , the terrain of a san@@ at@@ orio from the early 20th century , which has since been restored by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Oh , now I must finish up with the dam@@ n life again . &quot;
campaign launched : more than 300 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the envel@@ oping of the 301 year old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef has launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella @-@ brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) . &quot;
even until Thursday Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team wish to keep the logo and the slogan .
at the end of August it will be the highlight of the campaign on the island of Graf@@ en@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ en@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; &quot; write them on their yesterday un@@ locked website . &quot;
but we use this measure to gain your attention .
&quot; and to make it clear , that man@@ ches is better than it seems . &quot;
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we as a bath Hon@@ orary citizen to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; the action makes it more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , is it further . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate an all@@ est promise , one that gives the city an un@@ mistak@@ able thing . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in the competition with other municipalities . &quot;
a middle five @-@ dig@@ it amount will be the city of Bad Honnef its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan fear of the army
each year in early August advis@@ es in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) via pen@@ sion@@ ists and subsidies in the officer sector .
so also this week .
at first sight a regular procedure .
&quot; but nothing is routine against the Turkish armed forces , a year after the coup . &quot;
&quot; the meeting did not take place in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the prime minister of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; in the proceedings , under the presidency of the government now also took the five recipes , as well as the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , justice and foreign affairs . &quot;
&quot; thus , the civilians were in the Y@@ as in the survi@@ vor@@ s . &quot;
the government moves the military to the military .
&quot; Director Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , of air forces and the nav@@ y were put down . &quot;
&quot; since the failed cou@@ p , President Erdo@@ gan 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als has been folded . &quot;
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged ties to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len to the Erdo@@ gan as the wire @-@ wire of the coup .
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people , who were directly involved in the coup attempt , is being negotiated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup Erdo@@ gan now designated the overthrow of a &quot; &quot; divine gift &quot; , &quot; as he give him the opportunity to puri@@ fy the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan the army really under control ?
&quot; in the end of February the newspaper &quot; Hürriyet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ eas@@ iness in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
&quot; in the General Staff , there are concerns over an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which manifes@@ ts itself among other things in the abolition of the head ban for sol@@ dat@@ ements , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the grand@@ mothers on the army and the security guards goes on in any case .
&quot; in the middle of July Erdo@@ gan by decre@@ e further 73@@ 95 state serving dam@@ p , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 54@@ 6 soldiers . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it seemed that Erdo@@ gan was t@@ amed of the military . &quot;
the gener@@ als presented earlier than the actual men of the country .
three times put@@ rid her under appeal to their role as guar@@ di@@ ans of the world@@ ly state order .
&quot; after his election of 2002 , Erdo@@ gan &apos;s power had taken step by step , not least in appeal to the reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan &apos;s targeted targeted by Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; V@@ oc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; a particular not so @-@ called officer who sought after the coup attempt out of fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; in a few years . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such development could not be cold . &quot;
&quot; anyway , in the alliance , there is no doubt concerning the use of the Turkish army in the alliance . &quot;
&quot; the management structures and operational abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , &quot; said President Donald Tru@@ mp , c@@ ited by the media . &quot;
&quot; it looks ahead of lowering the legal immigrants in 50,000 per year , more str@@ ingent regulations for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary employment permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty reduction , wages and billions dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by changing the way the citizens from other countries of Green Cards will be presented . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will come to candidates who have the financial resources to assist themselves and show knowledge that are coming to our economy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , c@@ ited by the American media . &quot;
ministry will extend route for racing
&quot; over the past few months later , over the future of the race increases sh@@ utt@@ les - now it is supposed to go very quickly . &quot;
&quot; still before the end of the year , at the mar@@ gins distance , on which the tourist train drives , will be built . &quot;
&quot; to secure the future of the race for sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , according to statements of the Department of Commerce , this year , construction work will begin on the track . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order to order the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g to order and to san@@ ate , the country has led to this especially for tourism important communication , &quot; stated road @-@ State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost of maintenance of the track is reduced to about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country is over 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the Treaty , on whose basis the shuttle should also be ordered from the country in the future , I will finally be coordinated , explained S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen Bahn as a operator are already agreed upon the technical details .
&quot; this means the timetable which used vehicles and quality standards , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway society will be closed for a long period of eleven years .
to be ordered the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle to be ordered on December 2017 .
the racing bike shuttle is particularly popular with tourists popular railway connection between the stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; over the past few months , during the course of a pilot project had been tested , whether the route is used by many people to order to reg@@ ain them again in the future . &quot;
the track is also divided in parts strongly .
the rise of sex robot is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it may not be more crazy , a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robot . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex @-@ robots are at the moment a great thing .
&quot; recently published the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) , a report on the development of sex robot in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ti@@ fied Professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take their rise seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye @-@ color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el . &quot;
&quot; people make yourself funny , but the company deliver lots of it and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; Mr Shar@@ key said at the publication of his new report . &quot;
&quot; modern sex doll@@ s have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a si@@ lic@@ on , which feels warm , with conscious human responses , which can be achieved through artificial intelligence . &quot;
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs &quot; &quot; and choose everything from the eye @-@ color of the robot about the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples up to the type or the color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it is still disturbing , since many robots have the &quot; characters &quot; that would be a st@@ eppe @-@ wife progressive . &quot;
modern Sex@@ es have evolved to robots with a si@@ lic@@ on .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x @-@ robot allows for example to suit its users , their robots to the characteristics that they find appealing , such as Schü@@ tern@@ ess . &quot;
and then there is still the True Comp@@ ani@@ on developed Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robots with pre @-@ programmed personalities as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; which gives the impression of students and &quot; Wild Wendy &quot; with a &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; &quot; black@@ ened the website of True Comp@@ ani@@ on . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she may not like what you do not like , etc . &quot;
in the course of the day her m@@ oods - quite like real people !
they can be tired of fixed on conversation or can be &quot; in the mood . &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects of this up@@ lifting of sex robot - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ li@@ ous female characteristics , the an@@ alogue to rape , if one is a step on rape , if one is a step on rape as one ( here : contradic@@ tory ) Far@@ rah is a most disturbing one on the most . &quot;
on his website True Comp@@ ani@@ on Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a Vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibration , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not only a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex tool . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and its increasing refin@@ ement show a little dar@@ ker and deeper into our culture , to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course keep no sex robot , and while the FR@@ R notices its rising popularity , they still remain provisional at the edge of the consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what can be wi@@ dened from the edge @-@ zones , can be in terms of the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
and many people are not wei@@ rd or offensive until they use the free market for permission .
&quot; there is however a certain l@@ edge that these highly evolved sex robots are threatened in a time when the rights of women are threatened globally , in which there is a president in the White House which has lo@@ wered women sexually . &quot;
&quot; the most horrible aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the dev@@ oti@@ ves body and the stolen eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the target behind these sex robot is to establish a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also using porno@@ star proportions ) .
&quot; their buil@@ ders want they feel human , that they will im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot;
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not a real women . &quot;
you can not separate from her companion or simply leave .
&quot; they have no placement or a background history , nothing , which could inter@@ fere on independence or anything that could inter@@ rupt the fantasy of total submission . &quot;
otherwise expressed : you are frau@@ dul@@ ent slaves .
or to express it in the Rede@@ emer of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tru@@ mp@@ s big performance ?
he does Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the term of the healthy sense of life
&quot; it has become a Bin@@ ding of the Tru@@ mp era that has pol@@ arized the political divisions , which have pol@@ arized the US @-@ elect@@ ors , also families in small format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ fest , there were newspapers with advice on how to cope with the horror of Tru@@ mp @-@ finished relatives . &quot;
we all alleg@@ edly distr@@ acted to all of our filters .
&quot; less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s , bringing families together . &quot;
&quot; I mention this , because my cous@@ ine , a left @-@ focused seals that lives in Chicago and has long been dealing with the republi@@ cans in our family , who visited this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House everybody knows that she knows , including the Republi@@ can relationship with which she fought for decades due to politics , suddenly and quite peculi@@ ar on the same side . &quot;
&quot; to the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it also falls me in a further context that this will also bring significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the final effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; if we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gr@@ ati@@ ful possibility that the kitt@@ ens of a day can no longer be dismant@@ led . &quot;
&quot; but there is still a long @-@ time long @-@ time scenario , in which Tru@@ mp Republi@@ cans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; , &quot; which suddenly appeared in comparison with his standards as an in@@ dem@@ ise of denial . &quot;
&quot; I find myself today from an active no@@ stalgia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s un@@ com@@ ic version of the hiding place - the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ach , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return ) - both compared to Tru@@ mp in fact a very mild crime . &quot;
&quot; if Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only be mentally healthy to qualify as in@@ estim@@ able improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cous@@ in was in town , we brought our children to the carousel of Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ells of the New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you need no caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fiber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all C@@ low@@ ns are scar@@ ce and the animals revol@@ ve to look full of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the clim@@ atic music conv@@ eys this in a notable manner . &quot;
&quot; so many stere@@ otypes of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are becoming familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city does not meet the dream . &quot;
&quot; five years later , and I &apos;m still not across the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage - the them@@ ed pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; central Park @-@ carousel is still a strange magical experience , as here two two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could evaluate the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked them afterwards . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; &quot; experience &quot; &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before using my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my road it is the same , plus the option to get the rating with a 15 % drinking water - this to buy something over the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to a slow@@ ing of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also exercises pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ ze , while I have tired the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Ch@@ ori@@ us with breast pain from the prison to the hospital
&quot; Pist@@ ar@@ hus has left the prison for a hospital visit , for the second time . &quot;
&quot; last year he was transferred to the hospital because of the treatment of be@@ aks in his hand , which he suffered from the pr@@ isons , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ ar@@ us was condemned to a first blow to prosec@@ ut@@ ors , because of murder after an appeal of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors . &quot;
he t@@ öt@@ tle Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of St. Valent@@ ine 2013 by placing them several times through a door of the toil@@ ett@@ enk@@ ab@@ ine in his house in Pre@@ tor@@ ia .
&quot; Pist@@ ar@@ us said that he held his girlfriend for a night@@ mare in@@ tru@@ der , who hid himself in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ar@@ oos App@@ liance , from which they say it is too l@@ sight@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the national enforcement agency said that they will rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the claim can be heard this year . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ ar@@ oos runs risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years , when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors will be successful . &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold a strange egg finds
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the neighborhoods of Prot@@ ect and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen was released into the holidays and the leading schools . &quot;
three of the det@@ ectors are in future for the gram@@ mar school , four on the Real@@ school . &quot;
&quot; Schul@@ te Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te greeted in the office evening , the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen . &quot;
&quot; elected as a symbol for school leaving the 29 students of four classes under the direction of Sophia Schum@@ acher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des a young eag@@ le who grows in the chicken , but then release into freedom . &quot;
&quot; this led the m@@ under@@ e Sch@@ ar a musical with the title &quot; &quot; The eag@@ le in the chickens &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and made it out of his h@@ ens . &quot;
instead of a chicken cor@@ k came a small eag@@ le out .
&quot; but the hope of making him a chicken , sm@@ ashed the eag@@ le spread out on a high mountain and escaped his wings . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank a chicken . &quot;
&quot; the chicken danced with the young go@@ ck@@ les , the cylin@@ ders , to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Eagle stands for the integration , said Schul@@ te Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the young is indeed different from the other young animals ( chic@@ ks ) , but they belong to it . &quot;
he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
they wish every single bed @-@ äss@@ ler that he feels accepted in his new school .
&quot; he was followed by the colleagues to the colleagues , the former school leader Michael Müller , who has always jumping again in teaching , and the parent &apos;s family members . &quot;
the chic@@ ory is now over , explained school teachers Sophia Schum@@ acher . &quot;
&quot; they leave their students after two years of teaching only , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the grades . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students enjoy a song of summer time and holiday season . &quot;
this was great joy in the children .
for the new year @-@ year eight initial bre@@ eder are already registered .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal camp@@ ings in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , c@@ ited by television . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of the 1st August there was a group of illegal people in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
on the same day they were released while currently a study runs .
&quot; the State Department reported b@@ TV , that the Bulg@@ arians were later released . &quot;
&quot; Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated control of the free camp@@ uses and place everyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose to have considerable monetary policy . &quot;
the controls will continue throughout the season .
the ministry told that the court can impose a sentence .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the people affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to take part in the action ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software updates are offered for a total of approximately 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they are intended to improve the gas behaviour of cars of emissions from Euro 5 and partially in some euros 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in by ACE Auto Club Europe gives the estimates :
is the new action compul@@ sory ?
&quot; no , the tr@@ aded software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the compul@@ sory updates previously only apply to the cars , the Schum@@ an software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the retro@@ fit has arranged the power system ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers keep informed about updates ?
&quot; the makers have announced a rapid implementation in the next months , but it is still not known as an appointment . &quot;
Daim@@ ler has communicated to any person affected .
&quot; if there is already an inspection , it will be done in their framework . &quot;
how long is the circum@@ stance taken down together ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the attachments depend on the engagement of the manufacturers as well as political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen , voluntarily act the car manufacturers on the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long will the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be an appointment .
&quot; what does motor@@ ists do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE tra@@ itor to wait .
presum@@ ably foreign manufacturers would carry out such a met@@ an@@ in .

the ACE feared that .
&quot; but even in the regions , where the ban is dro@@ pping . &quot;
in rural areas there has so far no securities for older diesel .

ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the gl@@ am@@ orous events in Washington .
&quot; the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises , political to become political . &quot;
one of the winners will not come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets as first rap@@ per as one of the cov@@ eted hon@@ ors of the renowned Kennedy Center .
&quot; in this year , Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreo@@ grapher Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV @-@ producer Norman LE@@ AR ( 95 ) . &quot;
the awards at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , US @-@ President Donald Tru@@ mp will hold a reception and participate with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;
the winner of the progressive TV series is announced by the LE@@ AR Award that is why they already announced to the participation in the g@@ ala .
&quot; the &quot; New York Times &quot; said : &quot; &quot; this presidency has decided to negl@@ ect the Arts and Human Rights - even the means of depri@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year Est@@ ef@@ an said , she will use the conversation with Tru@@ mp to impose their point of view . &quot;
the former president John F. Kennedy @-@ Kennedy @-@ Centre is the largest setting in the U.S. capital .
&quot; the former winners are Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city alive
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to R@@ ente next year . &quot;
&quot; however , the location is already written - suitable applicants are however r@@ ar . &quot;
since 31 years is W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work is still great fun as he conv@@ eys in the press .
&quot; he reports of diversi@@ fied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , I wonder@@ ed that so far there is no application for requirements . &quot;
the city seeks a architects or engineer for the next time .
&quot; thus , - taking in attention of the regular dism@@ iss@@ al fri@@ ction - still enough time for a job . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ l@@ ach also acts for the administrative community as a sub@@ ordin@@ ance body , the applicant must prove appropriate degrees . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
&quot; if they do not fill them any more , the citizens would have to drive to consultation up to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but the proximity to the city and himself is important , says W@@ acker , who reported by a good working atmosphere , as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in the office more than 30 years , some significant projects have collected to look back with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city alive , &quot; he is sure about the building office and its employees . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as , and of the low @-@ level park . &quot;
the se@@ ven@@ brücke between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed even the stadium is still subject .
&quot; the latter alone will strike with around 1.5 million euros with be@@ ech , &quot; &quot; if we really do it &quot; , &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; all in all are great tasks waiting for my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
gest@@ ed be there for a Stadt@@ bau@@ master great room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building and gar@@ dener could be quite flexible to react .
&quot; it can move a lot &quot; , &quot; so w@@ acker , and the design of the si@@ ves will often be mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; since the old city as ensemble stands under monument protection , it is important to have an eye to have what rein@@ car@@ ts &quot; &quot; when new builds to be approved , stresses the pen@@ den@@ ing Stadt@@ bau@@ master . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ masters carries high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is Bau@@ herr , &quot; in the end everything is running here about my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( high @-@ construction ) has been here since ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( underground ) has been for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor remains long , wishes &quot; W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good operation , but also for the further formation of the city . &quot;
&quot; who would like to be@@ et Roland W@@ acker , after information from Has@@ l@@ ach , a student &apos;s degree as a diplom@@ engineer or Bachelor &apos;s degree can have a good knowledge in the fields of construction and construction projects . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt are high @-@ and low @-@ construction , construction planning , gra@@ de@@ mining matters , administration of urban loung@@ es , city center with building and city gar@@ den@@ ers as well as under@@ mining agencies , including monument protection . &quot;
bicycle on lines cast : south @-@ track locked
&quot; according to the police , the blue @-@ known offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway @-@ railway station in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) . &quot;
these were so badly damaged that the her@@ edit@@ ary freight train had to be hal@@ ted .
investig@@ ators go out of two male boards and search for them for the night hours .
near the scene we have been observed by witnesses a ros@@ ary sco@@ oter and a bike riders .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ d , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ Spe@@ ech Christoph Pos@@ ch for APA . &quot;
the perpet@@ rators brought itself into great danger and also the train traffic would have endangered .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the system and the delay &quot; &quot; walk &quot; &quot; and the cost of rail transport may also come back to the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; overall , be done by a &quot; significant &quot; sum , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
&quot; the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south ground track could be led without disability . &quot;
&quot; almost ten persons of persons were dropped on a Friday afternoon , two of them are served . &quot;
&quot; Gü@@ ter@@ ies were not falling out , but they had a delay . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced around 200 metres above .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help , IB@@ D ( inflammation of the intest@@ ine ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your diges@@ tive system like a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , might be the symptoms of patients with inflammatory performers . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able state , which in the US affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 30@@ 0.000 , causes Mag@@ en@@ kr@@ ap@@ ors and Bl@@ acks , recur@@ rent or bloody break@@ down , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; during those affected normally , meat and dairy products are likely to avoid their symptoms , researchers found at the Washing@@ toner University that helps develop an essential amino acid Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins to contribute to the toler@@ ant intestinal cells . &quot;
&quot; the conduc@@ tive researchers , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the intest@@ ine said to ensure that dam@@ aging micro@@ bes , that hide themselves in the food , not penet@@ rate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells , who are able to dis@@ solve inflammation , become balanced by cells that protect tolerance and protect the body , without in@@ sensitive tissues . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in a inflammatory cause . &quot;
&quot; in experiments , it was established that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cells occurs with mice , which carry out a particular bacter@@ ium in their unity . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the elements of proteins to dis@@ solve the appearance of cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ ine micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an ag@@ ro@@ top@@ han @-@ rich diet toler@@ ant , less inflammatory , less inflammatory , if the same system also wir@@ es with people . &quot;
&quot; the Post@@ do@@ kt@@ or@@ and@@ in Dr. Luisa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an under@@ went a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when she found out that a group of sp@@ ells such cells had , but another group of the same tribe but had not yet had . &quot;
&quot; it suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ oma had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and mushrooms , which usually live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
the intest@@ ines of the mice were found DNA sequ@@ entially and there were six species of bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells but without being l@@ acked with mice .
&quot; mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment so they failed to develop an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria tends to grow on the immune system , the researchers spent L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells that have been isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune @-@ cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; as the active component of the liquid was cle@@ ans@@ ed , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism that is known as an in@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the for@@ age of the mice , the number of such cells rose by around 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ de@@ ed levels were hal@@ ted , s@@ ank the number of cells around half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ ant con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve cells such as mice and that most of us are protecting L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tractors .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ adren@@ al products made by L. reu@@ ter@@ i the cells in people so develop as with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory performers . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , as these cells are inflammation towards the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ de@@ es can lead to a expansion of this population .
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes in Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot;
&quot; at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , &quot; believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut on Wednesday evening after S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pounds of Chelsea started with 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game , before the UEF@@ A Super Cup at Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impres@@ sing in the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira . &quot;
&quot; MAT@@ IC had been excluded from the preparation @-@ Asia tour of the blues and managed just 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him to be ready earlier than later .
besides M@@ atic we also started Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in Avi@@ va stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
&quot; the Independent revealed in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho showed three further new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic work &quot; , &quot; three of his four priority new commitments . &quot;
&quot; three of four get , thank you for the club , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they got four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US Air@@ manufacturer Boeing has the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky painted .
&quot; the pil@@ ots flew from Seattle in the US state Washington , the drawing began but in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved to the shape of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers via the US , which are several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the rad@@ ar terminals the shape of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole was a dis@@ continuous test for new engines .
Boeing had already done such advertising earlier .
&quot; thus , the number &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; and the Boeing @-@ logo was painted in the sky . &quot;
&quot; new envel@@ ope for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
but how the wind blo@@ ws : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel still SPD chef was at present social @-@ democratic prime minister before elections always with a certain concern of Berlin .
&quot; only no stur@@ geon of the party central , merely no counter @-@ wind from the covenant - so that the most important desire for the voting fighters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from the Willy Brandt @-@ House has been watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
&quot; what has been given from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described as an approach in the approach . &quot;
there were deep @-@ hits .
in one after another .
the Con@@ federation CD@@ U sees the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a generic signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Green .
&quot; this shows once more : red green can simply not be reliable , &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
the surprising frac@@ tion@@ of a Green Democr@@ at has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
&quot; five months before the elections , his red @-@ green coalition lost their red @-@ green coalition to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green @-@ Chief Executive Director Michael Kell@@ ner promp@@ ted the Ab@@ sen@@ sel@@ ess Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ sische Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ una to return their mandate .
the over@@ step to the CD@@ U means a clear understanding of the constitu@@ ency .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ una must immediately return her mandate , &quot; said the German business leader and campaigns of the Gre@@ ens network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; this may not all be true , &quot; &quot; sig@@ h an SPD @-@ electoral fighter , as on Friday afternoon the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message had reached the Party central . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Nieder@@ sachsen , stands after the over@@ head of the Green Members of El@@ ke T@@ una to the CD@@ U without own Regi@@ str@@ ation . &quot;
it is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD member associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland @-@ election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med down the comrades of his time . &quot;
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ West@@ p@@ hal@@ ia it will be everything different .
that was then - and it was all clearly worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the do@@ ve , the Düsseldorf @-@ side Haute the party s@@ lick . &quot;
lab@@ orious the comrades in the weeks later on .
then when they had just begun a new courage he came from the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg .
and with him the next down@@ side came .
&quot; Mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD governor , lost during the weekend his Nim@@ bus because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned . &quot;
and because he goes wrong in crisis communications so pretty all that you can make wrong .
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z fights for his political survival . &quot;
now even Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; due to the VW and its role in the Supervisory Board , the precip@@ itation @-@ Sax@@ on prime minister had already been in criticism for long term . &quot;
Mi@@ ese Re@@ quired were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely , Wei@@ l tried to put stronger in recent weeks more and stronger , in the Bund of Ak@@ z@@ ente . &quot;
&quot; the efforts of the former Citizens of Hanover , his power in Berlin remained un@@ hidden also comrades in the surroundings of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they let him grant him as they spoke of Wei@@ l to stabil@@ ise the party .
&quot; now , the exact opposite can occur . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l meets the party internal constraints , is basically no fault . &quot;
and Schulz certainly not .
sometimes the comrades try to keep their own ranks .
&quot; your wrath is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and in particular on the deport@@ ees of parliament@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic dictatorship , such as Ms T@@ una puts their own career eating on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , leader of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; Ms. T@@ una has not been elected because of her person as direct can@@ did@@ acy , but on the national list of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , leader of the SPD @-@ German parlam@@ entary group , lam@@ ents a &quot; non @-@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the elect@@ ors of four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l to the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ sische SPD to the German Bundestag in the Bundestag election , the R@@ N@@ D . &quot;
&quot; now we see the personal career of future CD@@ U members , the W@@ ah@@ er result , &quot; said op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called for clear the background .
I want to know whether there has been more or given it further promises of the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
delivery of the village III
&quot; who wants to be in the years met , can soon get support from the country . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of st@@ eg city development on Wednesday in delicate . &quot;
at the beginning of the information seminar Sch@@ in@@ dler gave back a review on the previously happening .
since 1991 it has been present in sensitive san@@ itation areas .
&quot; back then , in the refurb@@ ishment I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg was still taken over two thirds of the funding . &quot;
in the refurb@@ ishment II from 2005 to 2016 the allowance stays still 60 percent .
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler the previous s@@ ails are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is eventually important to promote the inner development , and not only to tap into new building areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , I have received the information from the Government on 4 April that there will be a refurb@@ ishment III . &quot;
&quot; amount to 833 333 euros , of which would be 500 000 euros of the country , the rest from the municipality . &quot;
how is a refurb@@ ishing area now ?
&quot; one will continue to examine as Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; truly old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but it also plays a role , whether in the planned field ever interest to guide . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the territory borders could then be postpon@@ ed again . &quot;
the pon@@ to@@ on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal states &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; , &quot; where the refurb@@ ishments would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alization of inter@@ iors , improving the living and employment relationships and the expansion of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would object to object , that is done per plot . &quot;
the refurb@@ ishment would eventually be fixed as stat@@ ute .
the completion period for funding runs from 1 January 2017 to 30 April 2026 .
&quot; however until September this year , however , the inventory was carried out only once , as part of those who wish to fill out a questionn@@ aire to a questionn@@ aire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the pun@@ ctu@@ ation of the stat@@ ute is scheduled to be started in the coming year with the refurb@@ ishments . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann , subsequently , that every Comm@@ une would perform the predicted in advance exam@@ inations . &quot;
&quot; it is about to evaluate and decide the city of ab@@ norm@@ alities , and to decide when sandy and to what extent . &quot;
there will also be a retro@@ fit in the book for the respective property .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come back again , and get a picture of the situation , she said . &quot;
Got@@ zel empha@@ sized an essential success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
&quot; therefore , it will give questionn@@ aires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; building and property ar@@ c , &quot; in which it is among other things about the building state and the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; household and housing ar@@ c , &quot; can be made information about size , division and residents of a residential area . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; Cap@@ ar@@ c &quot; &quot; is only to fill out if in the building business periods are operated . &quot;
&quot; however , to note that Got@@ zel pointed out that a filled questionn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new measures are not con@@ form@@ able . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler stressed that the distribution of funding according to the &quot; &quot; Wind@@ de@@ bian &quot; &quot; work - who comes first , mah@@ le first . &quot;
&quot; you could not reserve funding for &quot; &quot; later &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the conclusion , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Locations II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the presence of a refurb@@ ishment &quot; &quot; sav@@ our@@ able &quot; . &quot; &quot;
bri@@ tish invent@@ ors will set up a micro@@ chip in order to come with a handful of movement in home and car
&quot; a bri@@ tish invent@@ or is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip so that he can open his door@@ step , enter your office and even start with a mobile movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had impl@@ anted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and for@@ ef@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory An@@ a@@ es@@ thesi@@ sts in Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to make sure the impl@@ ant method is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs impl@@ anted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the firm of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the castles in houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per castle . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now built both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , a Marine Hel@@ ic@@ opter to fly to the South La@@ wn for an event that costs American manufacturing last month , costs tax pay@@ ers to the T@@ IME magazine for up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programmes . &quot;
President Donald Tru@@ mp and Vice President Mike P@@ ence and leading officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
&quot; the helic@@ opter was issued next to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ plane car from Wisconsin and a for@@ kli@@ ft truck from Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the White office of the White House required the presence of helic@@ opter in a frag@@ mentary order or F@@ RA@@ GO , hardly 36 hours before the helic@@ opter based on Hel@@ ic@@ opter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helic@@ opter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted that you are aware of it because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; wrote the com@@ mander of H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the Deputy nav@@ y for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helic@@ op@@ ters arrived at the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 pm , and so long stayed until the lawn were vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 at this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that , in case of departure should be del@@ ayed from the White House , due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would need for the return flight . &quot;
the original flight service was during the event at the helic@@ opter while the security sper@@ son@@ al of the unit remained at the floor during the time .
&quot; from the records provided by the T@@ IME provided , it was not clear whether a second flight service was required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act provides state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ government ownership for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the appointment .
&quot; a question that we presented was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; wrote the command@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; said the dep@@ uty com@@ mander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political tones .
&quot; on the event , the president gave an impetus to reform of the health reform that was on the Senate in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ acted the efforts to util@@ isation of the government &apos;s rules . &quot;
&quot; the use of the plane , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is from politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now , President are oblig@@ ated to use them for the journey . &quot;
&quot; but their use only for a photo @-@ op request , is un@@ common . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp conducted an examination in February , when the presidential plane was taken in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ services , and his Twitter account is full of announ@@ cements that describe the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Chairman of the White House , Lin@@ d@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training flights in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn through to reset the U.S. President in the White House with precise centimeters . &quot;
&quot; as Tru@@ mp beginning of July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced in the White House 58 A@@ chi@@ ev@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event en@@ umer@@ ated in the training needs of the flight service for the month , said an official . &quot;
helic@@ opter @-@ units also flew 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were not presented to any of the other Re@@ qu@@ is@@ ites , which were presented at the event . &quot;
a speaker of Si@@ kor@@ sky said the company was not involved to make the helic@@ opter at the South La@@ wn .
&quot; MX records has no budget for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to St@@ un@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Defense Ministry for the Financial Year 2017 , the DO@@ D refund is available for the V@@ H @-@ 3D with 24@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot;
records of unity draw the flight time of the plane than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost of operation of the helic@@ opter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for the refund is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs involved in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the refund for DO@@ D do not contain the costs of personnel , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract . &quot;
&quot; at this time the former pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the helic@@ opter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present this week things which are made in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I go out of that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helic@@ opter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; it is of course appropriate , that highlight . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp com@@ for@@ ated with the helic@@ opter when he entered his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the seat of a fire@@ wall . &quot;
in the White House Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and scher@@ rolled with the media about its own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

&quot; in his h@@ ast to en@@ acted the law , the Congress have packed a few &quot; constitutional rules &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ amed of the US . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft was to pun@@ ish European companies that help Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , investors of the domestic O@@ MV have been financed since then with other European firms the construction of the Russian Baltic coast line 2 . &quot;
the dro@@ pl@@ ine is enormous .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have to bring sanctions to life even per Executive Order . &quot;
twelve weapons are at stake .
&quot; the press &quot; has been seen , which the Group could deny it , and what it really could do . &quot;

role back@@ wards : the city represents 46 kitchen
the city organiz@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the city &apos;s restaurants the clock is returned .
&quot; on September 1 , the town of Kre@@ feld is taking over the food supply in the municipal child@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Vice @-@ leader in the field of youth aid , this is a good news : &quot; we are all very happy . &quot;
&quot; in addition , besides the house : a Cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh cooked @-@ cooled . &quot;
&quot; the city operates in the areas of 46 children of children , in 44 get the children of mid@@ day @-@ time a warm meal . &quot;
&quot; last year , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children , the 45 week@@ days are looked after , in the cas@@ ita for lunch , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in 35 @-@ hour care , if children up to 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
&quot; 46 sub @-@ time workers , from 1 September kitchen service : they warm@@ ed the Anglo @-@ made dishes , supplement them to salad , Roh@@ k@@ ost and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , give the food out , rooms , wash , and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a c@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there is one @-@ sided as well as sev@@ ent@@ ail @-@ related facilities - decides about the timetable .
&quot; the kitchen family are now firmly made to the K@@ ita Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; thus they are much more involved , and it is easier for the genital cutting , educational concepts . &quot;
and this is why it is about healthy food and cooking .
&quot; the children should help , prepare the food . &quot;
the direct connection to the kitchen force is there sense .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the cas@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not ever changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far also task of the kitchen staff - will be settled in the future by specialized cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , it also has the charm that they turned into the cost between self @-@ reg@@ ie and foreign award for the city as the most economical , it means out of the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part of time will be set new . &quot;
&quot; but these hours fall at approximately 750 people in the educ@@ ator area at all not so strong into weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;

G@@ MB concerns about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a union would like to look at Man@@ sion of the Bis@@ cu@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company s@@ ells over the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , which is beside other products hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea Kek@@ se . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said , he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot;
he added that employees and trade union representatives were first experienced when their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the branch of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to speak &quot; concerns , that the financing for the modernisation of production lines do not be prop@@ elled forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workforce can concentrate on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advantageous situation . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ xit , the increasing cost of life and the chronic production of production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently urgently needed an industri@@ alised production facility at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person from Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; the branch of T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to that as we estimate the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we deb@@ ated with the employees that we operate as all companies working in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we regularly check our stores and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to competitive competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; over the past few years we have invested in our T@@ oll@@ cross site more than 5 million pounds , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site , and all of them should change our operations at the location , the employees and their trade @-@ union representatives are the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona pre @-@ warned three years before N@@ ey@@ mar .
the site of La Liga likes to regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain won &apos;t release in her persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar , after having issued an offer of £ 189 million to dis@@ solve his free@@ zing ball , but have warned them about three years prior to the world domination ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has stopped the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the past season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United returned . &quot;
&quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and for the highest @-@ paid pro @-@ sports@@ men of the world . PS@@ G offers sal@@ aries of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way that N@@ ey@@ mar took his way out after outside , although a source in the vicinity of the Catal@@ ans notice is that the club has always gave his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago from the PS@@ G Presidents before this prospect war@@ ns ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club , who wanted to sign one of the best players from PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; but if they try to let one of our players sign in sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish Association began to express interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow it to the International from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by lost one of their price offers to N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report dis@@ closing Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report to the ab@@ norm@@ alized cases de@@ bur@@ dened Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and histori@@ an Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report for the ab@@ norm@@ ality in the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen is further concerned .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ ant , spokes@@ man of reform@@ ists &quot; We are &quot; Church , &quot; stated after the publication of the German press agency , he anticipated by the former Reg@@ ensburger Bishop and today Car@@ dinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as from the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ ed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an excuse . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own sub@@ mits or their at that time . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , criti@@ ci@@ zed that in the reporting of violence at the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen is measured with &quot; two &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; regarding the gri@@ ps in Regensburg , no one knows that it would be prevented from &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful acts , &quot; which may be pen@@ alized and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree medi@@ al mani@@ pulation &quot; , &quot; says the &quot; &quot; Grad @-@ mani@@ pulation &quot; , &quot; as the author &apos;s in Luc@@ etta Scar@@ af@@ fia , histori@@ an and a member of the national Italian bio@@ ethics committees . &quot;
&quot; the habit , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of the everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion that is normal for normal &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ af@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; the prin@@ cess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said in an interview with the Bav@@ arian Rund@@ funk : &quot; you like to go on to the church , and that is a glimp@@ se of fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; it also pointed out that in her youth &quot; blo@@ ws &quot; have been a quite normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means , &quot; to be finished with friends , as I was one , ready to cope with . &quot;
&quot; they are unfair to use today &apos;s standards for past decades , because the world has changed . &quot;
in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse often the pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often emerged .
&quot; un@@ just@@ ly , the author and histori@@ an Michael Hes@@ emann , who recorded with R@@ atz@@ inger of the &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Ez@@ emann , &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; he pointed out the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report that was presented by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg with the En@@ light@@ enment Ulrich Weber Weber ?
&quot; a total of 547 Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were victims between 1945 and the early 1990s &quot; with high pl@@ au@@ sibility &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who has been active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in conclusion , that of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. have been applied physically and psychological violence in many cases . &quot;
&quot; even with high emoti@@ on@@ ality , the punishment of the students could even fail heavily . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , unlike many other def@@ endants , many victims suffer the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases despite violence they even connect with it . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Ez@@ emann , the final report of the ab@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger explains in his opinion . &quot;
Mr. Ez@@ emann , the 440 @-@ pages report on the &quot; pre @-@ violence perpet@@ rated by the &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; there is a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , many pupils stand up his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perf@@ ection@@ ist that has been tangible by the Ö@@ f@@ teren when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz has no top @-@ performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate as its bio@@ graph this final report ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : when you read the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front until the rear , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger occurs in it at all . &quot;
he is only dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspic@@ ion of medi@@ al or co @-@ ordination in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
also the non @-@ violence at the pres@@ ch@@ schule proceeds outside of its efficiency .
you can only imagine them late or not taken seriously enough of it too late or have taken the first evidence .
&quot; the cathedral @-@ place , on which he acting , was felt by practically all respon@@ dents than - so literally - &quot; &quot; Rede@@ mption &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes a very excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; sincerely , &quot; &quot; sincerely , &quot; &quot; sincerely , &quot; &quot; sincerely , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincerely , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincerely , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sincerely , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; knowled@@ geable &quot; , &quot; the guys p@@ oured with cakes , bis@@ cu@@ its and Bon@@ b@@ ons , and is always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority value himself through its perf@@ ection@@ ism and its high emoti@@ on@@ ality that led to W@@ ut@@ ational bro@@ ods .
&quot; that he did not only cut down with chairs , and thre@@ w the mud and scre@@ wed down to the ground , but also scre@@ wed guys to the hair or ears , he has already given earlier years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; however , in order to his honor , however , it must be said that such educ@@ ators in the frag@@ ment period , the 1960s and se@@ ven@@ ties were widespread , with parents such as teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think of all of us who was born of 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also have this in a sec@@ ular school , a state @-@ school , experienced . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the irre@@ plac@@ eable sexual abuse and the non @-@ violence at the pres@@ ch@@ schule , are the detached Bag@@ at@@ elles . &quot;
&quot; if you ask yourself , whether it was not with his promin@@ ence and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ kt X@@ V@@ I. , that many media has just rus@@ hed to him . &quot;
&quot; on Bay@@ er@@ ischer pop@@ e , many who never have understood him nor ever . &quot;
but the truth is : the report de@@ bur@@ dened Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; in the media , the report has reported a lot about the issue of abuse at the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is placed in the final report also some or@@ der@@ ling or co @-@ ordination in terms of sexual abuse and load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual gri@@ ps claims to have become familiar to the dom@@ ic@@ ular champion .
not even the parents were de@@ consec@@ rated .
&quot; I have never dre@@ amed to speak with my Father or my mother , &quot; &quot; said a stran@@ ger for the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot;
the real problem in enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is yet that most victims are not silent on the silence .
&quot; if they don &apos;t even familiar with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader who would have been quite some of the do@@ ers of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a survey students form@@ ulating it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see any case in which he would have imagined ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpet@@ rators .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd , accept that they rested ? bub@@ bles in@@ tru@@ ders or more clearly or more likely to have opened as compared to their parents , dormit@@ ory , trust , etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able .
&quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; that the students involved in advance and / or their surroundings could not be confirmed in the examination of the investigation . &quot;
what sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free of any fellow @-@ knowing . &quot;
&quot; thus , it cannot be accused , not prevented him or put it to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to reconc@@ ile his good name with this res@@ ale crime , as it was unfortunately taken in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , there was much of &quot; non @-@ violence &quot; with the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was thrown away in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem , that in the coverage it was mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and non@@ violence and somewhere , in the midst of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but that is precisely the mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; namely , there is always clean separated : between the pre @-@ school and the gymn@@ asium , between sexual abuse and violence , we say once , other benefits . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report describes inci@@ dents from the time since 1945 , thus also for four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir head of the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; the whole terrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases , in which l@@ ad of s@@ adi@@ sti@@ le teachers were controlled and mal@@ nour@@ ished , they opened up at the pres@@ ch@@ schule in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to be prevented . &quot;
&quot; but with whom , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , for he got the boys first to face as they were already on the cathedral @-@ place . &quot;
&quot; on that was , as most witnesses emphas@@ ise the subject of &quot; &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; it was just happy to escape , and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly . &quot; &quot;
what was different on the cathedral @-@ playing residence ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no s@@ adi@@ c violence . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many sacrific@@ es the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases despite violence they even connect with him . &quot;
&quot; at most , a maximum still is the throw away to have washed away . &quot;
but despite all efforts the report could only define two periods in which he was reported from the states at the pres@@ ch@@ schule .
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the happ@@ en@@ ings at a school , where he did not want to hear anything , and then again in 1993 . &quot;
wear Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the stands consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ths , which the report even re@@ produced . &quot;
&quot; therein he indicates that , &quot; &quot; that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool the test should continue to be practiced . &quot;
&quot; even in view of the risk of negative press figures , he received urgent progress . &quot;
&quot; it was of course at a time when legal clarity existed , as a test case was not forbidden in Bavaria too . &quot;
&quot; before that , they opened themselves in a legal gray area , just as each one of us still knows . &quot;
&quot; there was also difficult to estimate for him , where those affected may be exagger@@ ated or dramatic , and where really the permitted border had been exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but you can not say , it would have always been di@@ gest@@ ed . &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the filing was officially cancelled in Bavaria too . &quot;
&quot; prin@@ cess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said yes , it is unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to the dam@@ aging time . &quot;
how do you see this ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we were talking about the &quot; &quot; pit@@ falls of the an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; thus the danger to evaluate the past in today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
there the prin@@ cess has already been right .
&quot; but that of course does not apply to sexual abuse that at all times was ab@@ omin@@ able and also not for what was broken in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of ad@@ versity and violence against inno@@ cent pedi@@ atri@@ sts , that goes far beyond that time . &quot;
this is all very aw@@ ful and I am glad that it is finally up to work .
&quot; but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in shelter , for all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means for discipl@@ ined and punishment , so ear@@ ing and to drag the hair and ears , were widely used in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as a physical punishment then , it has also strictly kept in it . &quot;
&quot; what picture of his Reg@@ ensburger time , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has given back to you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
did the topic test and speak about the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , thus Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells from his perspective , as the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played just a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I don &apos;t mean that he has led there a stric@@ ter Reg@@ iment . &quot;
&quot; but even that must be said once again : without this perf@@ ection@@ ism , without the un@@ demanding discipline , it would probably be hardly possible to form the national known Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( in 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) on tour . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cu@@ its and Bon@@ sa@@ ons alone , one does not even make a big singer and face every success in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of people have you experienced for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during talks on their book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : by working on the book and in addition I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really very well and experienced again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , land@@ lords , deep believers , and heart@@ ed people , of which one could not imagine that he could possibly have a little or a fly . &quot;
&quot; I get regularly coming to him regularly , like many former domains , 23 years after his Emer@@ ging , periodic@@ ally contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him up to the present day , so he was strictly speaking to them , so are clearly in the minority . &quot;
&quot; most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are today grateful for him , that he enriched their lives and giving them the world of music . &quot;
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ern@@ al teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely respect of respect , to which they still look up and to worship them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clear , all that you thre@@ e@@ jects him are educ@@ ators , which were then on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be glad that we have overcome this time ago .
&quot; but it is highly un@@ just , a man , only because he has promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make medi@@ al sinn@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; there is the nasty intention , that is behind it , just too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , dischar@@ ged him . &quot;
&quot; now , the landing stage would have a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria , and maybe even Germany no one would like to know the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
