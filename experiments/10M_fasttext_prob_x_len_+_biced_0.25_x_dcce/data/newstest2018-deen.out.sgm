<seg id="3">"a pit-pit, where now is dug for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Small-gardeners manage the one-sided cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to day.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when maps are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">"that knows everyone who had already had to rain, because the auto-Navi was held instead of a reversal road a green meadow."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlases, an offer of Geoportals Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but current - but it is very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compares them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and churches have changed in the spread-area of the Münchner Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a makesestry which one is not recognisable as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large map of view were presented for cities and communities in more detail maps, so-called urpositional sheets."</seg>
<seg id="13">These emerged according to the Bayergen Administration Department between 1810 and 1864 and skip the first Vermessung Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Koalitionwar with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wished an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording Bayerns in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops moved to the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801, it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a surface-covered Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Max IV. Joseph drove the project further forward, founded the" topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bayerische persecution."</seg>
<seg id="19">The urpositional sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like to find all others on the Bayerisches Library website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of Early / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown up.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is subsendling that appears in the map of 1856 relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was joined in 21 years after creation of the map, so 1877, as a Münchner district."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, it is lying in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses subsendings focus around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße which was named in 1878 to Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian farmers against Austria 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing but fields - at the first glance: at the Hinooms a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: hand numbered plots from the so-called" judgment "which was derived from the basic tax."</seg>
<seg id="27">"small plots currently occupy no longer farmers, but small gardeners of the plant in the sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is characterized north of subsendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 Schauplatz of the Oktoberwirt, was in fact a meadow - and not concrete form."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the face of the present district Au-Haidhausen is not only read by the name Au-Haidhausen, not only the name of the" "Gasteig" "or of the hight" "On the ventilation" "- but also in big letters" Irren Anstalt. ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstrasse there was once more predified people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">There was 1858 / 59 the Münchner district-Irrenanstalt "On the Auer Lüch.</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard of guerridden was brought in connection with the deaths of King Ludwigs II in connection with the death of King Ludwigs."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time, and for example the Ankters of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"he is also prohibited to use the staff to apply violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the Anstalt. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"first place for 280 patients had first place, later it was extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity will no longer be out - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006 the Isar-Amper-Latikum Munich, is one of the biggest psychiatrists in Germany since 2006."</seg>
<seg id="40">"on the area of former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in the Münchner Salesianum."</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order was established in 1920 and turned him into a youth home with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">"located west of the TSV München East, east of the 1980s from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children-house" "Casa Don Bosco" "was established in an architectural approach to the origin of the Irrenanstalt, who was destroyed during the Second World War."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was at 1856 as" main square "," the merchant road was named "" Kaufinger Gasse "." "</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies outlines the city of December 1944 many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A great stayed until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the German Institute, small business houses and a pit-chapel from the Middle Ages were once born on the Marienhof, where these days work and take place on 5 April 2017, the spatenstich for the second S-Bahn line."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich map can be compared to the aerial photograph of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>

<seg id="51">The national union to promote color-above has issued a warning for colored people that go to Missouri's policy and racist attacks by Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the federal state Missouri, which is to enter into force by August 28, 2017, following particular attention, Afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourianer demands special attention, since a number of fragrant, racenbased incidents in the whole state shall occur and here," says it is in the opinion of the group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it difficult to claim Discrimination, as well as the enforcement authorities of the state, the disproportionate effect on minorities, prompted the group to recover the itinerary, the NAACP said."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights, the people happen."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organisation for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group incidents like racist deceased against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"sin died under fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year, after having lost no gasoline during the journey through the state, and was taken by the police of Missouri, without a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also pointed out a recent report by Missouri office, which is shown that black drivers in the state 75 percent are more common than the White House."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of and their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be willing to bring it or let the relatives know that they are travelling by the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 Hassverbreak in 2015, according to the latest figures from the Hassverised reporting programme of the FBI, which is the state in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">"the itinerary is also an answer to a new Missouri Law, which would make it harder to complain a company for living or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, published after the States of immigration law had to commit people due to immigration law, resulting in view of the ACES to the other rattle benefits."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel options are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries, but recently, stakeholders have been used to measure the measure as a response to specific laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Weiressing project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Weimar Weiresaun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-German parlamentary Peter White and Kordula Kovac have created a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the justification of the family Schwendemann met representatives of the fisherman CDU village together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann granted first insights into his farm, in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk, and also many young animals, and also houses in five apartments resort guests."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "black milk" "is for him the alternate marketer for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the holiday guests will only come to Regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also called BLHV-Chairman of Fischerbach, he described the Weiresaunproject as" "spontaneous." ""</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "I can not be profitable in such steep areas."</seg>
<seg id="76">"the grassarea care for a lot of work, much of which can be processed with the engine sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and with the topography," stressed Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the elteristic operation and managed these without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he has no biooperations."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "the Commune has recognized the meaning of the pasture project, and is pleased with the leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euro per hectare, farmers would have to support farmers."</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that so the performance of the areas might be crossed out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure that we have, are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts on how they continue their operation," emphasized the mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism due to the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">With a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">"the entertainment area is 40 hectares, which may not be forced until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the overall height of 71 500 Euro, half over leader was funded, a quarter carried by the municipality of Fischerbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmer has had to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometres of consecrated."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac said:" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and farmers."</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter Weiss:" "here is the best food produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscaping unit (LPR) Baden-Württemberg makes the state support of wheat.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Black Chamber.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the LPR approved pile.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the enclosed area is not conclusive (Hangover 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by forestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the fisherman Weiresaunproject 2018 we currently runs an application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of Zaun."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the entertainment area corresponds 35 hectares, the calender costs are at more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the destruction of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key-ideologists of the Trump-régime, knew what he did, when he took a symbolic axe in a hitful dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the president to the drastic immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of jetties and liberty imitators would have punched him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he laid hold of their importance, and especially the meaning that you were attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after completion of the monument, its base was added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta paves:" "I don't want to go here on a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that shines the world."</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you relate to later was added later and not part of the original freedom of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is right, right, but as he formulated yourself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance on the emerging words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your poor, thy poor, and your bekanged masses that craving after it, free to breathe / the elend waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "miserable waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller's not engaged in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural struggle: it is indeed a conflict in the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who put themselves in place their words after their death on the base - knew very good that they are a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the links between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in their poem is the female figure no longer abstractly - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives himself a very different name: mother of Exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and exactly as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change this long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the big scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the decay for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty was not guilty, but rather an early neo-conservative, that the American flame is moving into the hidden world:" "Lady Liberty is proceeding."</seg>
<seg id="119">It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not intended to shine the way into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">Rather unusual is Limbs here on something engraved.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and certainly a matter of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted in it to see how they saw by the deplating, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the Decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"of course this is not the perspective, the Miller and Trump would ever want to recognise."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch is not supposed to shine the way, but the hatred, who is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">WHC 2017: Neil Black logs Scottish members of the UK</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle remembered as only two villi to the Great Britain's team.</seg>
<seg id="130">"the Director-Director of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-heads concave contingent on the World Championship is a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record of Scottish Athleten was selected for London 2017 which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes in Scotland developed a little special" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand and we will continue there until we figure it out," said Black. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think there is something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish Athlete thinking that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish Athleten are medals-candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - the fight against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eiliie Doyle was elected by the crew to the team."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is pretty modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"their captain's speech was amazing," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling that Eiliie did quite naturally, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth-silver medal winner, which is compete in their fifth world Championships with the 400-m-hurts, says that it is" incredible "that 16 chicks are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's greatest number of athletes at the World Championship has been seven who were signed in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">"the Muir Runner Muir leads on this path, and has placed five British and two European records last year."</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 metres."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another shot, which one should observe after a great season, which included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle has remembered their first World Championships as the only other soons in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" hugely proud "on the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team but in some cases also in the medals and in the Finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing to be in this chapter is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour, but knowing that my team mates voted for me and chose me, making it very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I am very proud of all the villi that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes, who want to rise on podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech as a capitalization affects?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation since we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">"it is therefore really important to put on this home support and benefit from it, that we are back at the Olympiastadion."</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will simply be a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Block critic on Facebook: diswiring you not to be a public office if you cannot bear the heat-up of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our land knew something from poor press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last until the newspapers suggested him because of all, from the internal policy up to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he shouted with criticism, safe."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not brought his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783, Washington said:" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led as the sheep to respect."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">"Hoges employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people, and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union chased him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the Stab of the Governors left the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with" "Well, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is just Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a republicanic Governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the Supreme approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his State and strict compliance with the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillfully to use Facebook as a primary instrument to connect with his voters and to debate his hairy head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blockade of individuals who are on the side of the Governors - the public forum is to be officially designated as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post Defense, Hoge spokesperson Amelia Chasse the acts of the Governors and argued that the blockade of comments is nothing more than a moderator."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too simple to use the image of trolles or spasps or hasserted folks that vibrate online the whip-schwingen.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people who have been blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"these are just real people who speak with their chosen guides, a teacher, a entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profited."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appelded to the Gregans of the Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Lakshmi Sarshmi Sarma Ramani of Boas, Md., was not hasserted, but she asked to break down."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to Hassadbreaking and other current news, she wrote in the commentary box of the post-direction" The Post "." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people are standing on the same subject, then they are abused by some more than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"as the employee of the Governor as" "focused spam attack" "would probably be called" intercession. ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critics or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in former times when you had done the same, that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical ladders and to burn or bring protesters and to silence."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that is exactly what happens digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official that he criticiates Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is used by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was the last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors des Loudoun County captured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District rectifier James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they have a voters from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky received Governor Matt Bevin (R) also a visit from the ACES because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of the affordable PORTOS had a similar effect on the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter to his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had an anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"people who used pseudonyme like" Juricola, "" Belisarius "," "Belisarius" and "Portius", "all letters to newspapers, Washington's decisions made down."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petition, who criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping with Britain, be overwhelmed, according to the historical documents made by the online papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not brought them to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse belong to the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means to accept this.</seg>

<seg id="1320">"before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I sought after something, which was similar to my price."</seg>
<seg id="1322">This flat was shown in Earls Court and had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I have fallen in love with them and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first tour the 1,000 square-fox was completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom estate with a wasted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add a pasta space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"this was my request," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, the architectural and Designstudio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two spaces, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine, where you could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creative in order to release the award.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel station is quite complicated," "he explains."</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were skipped over, without that we had to die."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about to build a simple platform, but the steel so that he had the right height for the function or at the bottom."</seg>

<seg id="1346">"thanks to the cleverly use of space and storage space, Joanne could win additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the basic surface - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and a calculation can perform based on the bottom size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they have managed to enlarge the floor area, while also use high quality materials, which give the room to its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love you into the electric plugs, in the walls."</seg>

<seg id="1392">"Politico reports that the new Stef of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Trump, including the reports of the news media - in the hope to keep the boss at a simultaneous course."</seg>

<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Stef of the White House, met on his first working day with leading employees, he exhibited a main problem in President Donald Trumps of the White House which he wants to repair wool: poor information, into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the staff that information on him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information.</seg>

<seg id="1397">"President Trumps relationship with television dates back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if it was annoyed by Trump because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of places that were to convince," said the former electoral adviser Sam Nunberg in February to the Politico. "</seg>

<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign trams do something that we do not know others - that Trumps Tweets could not contain any more grips without their intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets which Trump has not been sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if he managed to maintain his employees some times, anger from him, then their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"but no one has consistently prevented it, that Trump control has emerged."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem consists in the fact that people in a White House embraces up from competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by promoting Trump material that may possibly fosters their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Politico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the fondness of the consultants, the president for strategic reasons to bring out beyond doubt."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that was described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-officials say that Trump may react to negative press sections, especially such with damaged leaks and that it comes to out where these originate."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this is exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone featured a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy rod of Katie Walsh," the source behind a heap to be of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was banished because of chicks permanently from Twitter or that he has offered no concrete evidence, or that he expressed false allegations in the past and voke her."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started to wonder people about Walsh.</seg>

<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>

<seg id="1810">The employees of the Weekly Riodoce meet to meet their plans for the reporting of the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and uneaseless drug wars. "</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">"it has been told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what is safer to feel secure: you are supposed to take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with granulates or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a board on the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Verbally."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"you ask the reporters to propose name for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and pancreas."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug control, politicians, businessmen, journalists, who are suspected, on the secret list of government or cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest on violence, and while in the whole country the corpses are hooks, there are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto be held in December 2012 after attacks and threats under federal government and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, their editors and inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake it is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"its lack will be deeply felt, although his presence is present everywhere - a large picture of Valdez, which shows its central finger at the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that will be his smiled face with glasses or its typical Panamonte."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the Reporter discuss their shared topics, the trauma, its nightmares, Paranoia, Paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although in 2010 a Sonja's office was established to process the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists only introduced two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with the majority of those thousands of Morden, each year linked with drug trading and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely provided."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"with Riodoce they still insist on dealing with the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting, and although the terrain is now still in traitor."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without any information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for discussion of security, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why, mischids we all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"in the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced by his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" "twelve river". ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap took away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to move freely to Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez there are virtually nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans remuneration in the past year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloodiest slaughter of the country, since rivalry groups struggle to fill in the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't make sure that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the road or that the graveyard is full of mixed, two-storey mice, which are bigger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget for a minute that there is a state of" tranquility, "if only a Kartell control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading routes in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February the release of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cartels in the war with Guzmans sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the children, suspected gangsters bought each copy of the output as soon as they were delivered to publishers."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second error was to force Valdez in her, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had released the same story to leave the country into his own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend of Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">"he had so long survived, that his friends and colleagues had annexed that he would always be there."</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he was in 2003 as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he joined forces with five colleagues for the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without encounter the smokdote problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"at the time the newspaper earned a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters love to publish hard-wise studies without fear of censorship, and the readers were intrigued by a publication in which they could read stories that anyone else handle."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the creation of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever they lead."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave voluntarily to that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trading in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take the task which falls as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what have you done in view of so many stills... why did you not say what was going on?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team missing Valdez, the spawnbird, which was like a port workers, the friend, who knew generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survived."</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trust on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his guard.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and there is always sitting there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now ask her: was his love for the routine to be routine?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also compelled them to ask their own assumptions about how they do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like it if you are dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their insidious starting point and runways, to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-keeping."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instinmarkets.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it. "</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarse, that 'smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened to Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, such as he and others are saying, are in Sinaloa not more - just as did in Tamaulipas, VERACRUZ, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government agencies are at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the employees of Riodoce met for safety training, suddenly there were no mobile phones allowed. days previously was known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"out there were two policemen, protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were asked by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-class area of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the mitter, some of the reporters were asking if these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen, which the Governor himself is not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago, since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug-gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has blown on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the former known boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state of government who focused on the hometown of the Governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, an abduction."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word on who kidnapped or what it happened, so caution was advisable when it was time to write that everybody in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite locally from drug retailers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter made from public records, that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy, who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (Pri), which dominated almost the whole century of all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several pri governors were accused of high-class cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman went a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months ago the readers had seen the Kolumne of Valdez as the best informed source about kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"sooner we have known what happened," "Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "El FLACO" "because of its slender body."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez became a storage room for characters and stickers, dedicated to the Morde of journalists, because the employees have become something which they themselves would never expected, activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">"reporter Miriam Ramirez away a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning, because of another journalist at the office of the prosecutor's office."</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA testing, that it is its."</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists all over the country have become more powerful than they have been written in organized protests "SOS Press" on hearing and construction.</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, director Bojorquez is away from Washington and tried to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"in a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa, on the day following the assassination of Valdez accused Ramirez the authorities, journalists spose and bring it because they said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has since been asked for that she is re-shared by the government, because it is concerned that their anger has injured their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico organized by organised crime, to be involved in government bodies and a consistent society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism "he wrote that reporter are not only killed by medications, but also on command of politicians and security guards, organized with organised crime under a ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the Media Wächler group" Articulo 19 "has conducted more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico-minded you, because they want you disproportionate the mouth," said Ramirez. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the Morde have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody is forgetting the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>

<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic is the armored plant-fresser that best preserved Fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he was located on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that appeared from the surrounding cliff error on board, and decided to see more accurately."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered Fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2.500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy ground."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished product is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just think a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is visible. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will come into the history of knowledge as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this plant-eaters, although he is like with a armor covered and a changing tanks, probably endangered by meat frescoed dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly arched dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from carnivores, and used a shielding technology that is used as a countering, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed it to mix better in his surroundings and to dodge his enemies, say experts, which indicates that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurier was made for the first time headlines and now is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta striking after the Museumstechniker Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen made it to Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern as well as the form of thrust and armours about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter shaded, a widespread defence method in the animal-rich, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its bottom."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter shady is common, the results are surprising since the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs was hunted by sufficient pressure by meat frescos dinosaurs that the evolution emitting the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that employ the counter shady - think of deer, zebras or gush-animals - are much smaller and violable than loot, which was signaled that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behaviour on a massive, strongly armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been the crayon time," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal on references to his life, including his concerted Darminent, to find out what it had eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs died, when he died, into a river, and driven into the sea where he went on the backs to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta were as warm as south-orida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much more displaced than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preservatives skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the beast," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal is almost exactly the same as in the early chalk time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need much imagination to use it to design it. if you just have a little bit with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is at bedtime."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time, when giant thermal opoda, carnivorous dinosaur, which rose up on two legs, the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the boarched dinosaurs was hunted by some of its frightened ancestors."</seg>

<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta received after death in the sea and by mud mumified."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum it is the punched dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armaments, and is complete from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>

<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to their core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"only one day after having arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis Gebal on the bed of an airbnb apartment, which she rented and scrolling through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled upon a mail from someone out of high school.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year child, and there is still on the street," says it there. "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, because nobody had posted the information on their Feed, closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the handle @ theePharoah was constantly delivered on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the Rapper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white police officers in Ferguson, Mo., killed, live to tweets."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of blacksmith's body that was stretched on the road and stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that is wild," Ferrel thought. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for her and her community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She placed her cell phone to return later in the evening to Tweets via humans at the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos from the police band and people, the cried, and by a man who said to be a sign with the writing:" Fergusons police have just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">They watched a live-feed where a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a rebellious dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, confessed a different policeman his gun and crying:" I will kill you... animals all kill. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," recalled Ferrell at her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">That is not the kind of murder that we used to accustomed to and which we can name typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">In that moment I felt shook.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"I was angry, crying."</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock they took her 6-year old daughter from the house of her father, and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? "in the movie theaters from 11 years."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and the Protestant, the love and loss of strength, strength and resistance, which consists of the point of view of the people living in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"in general with her daughter who contributed a flower-dress and a suitable crown to Ferguson, the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black condition. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you, when black people have to fight for what they believe?" reminded them what she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we are now going to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take it," said Ferrell later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">You have to know and take it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it needs to be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have luck to give her an experience in which she personally experienced no blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would prove her a bad service to keep them away."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which was invited to a camp as the activist on the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">There were Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets in front of and helped to pass them on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began a new type of activism for fervent shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed after 9 August," "she said and notices that she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell arrived during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-director of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, her and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted only" "document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question asked Ferrell in the meaning:" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can utilize?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community that benefited by her pain and her resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently declared in an interview:" "we heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field, which is known for its activism around deaths."</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought the project closer to the project together with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years to Browns shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us. we speak," "Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, because so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferrells experience - to show that it comes with the movement" not to a messiah-leader, but a communion, "said Folayan - she proved to be the obvious participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"consequently, documents of" Whose Streets "show documents from" Whose Streets? "a surprisingly personal aspects of Ferran's life, as she loves himself and her wife marries."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrel and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be certain vulnerability in this work and in the inhumanity of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells have history the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have shaped the film" Blackpurple Matter "in social media, identify themselves as sulul."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must carry the main load of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to notice that" "the movement is really kept alive by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it is obvious that" this is not a affirmative type of action, in general, due to their identity as the heart of the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook her energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not accidental, though it was on the front front, because with a life at these crosses than a black, gay woman is as much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the news cameras arrived in Ferguson have long gone, but the racial links between the municipality and the police have continued."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is at currency for 2 ½ years because of the blockade of a highway in a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she cling to a song and she feels committed to this memory, since she went over three years ago in Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love each other and support.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "Wiwahn": TV-reader discuss about bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people though they are not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">"but the idea of a shopping centre on the south-east of the pedestrian zone divides since the first presentation 2009, the population in advocates and opponents."</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold makes the issue hardly anything.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Also on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"during the one bit of the bit-gallery:" this would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" "That would be real" "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side," "does not need a man" "(Siggi Badding) or quite simply:" "size wahn!" (Lars Scholz). "</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the proponents reconstruct that a gallery draws more customers into the city, of which the rest of the stores will benefit, fear the pedestrian precinct."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added: the gallery will be set exactly on the property, on which the farm market hall stands, in the 13 direct market positions."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"at the beginning of the construction works, it will be at the end."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the Gallery Macher want to integrate a markethall into the new building, namely the Beda place with possibility of sitting outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been selling almost weekly in the farmhouses market for many years now.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the Landfrauen always very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Even the butcher we have discovered for us too.</seg>
<seg id="2101">"we would like to have a chance to maintain this offer during and especially after the construction of the gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"in particular, the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Gerd Densing:" "whether director merged in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the amount of rent."</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, it may not be low at the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what shopping-branches in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"clothes, shoes, dryers or supermarkets: I find that superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">"one sees however, how many stores here are empty here - some for months and years."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but here there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that we at least maintain the market hall."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered are fresh, mostly directly from the producer and is very inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, store stores in a shopping scenter only from larger companies, because the local tenants are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special stores are almost no longer and what still exists, will probably still disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a mall with a market hall is not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where should the farmhouses market during the building period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old Edeka would be the solution - even in time, if the bit gallery will actually come."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"or does it already create the Gespenst bit-gallery before, all business transactions made from Bitburg?"</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"a shopping center, which is empty, needs no one."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to make a real farm market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a farm market hall, yes, thanks to the insane many - as I find - sensuous construction projects in Bitburg is no place more."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmhouses was broken, another piece of culture will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">An appropriate similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown that are almost incomparably similar - those on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist in Heather Dewey-Hagz from wangen-Tupppers and haircuts that were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence service analyzer after they made a 35-year arrest warrantee after they made a secret diplomatic reports on the website WikiLeaks publicly."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on August 2nd, is called A Becoming resemblance (An appropriate similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"it is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagz, whose discipline was converted to their expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and creing, a Transwife and pioneering Dissists whose condemnation from Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithms, which was extracted by Manning, and out of 30 portraits, such as someone can be interpreted by these genomic data - the many ways, as they can be interpreted and the indurated determinants of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already talked openly about the identification as a woman in 2013, including six violations against the Spionagegesetz, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"due to the prison you have been suppressed by the picture, so much that there was only one photo - a basins, black-white selfie, in the Manning can obviously sit uncomfortable on a driver's seat and a platinblonde perch has been associated with which she was also associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of their 2012 project "stranger Visions."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"therein, the artist produced in portraits of foreigners from forensic artifacts such as cigarette mute and chewing gum, by making the DNA from the waste to establish a picture of how these people might look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a period of year.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press conference in the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she was not visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so she took contact with Chelsea and asked whether she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist, and their detainted Muse were reported to unequal corrections, which were interviewed in the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of the Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic" "Suppressed Images", who would foresee a future in which the president Chelyielding judgment would be able to see the exhibition personally. "</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning release after seven brutal years had been calling in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome sort of blissal meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something low and starkes, since Donald Trump introduces a war against informants from the government's camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to fix the rigid divisions, which he actually should fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagz was asked after the strange Timing of all these things, she said that" "things from a certain reason happen."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of the gallery's written artistic statement called Manning with her superbig signature, among them (the" "i" "in her family name is provided with a heart) an end to the automatic fragmentation, whose foundation sex, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousands of cs and GS and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped, showing the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nuclear enoids after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist, as amazing, at least in biological respects, we all are."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring about them is that our genome is not about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell as many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room is a page from the above mentioned Comic-Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning how they appeared with a freelancer in the hand of the disciplined barracks of the United States such as King-Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they face your speech, then they have won", "says it."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never stop the mouth." ""</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote me," "said the artist who salute from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I'm still getting goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it should be foreseen in the comic book - but if they should do it, it will be welcomed in the center of the room by the masks, who merged from their own genomic simulation."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"it was also oriented, as it was all written in the exhibition until the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), where their genetic haploggroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted to feel that they feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagz from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted to feel like a mass movement that feels like Chelsea, like the movement, which is also hidden behind their liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor of the University of Northwestern and a employee of the University of Oxford because of killing</seg>
<seg id="2159">A nationwide crowd hunting is in progress for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford who were looking for a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.</seg>

<seg id="2390">"yes, actually."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex-robots are at the moment a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently published the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR), a report on the development of sex robot in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emeritified Professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye-color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernagel."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make yourself funny, but the company deliver lots of it and we will see them much more frequently," "Mr Sharkey said at the publication of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">"modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon, which feels warm, with conscious human responses, which can be achieved through artificial intelligence."</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs" "and choose everything from the eye-color of the robot about the shape of the nipples up to the type or the color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it is still disturbing, since many robots have the" characters "that would be a steppe-wife progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexes have evolved to robots with a silicon.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix-robot allows for example to suit its users, their robots to the characteristics that they find appealing, such as Schüterness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the True Companion developed Roxxxy Gold Sex-robots with pre-programmed personalities as "Frigid Farrah" which gives the impression of students and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," "blackened the website of True Companion."</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she may not like what you do not like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day her moods - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">They can be tired of fixed on conversation or can be "in the mood."</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects of this uplifting of sex robot - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sublious female characteristics, the analogue to rape, if one is a step on rape, if one is a step on rape as one (here: contradictory) Farrah is a most disturbing one on the most."</seg>

<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibration, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" is it on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not only a fetish or simply just another sex tool."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and its increasing refinement show a little darker and deeper into our culture, to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course keep no sex robot, and while the FRR notices its rising popularity, they still remain provisional at the edge of the consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what can be widened from the edge-zones, can be in terms of the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not weird or offensive until they use the free market for permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is however a certain ledge that these highly evolved sex robots are threatened in a time when the rights of women are threatened globally, in which there is a president in the White House which has lowered women sexually."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most horrible aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical images, the devotives body and the stolen eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The target behind these sex robot is to establish a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also using pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">"their builders want they feel human, that they will imitate the movement of a real body."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help, IBD (inflammation of the intestine)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, might be the symptoms of patients with inflammatory performers."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable state, which in the US affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300.000, causes Magenkrapors and Blacks, recurrent or bloody breakdown, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"during those affected normally, meat and dairy products are likely to avoid their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner University that helps develop an essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins to contribute to the tolerant intestinal cells."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the conductive researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the intestine said to ensure that damaging microbes, that hide themselves in the food, not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells, who are able to dissolve inflammation, become balanced by cells that protect tolerance and protect the body, without insensitive tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in a inflammatory cause."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experiments, it was established that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cells occurs with mice, which carry out a particular bacterium in their unity."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the elements of proteins to dissolve the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestine microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an agrotophan-rich diet tolerant, less inflammatory, less inflammatory, if the same system also wires with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan underwent a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when she found out that a group of spells such cells had, but another group of the same tribe but had not yet had."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbioma had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms, which usually live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were found DNA sequentially and there were six species of bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells but without being lacked with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were raised in a sterile environment so they failed to develop an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria tends to grow on the immune system, the researchers spent L. reuteri in a liquid and then led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that have been isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune-cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"as the active component of the liquid was cleansed, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan-Metabolism that is known as an indol-3-lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the forage of the mice, the number of such cells rose by around 50 percent, but when the tryptophandeed levels were halted, sank the number of cells around half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant conducive cells such as mice and that most of us are protecting L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tractors.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-adrenal products made by L. reuteri the cells in people so develop as with mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory performers."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said:" "the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, as these cells are inflammation towards the inner surface of the intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophandees can lead to a expansion of this population.</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report to the abnormalized cases deburdened Pope Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report for the abnormality in the Regensburger Domspatzen is further concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisant, spokesman of reformists" We are "Church," stated after the publication of the German press agency, he anticipated by the former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeried Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own submits or their at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican" Osservatore Romano "," on the other hand, criticized that in the reporting of violence at the Domspatzen is measured with "two". ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"regarding the grips in Regensburg, no one knows that it would be prevented from" shameful and shameful acts, "which may be penalized and prevented in the future; however, the" degree medial manipulation "," says the "" Grad-manipulation "," as the author's in Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and a member of the national Italian bioethics committees. "</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit, the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion that is normal for normal" "writes Scaraffia."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"the princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bavarian Rundfunk:" you like to go on to the church, and that is a glimpse of frescoes. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"it also pointed out that in her youth" blows "have been a quite normal pedagogical means," to be finished with friends, as I was one, ready to cope with. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">"they are unfair to use today's standards for past decades, because the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse often the pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often emerged.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"unjustly, the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who recorded with Ratzinger of the" "My brother of Pope" "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Ezemann, "for all that had nothing to do with him," he pointed out the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report that was presented by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment Ulrich Weber Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were victims between 1945 and the early 1990s" with high plausibility "victims of overprint, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who has been active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" in conclusion, that of Domkapellmeister R. have been applied physically and psychological violence in many cases. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"even with high emotionality, the punishment of the students could even fail heavily."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, unlike many other defendants, many victims suffer the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases despite violence they even connect with it."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Ezemann, the final report of the abensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger explains in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Ezemann, the 440-pages report on the "pre-violence perpetrated by the" "Regensburger Domspatzen" "there is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"in addition, many pupils stand up his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist that has been tangible by the Öfteren when a Domspatz has no top-performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as its biograph this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: when you read the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front until the rear, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger occurs in it at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is only dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of medial or co-ordination in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the non-violence at the preschschule proceeds outside of its efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can only imagine them late or not taken seriously enough of it too late or have taken the first evidence.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the cathedral-place, on which he acting, was felt by practically all respondents than - so literally -" "Redemption", "" "heaven" "and" "better world". ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"so the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger describes a very excellent testimony," "sincerely," "sincerely," "sincerely," "sincerely," "" sincerely, "" "sincerely," "" "sincerely," "" "knowledgeable", "the guys poured with cakes, biscuits and Bonbons, and is always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority value himself through its perfectionism and its high emotionality that led to Wutational broods.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he did not only cut down with chairs, and threw the mud and screwed down to the ground, but also screwed guys to the hair or ears, he has already given earlier years ago, deeply regrets and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, in order to his honor, however, it must be said that such educators in the fragment period, the 1960s and seventies were widespread, with parents such as teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think of all of us who was born of 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also have this in a secular school, a state-school, experienced."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the irreplaceable sexual abuse and the non-violence at the preschschule, are the detached Bagatelles."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"if you ask yourself, whether it was not with his prominence and his role as a brother of Benedikt XVI., that many media has just rushed to him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"on Bayerischer pope, many who never have understood him nor ever."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report deburdened Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, the report has reported a lot about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger is placed in the final report also some orderling or co-ordination in terms of sexual abuse and load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual grips claims to have become familiar to the domicular champion.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were deconsecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dreamed to speak with my Father or my mother," "said a stranger for the others," "It was all very embarrassing."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is yet that most victims are not silent on the silence.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they don't even familiar with parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader who would have been quite some of the doers of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a survey students formulating it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see any case in which he would have imagined (Georg Ratzinger) timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd, accept that they rested? bubbles intruders or more clearly or more likely to have opened as compared to their parents, dormitory, trust, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "that the students involved in advance and / or their surroundings could not be confirmed in the examination of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus free of any fellow-knowing. "</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus, it cannot be accused, not prevented him or put it to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to reconcile his good name with this resale crime, as it was unfortunately taken in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, there was much of" non-violence "with the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger was thrown away in the report. "</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem, that in the coverage it was mixed and mixed up to a huge melange from sexual abuse and nonviolence and somewhere, in the midst of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is precisely the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, there is always clean separated: between the pre-school and the gymnasium, between sexual abuse and violence, we say once, other benefits."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report describes incidents from the time since 1945, thus also for four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir head of the cathedral."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases, in which lad of sadistile teachers were controlled and malnourished, they opened up at the preschschule in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really scandalous states have to be prevented."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with whom, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, for he got the boys first to face as they were already on the cathedral-place."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on that was, as most witnesses emphasise the subject of" "preschool" "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">"it was just happy to escape, and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even" heavenly. ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the cathedral-playing residence?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" many sacrifices the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases despite violence they even connect with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"at most, a maximum still is the throw away to have washed away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts the report could only define two periods in which he was reported from the states at the preschschule.</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the happenings at a school, where he did not want to hear anything, and then again in 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Wear Georg Ratzinger in front of the stands consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspatzengths, which the report even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"therein he indicates that," "that in the preschool the test should continue to be practiced."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"even in view of the risk of negative press figures, he received urgent progress."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"it was of course at a time when legal clarity existed, as a test case was not forbidden in Bavaria too."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they opened themselves in a legal gray area, just as each one of us still knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"there was also difficult to estimate for him, where those affected may be exaggerated or dramatic, and where really the permitted border had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but you can not say, it would have always been digested."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the filing was officially cancelled in Bavaria too."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said yes, it is unfair to apply today's educational standards to the damaging time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we were talking about the" "pitfalls of the anachronism", "thus the danger to evaluate the past in today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">There the princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but that of course does not apply to sexual abuse that at all times was abominable and also not for what was broken in the preschool of adversity and violence against innocent pediatrists, that goes far beyond that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very awful and I am glad that it is finally up to work.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger in shelter, for all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means for disciplined and punishment, so earing and to drag the hair and ears, were widely used in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as a physical punishment then, it has also strictly kept in it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what picture of his Regensburger time, Georg Ratzinger has given back to you for the book" "My brother of the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the topic test and speak about the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, thus Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, as the Domspatzen played just a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I don't mean that he has led there a stricter Regiment."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even that must be said once again: without this perfectionism, without the undemanding discipline, it would probably be hardly possible to form the national known Regensburger Domspatzen (in 1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991) on tour."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and Bonsaons alone, one does not even make a big singer and face every success in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced for Georg Ratzinger during talks on their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: by working on the book and in addition I met Georg Ratzinger really very well and experienced again as wonderful, humorous, landlords, deep believers, and hearted people, of which one could not imagine that he could possibly have a little or a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regularly coming to him regularly, like many former domains, 23 years after his Emerging, periodically contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him up to the present day, so he was strictly speaking to them, so are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"most Domspatzen are today grateful for him, that he enriched their lives and giving them the world of music."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a stringent father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respect of respect, to which they still look up and to worship them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clear, all that you threejects him are educators, which were then on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is highly unjust, a man, only because he has prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make medial sinners."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the nasty intention, that is behind it, just too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, discharged him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now, the landing stage would have a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria, and maybe even Germany no one would like to know the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
