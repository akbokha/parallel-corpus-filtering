this has made clear the Hollywood star in an interview now in@@ comprehen@@ sible .

Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sport@@ pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf course in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a bit of variety with a horseback riding on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses reminded of her holiday she h@@ unted home in the fast Gal@@ op@@ p home to the feed .
&quot; a kilometer at that pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and with this the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday Germany was best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament experience - again close to horses .
he left himself with his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV on a horse he didn &apos;t stop to photograph himself .
the first time in Aachen and with it was also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Spor@@ th@@ ilfe covered the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small Gala The Golden Sport@@ pyramid .
in awards it lacks the sympath@@ etic ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; Federal Services , Silver &apos;s Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already ened him .
a long is the 18th winner of the Sport@@ pyramid .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; this award signi@@ fies me a lot , &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; for she is not only granted for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring .
and so he gave the price @-@ money from 25,000 Euro to the same .
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ fold US master &apos;s master was recorded on Saturday to the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the excellent include the Ath@@ ath@@ l@@ eten Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard G@@ ien@@ ger , the Ru@@ der Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ eke , the Spring@@ ve Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the Hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard . &quot;
many of these athletes were on Saturday at Aachen .
&quot; after the official part the illustr@@ ates society went into the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza Prize ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger stopped distance to the big animals .
Cl@@ int@@ ons and Tru@@ mp@@ s economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - you want both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; un@@ one , however , the two US presidential elections are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a princi@@ pled , rather philosoph@@ ical difference . &quot;
the role of the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp wants to keep it small in doubt and war@@ ns how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regul@@ arities .
&quot; Clinton wants to increase the economy to death and regulate the world , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself would be quite different from that , maintains the@@ Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely return regulations , and he makes for a wide @-@ ranging tax reform with lower controls , for both private men and businesses . &quot;
&quot; Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged chances and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the tax would increase for the rich , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the mur@@ ders will be invested , Tru@@ mp and Clinton almost wor@@ t@@ ate . &quot;
democratic Candi@@ date announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are strictly ab@@ sent from the state @-@ of the Republi@@ cans of Republi@@ cans .
&quot; therefore , on Tru@@ mp could therefore also come to party discussions . &quot;
&quot; more , the differences in energy and climate policies are evident . &quot;
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal power plants and re @-@ run coal production in the United States .
oil funding is also intended to be possible in so far protected areas to termin@@ ate the Paris climate protection agreement .
&quot; Clinton is aiming for further expanding the renewable energies with its investment programme : &quot; &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away from each other . &quot;
&quot; TP@@ P , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ fish trade agreement , do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the United States do not want to isol@@ ate the USA from international trade , but just to better protect the American jobs . &quot;
&quot; that should then be paid better then , calls for about Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger strike .
it wants to increase it on 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to be , then he says he should not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand is Tru@@ mp , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics say to him , so that the budget deficit would be even bigger . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton is standing at least by the rich , that they pay more taxes and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is part of women who fl@@ ee alone , almost to everyday life . &quot;
when they arrive in Germany they are often traum@@ atis@@ ed .
a house offers refu@@ ge .
in a large kitchen sitting four women .
&quot; each has a baby , which is at most one year old . &quot;
one has put her little son in the arm .
he dot@@ ted with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother sti@@ r on the table @-@ top .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iled short and kis@@ sing the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; it is an area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance services in Bavaria , and deals with the theme of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are whis@@ per@@ ed .
they live in Mün@@ ch@@ ner North in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Family and Mün@@ ch@@ ner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - also not as visitors .
the exception is a w@@ ax@@ mann in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : any woman who arrives here , has made their escape experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men fl@@ ee because of wars because they are politically persec@@ uted , because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a glimp@@ se of Europe . &quot;
&quot; in women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; many ste@@ al away secre@@ tly , because they do not see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced mar@@ riages , honest@@ y or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is driving them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs for instance call for a bottle of water a sexual act is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they anchor in Germany , ir@@ re , told B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; even here , all women in Refu@@ ge@@ es would often be considered a min@@ der@@ ous and worse . &quot;
&quot; this leads to that about 90 percent of women living in the Mu@@ ch@@ ner North , who are trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; some of the children have certainly not come up voluntarily . &quot;
many women are so unusual for they say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t want to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they often do not have to help , need@@ les more accommodations only for them , calls for b@@ aking . &quot;
the seven districts of Bavaria are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
&quot; on the question whether from a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction , we answer some with no . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is something such as some of the governments not . &quot;
&quot; even in Schw@@ aben , women are not separated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Unter@@ - and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are some common shel@@ ters or homes only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women . &quot;
the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men .
&quot; in a study that was published to the committee , it is : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy is missing , men and women are accommod@@ ated together , there may be a constant - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; the washing rooms should be easily accessible and accessible to women , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel of this protective needs , one can read on the thir@@ st , giving it to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has been around for us that there is us , we have a long wa@@ ist , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
it could easily be a second house .
assistance systems : demands for new operating activities
&quot; in the assistance of assistance in Assi@@ stance , their union must be called to use new labour @-@ actions in their disputes relating to a new contract . &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called its entire Council as early as early September for more working measures .
&quot; the J@@ DC spoke out , that it had dre@@ amed of ministers to respond to the concerns of the contract . &quot;
&quot; assistance and medical students have voted in July about the rejection of a contract , which was agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted against the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC cub@@ its Mc@@ Court said the government &quot; &quot; insi@@ sted quiet &quot; &quot; of problems that resulted in that the contract was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; given that the J@@ DC Management Board has asser@@ ted to reject the proposed new contract completely rejected and official re@@ talks to all these concerns . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Management Board has placed an formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to start a continued program escal@@ ating labour operations , which starts at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to that Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists in this year were sixth strike , the first total inci@@ dents in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the BM@@ A Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ thalm@@ ologists Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions , which were recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which were still taken before the vote by 54.@@ 000 assistance and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Jerem@@ y Hunt said that the contract for physicians in England would be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of outside &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
&quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday , in order to give hands the hands and announce an official end for eight months to pro@@ claim the words and economic sanctions . &quot;
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counter@@ part in the golden hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in receiving , I can &apos;t worship the in@@ im@@ print that Ankara wants that Ankara wants that reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the rash , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin heard in sm@@ iles , and he hardly radi@@ ated warmth , even for its backward relations . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly said from his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot;
I could no longer count .
&quot; he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but can even improve . &quot;
&quot; on the next day one newspaper , that Erdo@@ gan would have heard so would never be some worst . &quot;
to me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite to indicate .
&quot; but one of Putin radi@@ ant , sustainable cooling , that the state of Russia had nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his introduc@@ tions : the sealing of a Russian fighter plane at the border of Turkey by Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was w@@ ut@@ ent@@ burned .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to like Russia into the back .
&quot; this was even bigger , because it was committed by a supposed friend . &quot;
Vet@@ r@@ ust rebuild it becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; months long , the state @-@ controlled media led a fier@@ ce , unlimited attack on Ankara . &quot;
at one time it seemed as if the Turks would like to blame for all the blame .
&quot; on the most serious officials , the alleg@@ ations of senior officials , that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s family has benef@@ ited from the illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , which has been controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has denied this veh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it is time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin was killed by the President Erdo@@ gan , which he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the benefits of an c@@ eas@@ e@@ fire are clear on the hand .
Erdo@@ gan takes first and foremost all the friends who can get it after the last month after a failed coup d &apos;@@ i almost his ministry .
repeti@@ tive terrorist attacks in Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number is reduced by nearly 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel agent and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated if the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late rush to the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week forecasts the state of television , cheap fruits and vegetables , once the Turkish agr@@ arian agr@@ arian could be allowed . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti form@@ ulate it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry in the West as the reaction to the tried to consider a weak response .
&quot; in addition , the persistent Gro@@ ll come about the sn@@ ail @-@ accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ping to it from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the west . &quot;
the Russian state of State in Ankara won a bonus that he tried and asked for the elected government bodies in Ankara .
&quot; this is well kept for Moscow , a matter of course , which itself has a profound fear of reg@@ im@@ e@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; meeting in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey , one , as it once would be an an@@ al@@ ysts once described , &quot; &quot; Alliance of foreign executives , &quot; &quot; two countries participating in the West and now feel bad . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently been supporting the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey opposing views . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant , that after nearly three hours of initial discussions , both Presidents told the press conference , that they could not even shed the subject . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey avoided it inten@@ tionally to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to stress this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus that can be found in Syria where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in the face of the potential for a complete disp@@ aster , as NATO member of Turkey repe@@ aled the Russian fighter jet , it is certainly better that the two heads of state will talk at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland is no longer available
the R@@ BS brand needs to be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the board of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with that the brand R@@ BS were connected to the global ambitions of the bank .
the Bank has since dist@@ ancing itself since eight years ago and had to be saved .
&quot; at that time , brand brand@@ ed &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have been used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands brands . &quot;
it supported the international sport with millions of pounds to sponsorship by the Six Nations Rug@@ by to the Wimbledon winner Andy Murray .
but now she decided to put more national brands into the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the headquarters headquarters and the IP@@ O altern@@ ate to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for private customer business , which are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our Invest@@ ors brand , as well as the brand , among which our employees will be busy , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I am saying that we do not pursue global goals , but to pursue local goals . &quot;
&quot; each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different , and our employees will work among these brands with customers . &quot;
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue his Six sponsorship sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the perc@@ ep@@ ability of the various brands in his sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , for how do we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this become a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; the pre @-@ board said . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ fied over three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these marks . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think there will be many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can lan@@ ci@@ ate these marks again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achieved in Pre@@ dil@@ ection with its 3.@@ 000@@ ten win at New@@ market
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ yed champagne after a double at New@@ market that brings him 3.@@ 000@@ ten win
the Jo@@ ck@@ ey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori insured on Friday his 3.@@ 000@@ ten British gain in New@@ market .
&quot; he set on Pre@@ dil@@ ection , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local track record with his second win the night a milestone . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Itali@@ ans is the sixth Jo@@ ck@@ ey , who reached a milestone in the flat @-@ race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ yar , said : &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here
&quot; I am very happy about it to happen at New@@ market , because I am here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ aler Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ ers , when he cat@@ ching the victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection . &quot;
&quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached a milestone in the obstacles race - Jo@@ ck@@ ey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ mal@@ ige winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who finished more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a real @-@ breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the Nin@@ eth Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4.@@ 4@@ 93 Kar@@ rier@@ esi@@ zer &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ck@@ ey of the modern age and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone which only steps forward before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is its tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that differs from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
he is a fantastic amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors for racing , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma enthusiastic fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said to Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already fet@@ ched 6,000 wins if he was not just a weekend and Grand Prix jo@@ ck@@ ey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already been counted in GB for nearly 30 years which is great .
&quot; he has a vibrant personality , which is good for a bri@@ tish race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ck@@ ey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; flying Flying Dis@@ mo@@ unts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of the British flat for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ ory Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug . &quot;
&quot; three years ago he initially had difficulties when he returned from his sixth block , but he showed an impressive characteristic to def@@ y his branches and to return to his final form . &quot;
&quot; and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori has once said before , that he will continue to continue with competitions until his at least 5@@ 0,@@ ten years . &quot;
Russia Putin feu@@ dal St@@ ef Sergei Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has released un@@ expect@@ edly to the St@@ ef Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the narro@@ wer rehabilitation of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to the special representative for environmental and transport affairs .
&quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it is , that Putin has arranged his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been Deputy since 2012 Ivan@@ ov , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tallinn , he made his degree at the renowned State Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in Tokyo &apos;s Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is ( in Russian ) , that he later was the Office of the Government and the Government of the Government . &quot;
he said to Putin : &quot; thanks for your trust . &quot;
&quot; I think that it is the most important task of the government to support their activity as a state of law and controls , and controls the implementation of your instructions . &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov has asked to leave his post and have recommended V@@ ain@@ o as its successor .
to convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putin &apos;s and works like he for the Soviet secret service that K@@ GB .
as St@@ ef he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on TV , claimed both men , that the St@@ ef would withdraw his own desire . &quot;
&quot; but despite the weak@@ ening for the cameras , here are just a few of them - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
here is the result of a kind of power ?
this currently knows no one .
&quot; but the official statement - that a man who was once announced as a potential president , at once , I would like to direct the Russian environmental policy - came across big scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks on Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; &quot; Ivan@@ ov &quot; &quot; is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - compl@@ ained post four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
&quot; previously , he was Deputy Minister @-@ Minister and Defense . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin &apos;s former member of State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Council ( FSB ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his dep@@ uty . &quot;
&quot; when Putin called his power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , he most familiar . &quot;
once it was believed that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia as a third term of Putin &apos;s opposition against the Constitution .
&quot; but this post was taken by another , approaching allies , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became prime minister before joining the president three and a half years later .
&quot; Criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son , after he proposed producer &quot;

Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers have joined the Nord@@ deck of the Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - which means the bridge now is connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four con@@ cluding the &quot; cover &quot; , &quot; which is the completion of approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the ram@@ p section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 ton .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 Sch@@ rä@@ g@@ sei@@ le . &quot;
the £ 1,35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; at Keit@@ h Brown , Keit@@ h Brown is a visit to the site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment at the construction of the Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineer of a truly ep@@ tic degree in this project , with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel which alone were used for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the Br@@ ück@@ ende@@ ck is a delicate activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , nearly 79 % of the total brid@@ ge@@ ars are in their place and the last section of Dec@@ ks gets today in Ros@@ y@@ th a bed for the deck , which means the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first verse represents a significant milestone in every place project . &quot;
in this fantastic project the decision @-@ orient@@ ated state @-@ of @-@ art and deep @-@ construction represents .
&quot; after the installation of the last road level and its connection with the north @-@ deck area , we had to close the even existing gap on the north or country side . &quot;
this was reached by pul@@ ling the northern exit bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , as the vi@@ adu@@ ct 222 meters long is , ca . 6,000 tons weighs and at a incl@@ ination of about 3 % to be pulled up . &quot;
&quot; delicate , since the toler@@ ances , to which the team works , tiny , - on every page they are be@@ ating only a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue at the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; happiness to be alive &quot;

who builds the Braunschweig favorable apartments ?
&quot; in future , the SPD and Green mean : investors should become much stronger in the future . &quot;
how does one react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 apartments in the coming years ?
&quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; . &quot; &quot;
yet arguments is programmed .
first of all about the question : who should build the favorable apartments actually ?
a regulation is lacking so far .
&quot; CEO Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas in future , must prove 20 percent of all the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be developed in the stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the big force point in the city hall is , however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you want investors to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors in such areas at least 10 percent , but as 20 percent of the apartments build as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban residential construction program , which will cost millions of costs and will still be financed to provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U will make investors possible as few regulations as possible .
the left does not want to keep rough@@ ness for investors .
&quot; regardless of this , Brat@@ mann , b@@ ah@@ t is a tight@@ ening of the situation on the residence market . &quot;
&quot; when the concept of action is implemented , it will ensure additional tasks in the construction management . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the specialists .
&quot; but still the program is not entirely : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how do you compare the loss of other approximately 1300 apartments , whose promotion will run out in the coming years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , the plan@@ atory @-@ policy speaker of Nicole Palm , should now be purchased at the current Bin@@ dings from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to get back again into the price connection . &quot;
this is possible in the west city .
one fell s@@ woo@@ p to solve the problem .
&quot; for in the West city , the end of the year is run out . &quot;
about 1800 apartments you could get there back to the prices for cheap apartments .
only : we do not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; for example , the number of social housing in the west city has dramatically increasing , be removed from the goal of the so @-@ called diar@@ rhe@@ a . &quot;
&quot; there should be a concentration of social weak in only a few city districts , there should be no more . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens anticip@@ ates that there will be even movement in the discussion .
&quot; CEO Holger Her@@ lit@@ ch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a large majority , the CD@@ U must go to the boat . &quot;
this is focused on more construction sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not yet be found .
&quot; Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; that teenagers and child for playing no longer go outside but rather it prefer to spend their leisure time , on screens , was lam@@ ented in the last decade of many . &quot;
&quot; at Po@@ k@@ emon Go , it is about getting people from the sofa and to become more active . &quot;
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and most recently to smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; of course , I refer to the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app , based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 199@@ 0@@ ies ( later developed from it a cartoon animations , game cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; as many phenomena of Pop@@ culture s@@ ank the interest in the release of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July . &quot;
the launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within a few days Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go more users as Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players will go out with their smartphone outside and search for Po@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are tr@@ acked by a GPS and once they were found &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; ( via a screens@@ hot on the phone ) or &quot; &quot; captured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined the s@@ ahn and sp@@ rang out for the look of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the U.S. , the game led to a considerable rise in steps that passes the &quot; average &quot; person every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ og@@ ram , an app for Apple Watch , which followed by 35.@@ 000 users , the number of messages followed , the number of re@@ followed people , which hit each day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 per cent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for performance enhancement .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to bring about 30 minutes to take &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; every day to be active &quot; , &quot; because many public messages are boring and people come , the miserable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; who drives regularly sports , reduces its chances to treat cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonderful at Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , that they are fun . &quot;
&quot; thus three pillars of health cover - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
&quot; as always , there are also Moravian Game ri@@ bs , which must always complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what should it be ?
it has been a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smart phone apps like Fit@@ Bit had already been able to follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its charm and the use will be repeated by time .
&quot; because of Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite in the Apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ations in the real world and to help with many people on the hunt , more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es is on all the im@@ mu@@ n .

and now finally Olympi@@ ast@@ eg@@ ress finally .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ year American Tur@@ ner in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for the multi @-@ day title and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all eyes among the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
&quot; your overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ er@@ kam@@ er@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ a@@ ist Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the Americ@@ an@@ ists Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the Swedish sea during the single multi @-@ campaign during the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth heter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American , which wins a multi @-@ title title , and overall the fifth , while she has fes@@ ed their reputation to be the best of their generation or even ever . &quot;
&quot; it broke out in tears , as their end result was shown and her long journey in that moment was an end . &quot;
this success is represented in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
&quot; Bil@@ es the last three years have domin@@ ates its sport game - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympi@@ ast@@ eg@@ ress from 1984 Mary Lou Rett@@ on by her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast , which I ever saw . &quot;
&quot; it was expecting a final examination in Brazil , a competition which went not so much between it and the rest of athletes , but rather between it and a load @-@ dimension@@ ed expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be regarded as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americ@@ an@@ ists Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace taking gold and silver in the individual multi @-@ campaign during the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while it served at the f@@ arewell party that served at the ongoing team co@@ ordin@@ ates in Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a exhaust mani@@ fold . &quot;
&quot; although cheap it existed , during its long departure to the top , never planned the future is not really true . &quot;
part of her soil exercises - which contain their typical tum@@ bling pass - is matched to Latin American music that would match home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , which was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school flight to the gymn@@ asium , in the Bo@@ or@@ man , became a force . &quot;
&quot; she has not lost a multi @-@ end competition since the summer of 2013 , a winning series that will last as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ af@@ ina led through two screen@@ ings , thr@@ ust the image . &quot;
sul@@ p@@ sich@@ ord and bo@@ dent@@ ures - in which Bil@@ es does the World Championship - lau@@ ded .
she fet@@ ched up with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the float again - and sat down with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man um@@ arm@@ ingly gently as she expected her en@@ su@@ ing - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow to Bil@@ es sh@@ iny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision , which she once described in their collection @-@ book , to reality . &quot;
&quot; the power Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medals in a Ti@@ eb@@ r@@ ake to Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year team capit@@ ols , which is called by the Americans &quot; O@@ ma &quot; , &quot; a lead . &quot;
&quot; after their ground exercise , she cast the audience to bo@@ oths , overcome by a com@@ eback , that sometimes dou@@ bt@@ ful appeared . &quot;
&quot; as it is concerned , the T@@ we@@ et of 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning of this week from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims in mass @-@ fall at the music festival in the car
&quot; to the police reporting that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot in one of the deadly attacks since a decade in the first series of series of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Lin@@ er , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in an entry . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator was moist@@ ened out of a cell phone , while he stood on the car side of the car and fled afterwards with another vehicle , is to read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police dealt with that the thre@@ e@@ fold murder does not seem to be the result of a car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , since the att@@ acker doesn &apos;t have the hand@@ bags or the $ 2.@@ 900 , who took possession of an adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the Poli@@ z@@ eis@@ pre@@ cher by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting had a closer look at it , a closer look at whether they are connected with four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , predominantly in H@@ isp@@ anic residen@@ ces were killed seven people in nine attacks by seven people and two others have been in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , distributed Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , an affiliate of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ ll@@ ac or Lincoln . &quot;
&quot; the investig@@ ators refuse to off@@ end the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked , and were committed by the same mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized due to their injury and died later . &quot;
&quot; Lin@@ er , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on the spot . &quot;
witness the police with that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was desc@@ ended on an empty picnic up truck half an hour before the thir@@ st murder , and from that it is assumed that it was the work of the serial production . &quot;
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ es and insured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as ball @-@ frag@@ ments from the engine space .
&quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old likes Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto the singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of his Alter@@ aries has Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto was nothing knew during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time , my first thought I managed not . &quot;
I don &apos;t want this .
I did not let myself go .
&quot; what is not true -- of course one has left on it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; your husband Vincent and her has been told that Ed@@ mund they may never recognize them under circumstances , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors were even so far that they sm@@ ashed him .
&quot; my first answer to that &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a wal@@ ker .
Ed@@ mund was unable to sit back up to his third year and he can still not speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
he can run with support and cycle cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language that Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please sing me something ahead . &quot;
&quot; we bring him drawing &quot; , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical language language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as mas@@ ons or the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it is influenced by the life of the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of an un@@ certain future .
I asked constantly what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
&quot; for a long time I did not ask for a progn@@ osis for a long time , because I do not expect that someone can truly say to me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

one of the 29 @-@ year men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in the stable state .
&quot; the boy was built on the front seat of a car along with the 29 year @-@ old , who is in a critical state , reported on the transm@@ itter . &quot;
&quot; the other two victims were not found in the car and police , whether under one of the last men of the perpet@@ rators could be . &quot;
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to come into a cross @-@ fire between several guns .
pat@@ ron@@ es for Stur@@ m@@ ust@@ hon@@ ors who were trac@@ ed to different Stur@@ ges were over@@ se@@ ated the scene .
it seems that this is clearly a long battle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the trail , found H@@ ül@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; so it seems to have existed here several armed fighters that were very active involved , &quot; shared police di@@ ap@@ nea Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di police in Philadelphia . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles made in the area .
there was no strongh@@ olds and the police currently review according to reports according to the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ year girls was hit by a cross @-@ chair on the arm as she played in front of her house in the neighborhood of the West O@@ ak Lane .
she recovered and the police are still looking for a susp@@ ects .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie need &quot;
that is what I prepare myself among the women &apos;s oly@@ mp@@ tions in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that is out of more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I have been doing so heavily since 1984 with every summer Olympics , and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ ast , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspir@@ es for many young girls from other color @-@ color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din , and Madison Ko@@ cian , the cath@@ o@@ lic@@ in is , ab@@ round , makes every pride . &quot;
this team finally reflects the United States .
it has been the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one under the feminine female was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americ@@ anism .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ ag@@ ew@@ inner and America che@@ ered .
&quot; now the world was able to witness of the incredible performance of the World Championships in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as she was unexpected , but master@@ ful g@@ ym@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Simone the fourth , heter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American , was won in an individual martial event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are witness@@ ing the top of this sport , but thus do not see rotation classes in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie suggested all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison to create it to the oly@@ mp@@ ic team . &quot;
&quot; you are the &quot; &quot; Five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympics are only four tur@@ ers in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is clear that exercising is a more expensive sport and turbine in first line in private trainers , which are maintained by parents which pay for training , furniture , travel and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ ast and families ) . the list can be continued . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ key lies in af@@ flu@@ ent pre@@ locations that can support the business .
&quot; in these verses , the tur@@ ner will receive their whole training and that is a more expensive and long @-@ term commitment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Train@@ ers from Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ er von Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both trained their athletes , since they started exercising . &quot;
&quot; we must make the congreg@@ ations au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a high @-@ powerful and easy accessible rotation . &quot;
I have founded my turn@@ it@@ ement of 20 years .
&quot; with my events , we have offered free and affordable prices in Harlem for about 15.000 ur@@ b@@ ane teenagers ( above all black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) , and national and international awards . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high quality gymn@@ as@@ tics who deserve the opportunity to learn from this great oly@@ mp@@ ic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ ants for the mind . &quot;
this combination provides vital benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team to bring thousands of young girls to interest for the gymn@@ as@@ tics , and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such a exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the oly@@ mp@@ ic Mann@@ es@@ gol@@ ds and thank you that motiv@@ ates so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ thalm@@ ologists would like to organize further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y H@@ unts proposal
&quot; the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes due to the adoption of a reform@@ ist contract with the Func@@ tion@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists who voted against him in a choice . &quot;
&quot; in July Hunt plans reveals to introduce the contract , and said that the N@@ HS would be harmful in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and any further delay for employees and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first Assi@@ stance atri@@ cians should receive a new contract , the changes to night@@ stand and weekend work to improve the care of legislative movements . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chairman of the BM@@ A Committee on Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ thalm@@ ologists said the last night in a communication with : &quot; Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ thalm@@ ologists on the proposed agreement as before serious concerns , in particular that it will treat the current staff crisis and treat it to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; only eight weeks which still remain , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , will need to be made progress and time runs out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to solve the disputes between discussions sti@@ ces in the government for the sake of resistance and sometimes on re@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this happened one of us , the Jerem@@ y Hunt had made it last month that his door would always be open . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Hunt is now taking action to up@@ lift the penetration and speak the concerns of assistance and assistance .
&quot; if he did not do this , they have clearly understood the assistance systems that they are ready to carry out more labour @-@ actions . &quot;
&quot; the last strike end of April saw a surge of almost 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates , since n@@ urses and experts have been included to provide doctors on the strike . &quot;
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the reform@@ ist contract with the Func@@ tion@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A seeks better vo@@ wage compensation for the 54.@@ 000 assistance agencies , which are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director of the N@@ HS employees , called Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ thalm@@ ologists on the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; labour measures reached nothing of the only little , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , car@@ egi@@ vers and their families only worries , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; over the past two months , we have talked to the comb@@ at@@ ee of Assi@@ stance and related to the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries positively to concerns about the beliefs and wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ low@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; employers hop@@ ed that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses for those who were about training courses , training courses and the gender Ministry regarding compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per t@@ ing@@ - drug that can reduce the heart attack
thousands of heart cancer patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ pro @-@ day drug after the authorities have been recommended to ad@@ minister this more people for a longer period .
the in@@ experienced medicine T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart attack for people with a her@@ edit@@ ary disease .
&quot; the drug is administ@@ ered for 12 months after a heart attack , thus reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack . &quot;
the Reg@@ ulations nice of the N@@ HS has recommended a 4 year long intake to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the Reg@@ ulations nice of the N@@ HS has recommended a 4 year long intake to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; approximately 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart @-@ coloured and stroke are caused by accumul@@ ations of fatty material in the arter@@ ies walls .
&quot; if the bom@@ b@@ ag breaks , it may cause a cl@@ ot@@ inn@@ amon that causes the blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ot is dis@@ sol@@ dered , it can flow through blood stream and viol@@ ate the blood flow towards the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
individuals who already had a heart attack at a higher risk are subject to another risk .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is distributed under the merch@@ ant Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ auses in@@ likely . &quot;
&quot; the conduc@@ tivity of nice who has been published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of the nice health evaluation centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons , who suffered a heart attack , a further heart attack or a stroke - often with des@@ al@@ ous consequences . &quot;
the fear of renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing other heart @-@ coloured and stroke among people is already having a heart attack .
&quot; by a provisional recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are glad that we are able to extend the available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
information on the effectiveness and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the blood risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the conduc@@ tivity does not recommend treatment that goes beyond this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness makes electoral sc@@ ams in Muslim regions
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year at the dism@@ iss@@ al of a government report because of corruption from the ministry .
a culture of Political Cor@@ si@@ ness has led to that widespread electoral amo@@ unted to Muslim communities is kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored as a crus@@ hing government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es attacks the police , electoral ob@@ serving and Rath@@ ouses to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to Eth@@ nie and Religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and Communist government , which is now such an antagon@@ ism , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that there must be the police to def@@ aul@@ ted deport@@ ations outside of electoral kab@@ inen , to inti@@ mid@@ ated voters . &quot;
it recommends that voters should lead to a badge in order to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at present , a voters must merely call its name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests , not even remot@@ ely ink on the finger of a person , if they dis@@ agree their choices , to prevent somebody twice . &quot;
wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers should preserve more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he ur@@ ges the press should have more access to the municipal premises and decisions of non @-@ minist@@ ries or working groups .
&quot; this is not only for electoral fraud , but also the municipal government is intended to protect against the broad@@ ening corruption and financial investment culture , which goes by it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by the Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets Deb@@ sk@@ and@@ als in eastern London .
&quot; last year , a special court op@@ ted that the acting Mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man after a L@@ itan@@ ei should be contained in corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the court was that Rah@@ man had per@@ ished the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in z@@ yn@@ ical manner , &quot; that he could have brought his critics with seg@@ reg@@ ression and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man should &quot; &quot; have led his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ ig@@ ous duty of Muslims , to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful , or the result of a im@@ itation , when one person cho@@ oses another . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there would be no proof of fraud throughout the country .
he expressed particularly alar@@ ming for frau@@ dul@@ ating letter - when the older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to s@@ quar@@ ry the electoral system , including the leaders to prove their identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; as proof was attached that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercis@@ ed , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the Will of the Elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ean or ban@@ qu@@ ite background . &quot;
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions such a behavior due to &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to the eth@@ ni@@ cally and religion would have been ignored . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations in order to rip the system , including the pro@@ hibition that political activists is to process to stop &quot; &quot; choices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration deadline , in order to prevent the electoral sub@@ directory to immigration and social concrete purposes . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before the election according to your credit .
&quot; not remote si@@ sted on the finger of a person use , as soon as they released their voice to prevent somebody cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
systematic check @-@ ups on the nationality of a person perform to ensure that they are entitled to either .
a three @-@ year limitation on moti@@ ons on an automatic letter .
pro@@ hibition that political activ@@ ist complete letter and covers from brief@@ case work .
the police force the authority to set deport@@ ations around voting stations .
&quot; a legislative change , which facilit@@ ates an indic@@ t@@ ment for inti@@ mid@@ ation according to the representation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s representatives in 1983 ) . &quot;
photographer in voting stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the constitu@@ tionally ( except for Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , to make sure the staff can assert that voters go alone in the electoral cabins . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; that after the Tower of Ham@@ lets , there was no pen@@ al code . &quot;
&quot; the El@@ ective Court has proclaimed Lut@@ for Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty for because of a L@@ itan@@ ism of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , it has been noted , according to the high demands in the criminal proceedings - guilty . &quot;
he also criti@@ ci@@ zed the effective &quot; bott@@ ling controls &quot; of the Town Hall .
&quot; Sir Eric stated : &quot; &quot; the court part in Tower Ham@@ lets from the last year was a warning signal . &quot;
&quot; our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of the parli@@ aments , but the worrying and covered spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Dou@@ vers in and other famous Doppel@@ gänger written by Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ ists in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are celebrated this week over the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot out of border and band who has appeared to be an impressive col@@ ori in the Du@@ chess heart of Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by far not the only thing about Gold fighting , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not , if you must give faith social media . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ our@@ ing the Olympic Games in Rio and all of the famous faces , created at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a list of Olympi@@ oni@@ ken , which have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Dutch . &quot;
&quot; the hunters and the wolf : member of the US team in Arch@@ ery Br@@ ady Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ates Dou@@ sen in the Rad@@ ren@@ n@@ bahn , many people are bound to the internet , like a certain ar@@ cher of the Twin Towers from A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team in Arch@@ ery Br@@ ady Ell@@ ison has caused a storm on Twitter after pictures , on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ hei@@ tly . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the arch@@ ery got the ins@@ anity in social media and gave to that he has been hearing from his childhood since he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I see no big simil@@ arity with the exception of the facial hair , divided Br@@ ady of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post with . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I feel at ease as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly enter the centre stage : the all@@ u@@ bi@@ ous simil@@ arity between the British Weit@@ inger Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eyes shall be able to go through the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
and in the swimming pool the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared to the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
a course higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
another decent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett who pointed out very heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medals in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sunrise skin and bl@@ on@@ den hair like the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ Cor@@ d to be att@@ ested during the American Nathan Adrian H Lev@@ itt .
&quot; strong Women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ penter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes &quot;
&quot; not the only thing : a Twitter user was very happy about it , that other the simil@@ arities are also noticed . &quot;
theory into the space : according to this user there is a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple perhaps a reason
&quot; a Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in declared their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ penter are almost identical . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the U.S. football club Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ penter an incredibly similar facial form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ Jenn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical with the actress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal in Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , which resem@@ bles its own beautiful , wide smile , which resem@@ bles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle . &quot;

&quot; the comm@@ ent@@ ator Byr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ alds thought that his microphone would be off @-@ off , when he stro@@ ve his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ don@@ ald , who had been fet@@ ched into the commentary of the C@@ BS , to give more &apos; color &apos; , you could hear say : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the union , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , from as M@@ ief , died like a pig . &quot;

&quot; the critic@@ isms against Byr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , with which many of whom made him talk . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users stopped not back when they heard , as uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel Byr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was &quot;

&quot; short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC show , live for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment was scre@@ ened over a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate chosen specification , we are sorry that it is happening . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BC exc@@ used at the end of more than 90 times in the people , which responded to the Not@@ ice on Twitter &quot;
the commentary in Scott Rus@@ sel had to be ap@@ olog@@ ised in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology at more than 90 other Twitter users who had informed about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network ap@@ ologi@@ zed also quickly and gave a message out .
&quot; we regret it sincerely , that these statements were made and that it was possible that they are broadcast . &quot;
we felt very soon at our audit@@ ors on the show and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ ies in the social media .
&quot; to clarify one , Byr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mmer@@ in , and not to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate chosen specification . Byr@@ on does this what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald announced at the show and tried to justify his remarks by saying that it was not his intention that she is designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment for a moment to rec@@ ap@@ ologi@@ ze me for the comment that I have made staff@@ el after the women &apos;s staff@@ ing staff@@ el in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ is@@ me , he said . &quot;

&quot; the buyer did not know where to see , when a woman moved their clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try sub@@ p@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation they looked , as she saw in it , she moved out and put them back into the shelf . &quot;
they travelled further and tried four pairs of under@@ p@@ ants in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Center in Folk@@ estone in which the woman tasted the under@@ p@@ ants before they put them back into the shelf
&quot; a mother of two children , Jenn@@ y Davi@@ dson , who had tried at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , she was set again and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; in the middle of the sales area , they took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants from the out@@ lay , moved their own ti@@ ghts and p@@ ants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a little discreet place to do it - she was just there , just like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; each star@@ ing , when they passed the shelter again , which you obviously not liked because they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three more dem@@ ons , before she finally decided that ye fell down again and went down again . &quot;
&quot; she did not seem to inter@@ fere , that she ob@@ s@@ wor@@ ded someone - or think about the person who would buy those who had tried them . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; like rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ant to think that somebody would take back home anyone who had another person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Mrs Davi@@ dson said , &quot; How I got , have the employees trying to pull the garments from the sale after she went - what is so good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ p@@ ants to go home and find out that another woman had it and returned again and they were not washed away .
&quot; a speaker of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is himself in the incident , who is on Tuesday , 9 of August in our branches in Folk@@ stone . &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a in front of arms
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail.com could make it safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we spoke with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to handle armed pre@@ dator . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or back in the back , this video will show you how to shoot the sp@@ out for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; if one crosses you from the back then you should see yourself as a first step , so that you can see your att@@ acker and embar@@ k from the line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
grab the weapon then between your front and your shoulder before you hit him with your free Ell@@ bow .
&quot; then hit him with the knee into the cor@@ p@@ est and twi@@ sting , while the att@@ acker thre@@ w up pain , the weapon from his hands . beat it with the run into the face and move back down , while they turn the weapon upon him . &quot;
&quot; with att@@ ackers that approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the shade , grab the weapon and turn it , so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; simultaneously shift the weight to the gun and beat the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the gun out of his handle before they move back and set the weapon upon it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it runs Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; however , remember that it is at a smo@@ b on the safest one is to over@@ pass your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master . &quot;

&quot; but the experiment made under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; , &quot; brought some surprising results to day@@ light . &quot;
&quot; the thought to det@@ ects the dishwasher , which was already used by thousands , but actually are in a kitchen sink more poor bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals across the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he tasted , more than a bad neigh@@ bor in the mouth . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right was known for testing the res@@ ili@@ ence of his intest@@ ine by traveled through the world and ate peculi@@ ar and wonderful things .
&quot; from public funds to rail stations through to dishwasher , the task presented its immune system definitely below a sample &quot;
&quot; he told him : &quot; &quot; as a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mu@@ ddy water . &quot;
in the film he was able to do justice to his reputation .
&quot; the only thing he exp@@ ires , was a narrow public toilet in Russia . &quot;
his trial @-@ line showed a l@@ umin@@ ometer of over 4000 units .
&quot; in comparison to this , the L@@ umin@@ om@@ eters are fresh in fresh hands less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to det@@ ectors , after their L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ s over 4000 units was , while fresh hands reported one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the Reis@@ ef@@ il@@ m &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number at different locations like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; This comes the worst of what I have in a toilet ger@@ chen , near . &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I will find here nothing here because it is inside here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ date .
&quot; the Company holds Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ d Ge@@ fil@@ us , which includes both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says , &quot; We wanted to give consumers something new to consumers . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at the picture and at the same time the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings through , that end@@ ent that we said , &quot; Let us call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the meaning of the intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
&quot; the growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way . &quot;
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the director of the film , added : &quot; let me tell me so - I would have had my respect for Ian , who would have suffered from him , just like the ek@@ ee@@ able Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to her , she dot@@ ted and others to which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad we recorded some of these dirty goodies to film .
&quot; in one of the survey carried out from 2015 Associ@@ ated 84 percent of all respon@@ dents lac@@ tic acid bacteria , particularly with the well @-@ being of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal and intest@@ ine and 58 percent spoke that they do at least occasionally use products that include bei@@ ge @-@ lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
A@@ social family destro@@ ys Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation Soci@@ o in S@@ alt@@ ash Corn@@ wall
&quot; a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left her p@@ enthouse after a delay with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 because it had become terr@@ ori@@ zed their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were cast after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were driven by their property , so were sho@@ cked the property of the apartment con@@ federation in a ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls reported cl@@ owns holes , wood di@@ elen have been opened , gar@@ bage was scattered on the floor and gr@@ aff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls . &quot;
the family were surrounded and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall Housing : she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare and I believe that people do not have to live in this way . &quot;
&quot; there are many things to consider , since this property is probably considered not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is mountainous and its reputation is it also .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that had inserted the family , tr@@ ap@@ pers with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ y@@ sers , inti@@ mid@@ ation of an@@ om@@ ers , drug abuse and excessive scre@@ ams , strings and flu@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , was given an order for anti @-@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which is under circumstances be demol@@ ished , old gar@@ bage was found &quot;
&quot; they were tr@@ aded in the property , which were tr@@ aded in the past drugs , the timber has been opened . &quot;
&quot; neighbours said that they saw them on the street and regularly called the police , &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ o@@ gi@@ erte her and her partner the week by the property , after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to voluntarily make up voluntarily . &quot;
&quot; the dolph@@ in were che@@ ered by light@@ ened neighbors , that said that their lives was made to hell . &quot;
&quot; one said : &quot; &quot; they refused to anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
&quot; the countless times , which we say the police here are amazing . &quot;
&quot; today , tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood on because it was so quiet - we are not used !
&quot; now , where they are finally away , it will be beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Neigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it had been administ@@ ered by the local authorities to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police have been launched at regular intervals , 20 years long . &quot;
on the over@@ grown side of the community house were tr@@ aded gar@@ bage and old toys .
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that it is given the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behavior and the family , as a del@@ gi@@ val is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , because the behavior was extremely difficult and their works for their neighbours had to be horrible . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community , who have walked to us and have provided the information to us . &quot;
I hope that this development is going to con@@ sol@@ ation by some neighbours and the message is given that anti @-@ social behavior will not be toler@@ ated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but they all were over 20 . &quot;
a narrow mattress that leaves inside one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ gi@@ ment on the ground
&quot; workers of the household management are now to have sor@@ berge , which surround the house . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and took place over 70@@ g cannabis as well as orph@@ ans , par@@ ap@@ ans and cash at the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don was granted a fine sentence after they had been guilty of pos@@ sessions of a drug of class B in merch@@ ant .
&quot; they said that the money for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee skel@@ don was , who was killed in an automobile accident in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; after they were without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner will now live in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many rooms of the house were lubric@@ ated with gr@@ aff@@ iti .
&quot; the police says that she will not be a ten@@ ant , which does not hold out to the house order . &quot;
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall shared with that the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication has a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who don &apos;t hold out to the house order .
&quot; this goes to those who can think that they may accept herself without self @-@ alleg@@ ations , as well as those who were damaged by such behavior , &quot; she said . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall is never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities .

&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record alone , between the sentences and at time @-@ outs , they had no co@@ aches . &quot;

Donald Tru@@ mp Ver@@ t ″ enormous problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US republi@@ cans is pl@@ agues by massive worries , also in the traditionally conservative federal states present their majority . &quot;
presidential and Donald Tru@@ mp now gave weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Utah .
&quot; a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ m@@ ust@@ y and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire is something like concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after he cast 16 ri@@ vals from the race in his own Republi@@ can camp , the doubt grow in his success in the battle for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have vast problems in Utah , &quot; said Tru@@ mp in front of evangel@@ icals , which he asked for support in important federal states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; guilt - wrong reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he took up his well @-@ known media . &quot;
Republi@@ can Hoch@@ bur@@ ns
Utah is usually a secure bank for the republi@@ cans .
&quot; according to a survey of Surv@@ ey@@ USA from June , Tru@@ mp and his coun@@ ten@@ ance of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , as well . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp is in front of Tru@@ mp , but not by far from the distance , which is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the Federal State . &quot;
as endangered also Arizona and Georgia .
&quot; in an interview with the CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp answered Tru@@ mp &apos;s question , as he wants to stop the eve of Cl@@ int@@ ons : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and whether back : this will be &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
&quot; he do not make anything else , as &quot; &quot; the truth to tell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich for him at the end of the political correctness , be the right , said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to Press@@ views , the Party of Tru@@ mp should have taken preced@@ ed , funds to support his election campaign , he should not present any better survey values . &quot;
instead of taking the candidates of the Republi@@ can for Congress stronger among the arms .

&quot; the World Association IA@@ AF has raised the I@@ OC for information about the case to use its own exam@@ inations , distributed a IA@@ AF speaker . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the I@@ OC the IA@@ AF will make a review , it says in a IA@@ AF statement . &quot;

&quot; those who does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed caffeine , &quot; says the replacement of the Goo@@ ds @-@ near Foundation Dialog and the world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in short term , the Kur@@ dish municipality of Germany counts on short notice with tens of thousands of preser@@ ves from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; some hundreds of thousand &quot; , &quot; believes the Chief Executive Officer Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; because of the hard work of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish municipality is expected to be a mass c@@ urs@@ ed to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of thousands , in the medium term with some hundreds of thousands of en@@ seek@@ ers from Turkey into Germany when Erdo@@ gan regime is fighting the minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; says Chief Executive Officer Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government has passed over a few months ago against criminal off@@ ences , 500,000 Kurds in Turkey were on the run . &quot;
after the ver@@ tex put@@ sch still sec@@ ular and op@@ position@@ ethnic bur@@ ken are added .
many will begin to re@@ start in Europe if they will be suppres@@ sed in Turkey .
&quot; it may not be that a state that took refugees , in own country of refugees , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the association was accused of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
in this way Erdo@@ gan would raise the departure to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradi@@ cated in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U member . &quot;
&quot; the association was called for the Federal Government to have positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its followers . &quot;
also in Germany I find a &quot; Hex@@ en@@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics .
in the last months I did not feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the freight @-@ movement has also been the escape of many Turks .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the fires as a wagon p@@ endant and other academ@@ ics work the professional existence .
&quot; those who does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed caffeine , inci@@ dentally , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the World . &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reported on the figures of the Federal Ministry of Finance , the Turks already reported the biggest group of asylum for political persecution in Germany before the coup d . &quot;
&quot; to date , 30 . June these are 11.@@ 386 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all accepted as the asylum entitled ( 39.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , there are not those before war , poverty or the de@@ ath@@ less@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , so by state @-@ side , individually persec@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; then go , where it does &quot;
&quot; stran@@ ger Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing of the summer campaign against - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ p@@ hal@@ ia , not to choose the country &apos;s day . &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern you have understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the country &apos;s selection will not be reached directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for stupid now it is not : summer holidays , He@@ at and Land@@ tag@@ sw@@ ahl@@ enburg - this is the case . &quot;
the locals that are to be convinced by the campaigns are on vacation .
&quot; most vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country are on Us@@ edom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not a locals , so may not choose the country &apos;s day . &quot;
&quot; practical problems come : in the holidays are hel@@ pers who hang on posters , bal@@ lo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , and end up voices , fl@@ ags only lab@@ ev@@ oll . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and the last F@@ eri@@ ent@@ ag , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to go out of its own battle in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; the hot stage , if one can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U @-@ coalition must be afraid of his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , lies in surveys clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; exciting , how strongly new@@ com@@ er Af@@ ro@@ cuts and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ able left . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 government re@@ ef , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tr@@ usive electoral campaign , one sees from his big data . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the land , spread ros@@ es and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as it was already the legendary wor@@ t@@ car@@ ger predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did . &quot;
otherwise you get sailors with cold feet and gives ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel the blame at the flo@@ wering of Af@@ D .
&quot; your refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; We created this &quot; &quot; I acceler@@ ates the rise of the right wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its top @-@ channel data , the Interior Lor@@ enz Caf@@ fier , has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place . &quot;
she invited her ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel to great con@@ vic@@ tions ; Merkel parliament is on the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group does not stand , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ p@@ hal@@ ia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ burger and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other Länder , the Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
but it is too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany once Angela Merkel listen .
&quot; otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U largely reno@@ unce the usual choices on market positions and shopping centers with umbr@@ ellas and air bal@@ lo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this , as Kok@@ ert , play only a &quot; &quot; minor role &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also lifted up the base that their country has pl@@ ast@@ ed the base to find itself very narrow , to find a dragon to the people again . &quot;
&quot; you are like the Left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the lands of the country hardly any other . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U campaigns Kok@@ ert on his co @-@ meeting is also self @-@ reve@@ aling : &quot; they need to go there , namely where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden W@@ ed@@ dings , any birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because a lot is standing on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD to a particularly dedicated campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and only shortly before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD had still clearly won at 35,@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Green , petty @-@ party with seven percent in the surveys , are likely to create the jump into the country &apos;s day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue of the holidays in need of a modern virtue and put up their choice of election in the internet .
&quot; online @-@ election campaign , &quot; calls it the president Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green campaigns stand on Sp@@ ur@@ en@@ hunt for native stimulation among the tourists . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top crane teaching , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at by the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ burg@@ ische lakes and finds it still beautiful . &quot;
&quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; election in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 Re@@ furb@@ ishment : Gast@@ ric@@ ts suffer from Sper@@ tion
&quot; at the speed , with which the B 27 stops , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , starting at 5.@@ 30 o &apos;clock in the morning and only at 8 pm , there are all enth@@ used praise . &quot;
&quot; they have made everything quite delicate , &quot; &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff at the jet gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no draw@@ backs .
&quot; the construction site could be picked up at weekends , as planned by the end of October , until the end of October everything is supposed to be ready . &quot;
&quot; the subject will also be praised for the construction work , approximately when it comes to setting up the facility . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site started on Monday to south , and also the block@@ age of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße was lifted in Of@@ ter@@ dingen and thus also the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has been restored , the traffic situation has been relaxed within the place . &quot;
the citizens can now go back from Of@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 again .
the traffic @-@ traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there was partly considerable complaints , &quot; says the chief management of the refurb@@ ishment management of the executive director Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach@@ k@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many sc@@ iss@@ ors were looking for and rather their Nav@@ i trusted as the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to that man@@ cher trucks in residential areas is fran@@ k .
&quot; as well , the speed constraints were not observed , the community also called to sing the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were significant acquisitions , &quot; says King , who made itself on location above the location . &quot;
two to three per minute have been rep@@ lied .
the fastest was on the way with 77 km / hour driving in the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
&quot; since the construction site is moved , it has become more quiet . &quot;
for the busin@@ ess@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg is now open the road again .
busin@@ es@@ spe@@ ople are not happy to look into the cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment has led to them in sales armament , everybody can ask the one asks . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , for which the refurb@@ ishment has barely consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; most slight fall &quot; , &quot; but also a that of course is missing &quot; the lear@@ ner . &quot;
the most exploited are the local along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have taken it . &quot;
&quot; it was missing the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil . &quot;
we need to be glad about every euro turnover .
&quot; the sales revenue grew to &quot; &quot; more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the tr@@ ens@@ ation have thrown its operation &quot; around two years . &quot;
half of his employees have to dism@@ issed .
if I would have been a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dism@@ issed if politics would have re@@ acted .
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt laid on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there would be a financial compensation , with the reference , the hospitality benef@@ ited otherwise from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 Now they also bear the dis@@ advantages that result from the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
g@@ öh@@ ner white from other land@@ circles where something they have managed .
&quot; at all charges , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his host @-@ site will continue . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family @-@ owned company has been located since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars now pre@@ tends to be less common because of the complex traffic @-@ performance , it can understand . &quot;
if one can not go down it is also very different .
&quot; that his tri@@ bunal shall return to the end of the refurb@@ ishment , after the end of the refurb@@ ishment , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with B@@ SE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 building work on his clients for the greatest crisis , which has experienced its host @-@ place in their long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months construction work , which is already brutal . &quot;
constantly being rob@@ bed in the name of the terrorist attack against laws .
after the recent attacks in the Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now a tome about safety package .
but what does a D@@ ul@@ atory status have to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ alist say to all that ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Recon@@ c@@ iler .
&quot; all his proposals are politically unden@@ i@@ able , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the idea of his new security statement . &quot;
you do not demand anyone .
&quot; others , further points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
also in this part I participate .
&quot; but as a interior minister , he was located at the results and at a &quot; &quot; able consensus &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after recent attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach , after recent attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach visited a little time before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
but this is all the more extensive .
&quot; a lot has already been announced , announced that a new security authority to worry @-@ encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , it is not the fact that Germany must implement several EU guidelines for air passengers and weapons . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for the safety authorities is not surprising .
&quot; partly , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had a second run for proposals made with the SPD so far not to make : he wants sympath@@ etic for terrorist groups under punishment and jiha@@ dists with dou@@ bl@@ aded citizen of the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; however , it is nevertheless necessary for reasonable and challenging even nothing , which did not have any chances during co@@ ali@@ tion@@ alist . &quot;
a few new ideas presented de Ma@@ izi@@ ère as well .
they are in part in part : he plans a rapid process for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ention of people before deport@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; refugees who will be targeted in the country to leave their smartphones , and reveal social @-@ media accounts for the safety of security . &quot;
&quot; for ex@@ pi@@ ations for distr@@ acted asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse than so far - such as such , crimes commit crimes or their papers , to wear their identity . &quot;
some of them is political and legal .
some also acts un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
&quot; and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of ge@@ dul@@ ants for instance , the question arises : what does this actually have to do with safety and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the attacks from Ans@@ bach and Wür@@ zburg refugees were .
&quot; furthermore , many people face the high refugee deal concerns the security . &quot;
&quot; and things that are deeply concerned about the people , let themselves not cl@@ ing even in election times . &quot;
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
&quot; arrival in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach .
the in@@ security is great .
&quot; and yes , there are campaigns . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the union and the SPD are thus increasing in the subject of inner security . &quot;
in the last days there were up between the two parties .
&quot; only a gar@@ ris@@ ger argument about the facilities of the police police , then on a safety policy @-@ related ideas of some Uni@@ ons Interior , in which the R@@ ess@@ ort@@ gers also call a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the double citizenship . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also a question of irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able notes .
from a return of the double pass he got nothing .
we have had the discussion in Germany .
&quot; if you are new , it is not meaningful . &quot;
and in a bur@@ ka pro@@ hibition he made constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether its own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ists , it must first show itself . &quot;
there is some things which could make dispute .
&quot; however , the SPD is also trying to pro@@ vision@@ ing ourselves in the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; party Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized only into careful talk and say , &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to improving safety . &quot;
&quot; still , Volkswagen glimp@@ ses . &quot;
despite diesel sk@@ and@@ als get off the payout worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs round .
in the back @-@ back action there is a word .
Volkswagen starts in the issu@@ er ship@@ ments in the second half @-@ half .
&quot; in the current year of Europe , in the previous year , despite the diesel ar@@ ming thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ run markets continue to prove a plus . &quot;
&quot; however , in July the core @-@ brand VW primarily weak@@ ened in Western Europe and thus res@@ ili@@ zed the overall sale , as is noted in the D@@ ax Companies . &quot;
&quot; worldwide , the VW Golf in July sold with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year . &quot;
in the home market Germany s@@ ack@@ ten the shipment to almost a Six@@ th .
T@@ ack@@ er@@ ef Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann took the weaker numbers from July above all on two selling days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , it has been added to a department store in some core markets . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt of compliance in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um has continued to be deb@@ ited from the EU , explain a speaker . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the gas weap@@ onry are initially escal@@ ated , there is also another minus to be@@ ech . &quot;
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the mainly affected Hau@@ ke of the Nieder@@ sachsen case is continuing to reflect on the Dies@@ el@@ sc@@ andal . after the first seven months , there is only a payout percentage of 0.7 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles . &quot;
consolidated author Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance a sales split from January to July .
&quot; 1,3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time , around 5,@@ 904 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software check @-@ in .
&quot; alone in Germany , VW around 2.5 million vehicles calls for refurb@@ ishment to repair shops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of re@@ conversion , VW , that the re@@ building of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after conversion of vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance . &quot;
&quot; the bus point out the customer after the retro@@ fit into a &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; as it was on Friday in the company . &quot;
cause have legal enemies .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reports , Volkswagen ge@@ aring its German customers now but a guarantee for back diesel models . &quot;
these have been confirmed on the previous Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the traffic of Defence was confirmed that this meeting was meeting .
VW has the requirements of my investig@@ ative Commission and the KBA in full .
&quot; devi@@ ations of this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; stated by Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance after the retro@@ fitting no deterior@@ ations , and all type @-@ related vehicle levels will have unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not as it was called in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; in the wide term &quot; War@@ ran@@ ty &quot; , Volkswagen provides the possibility that customers come for example a half year after the conversion into a workshop - and this could result in the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do . &quot;
&quot; also in customer interest , it is important to avoid any other damage caused by any other damage which has nothing to do with respect to any warranty conditions , as it was meant . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ database G@@ mund at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich austerity demands - as a second Institute in Germany .
&quot; captain Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers , which can park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case , and does not fores@@ ee a signal : normal austerity &quot; would not be afraid to pay for their austerity pen@@ al pen@@ al code . &quot;
&quot; bearing banks money on night during the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay for a 0.3 percent pen@@ al code . &quot;
this charge requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ database G@@ mund from September of private and company customers for deposits over 100,000 Euro on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euro are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 cost will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; it has been 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the other , which he could not be dec@@ eived . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me at the bank account and cause a 0.3 percent cost , &quot; said the chef . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lie down for every million 4000 Euro . &quot;
the costs shall be taken on after the dec@@ ay principle .
&quot; the cash is easy to let in the Tres@@ ores of the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ tical database would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; I have already experienced four over@@ inci@@ dents , I might not even have the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot;
most customers had understanding and inter@@ change on other plant forms .
few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria said : &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is significant costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; they alone wear , be &quot; &quot; economic permanently not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore raised their fees for con@@ duction , credit cards or credit transfers . &quot;
with pen@@ zin@@ sen for deposits of three million euros the Thur@@ ingi@@ an Volks@@ - and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank Alten@@ burger Country with its sk@@ ating bank branch 2014 head@@ lines made .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief business leaders of the banking association , said : &quot; we do not expect that private customers have to pay for deposits , the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks have much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a client , which is equipped from the property a little lush . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , if they are free money . &quot;
&quot; the 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; the region is living @-@ known actors , ath@@ l@@ ete and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria are currently not known as any further banks which charge a p@@ aging rate for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; the president of the Federal Association of German People &apos;s banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank Ischgl ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had stated in late June : &quot; the threshold , into neg@@ atives , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is hard , and it dro@@ pping the migration of embarrass@@ ed to competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany will not fall in the width .
destination plates : who are buying sound@@ proo@@ fs ?
lon@@ gl@@ ary men love plates .
&quot; before you go to the commentary box , to conf@@ use it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ infection men with rough si@@ bl@@ ings , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the vol@@ ati@@ fying glass of record of sound @-@ insulation does not want to welcome a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that would like to welcome the re@@ birth of physical objects but to mid@@ life no@@ stalgia . &quot;
&quot; those who have recently purchased a record , are all predic@@ tions according to the age between 45 and 54 . &quot;
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely che@@ ek @-@ group .
it is also not a hor@@ des by hob@@ by@@ ists - it has an emotional meaning : older turn@@ tables retain their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a mess@@ enger report on TV , I would follow the camera , while in the middle of a busy road in Soh@@ o walk , a hum@@ ble pull @-@ suit and wild@@ ly so@@ othing , before I keep away , keep my hands and keep a certain determin@@ ant as : &quot; &quot; so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let us take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even though the heart of So@@ hos is slowly coming to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic turn@@ tables . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera to the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I by S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle ages ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of number : eight men middle ages , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess already , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; these sil@@ ken , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed by him ) , dress the walls of his room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he possesses such considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy records when they appeared and again buy objects which he sold , when he was young and bank@@ rupt . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy , are out of the late six@@ ties , early 70@@ s , who appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things , where I probably was something too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agre@@ es to those who are buying plates , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time , and adds : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
this is my aster .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works by S@@ ister Ray , believes also that many customers who meets the You@@ g@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who have heard from the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback , and let themselves be able to buy their old records again . &quot;
&quot; from talks that I have led , people usually have been kidn@@ apped in 1998 or in 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who sold their records sold to buy CDs , sell now their CDs to get back to buy their records , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to tr@@ ailers of the record high@@ vals of a particular age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
&quot; it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica , to realize that record stores a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older clients participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record @-@ fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound@@ proo@@ fs , of objects , the happ@@ ier Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the feeding of a void or possession of the pos@@ sessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
this is with me as collectors so I think it is with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; sol@@ dered a staff of a record @-@ stack .
&quot; a survey of IC@@ M in April reve@@ aling that almost 50 % of the people have bought a record , they have not yet heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player , which they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , no record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the report , I would probably look very concerned , while I was pet@@ alled by a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works with Sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle ages ) , has noticed a &quot; Tro@@ ph@@ ä@@ en@@ as@@ pe@@ kt &quot; of Re@@ vi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone came only here and said , &quot; I have no record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead record , so that I can put them into the shelf &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a great percentage , but it is definitely occurring . &quot;
more produ@@ kt@@ las@@ ous , less music @-@ sided . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones who are slowly getting started . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted the sound@@ track to almost a whole floor , has a b@@ n audience than I call . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , Teen@@ ag@@ ej@@ ungs and women aged aged . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the standing @-@ standing shops - wild Be@@ asts syn@@ thesizer , and sex@@ t@@ packed Pop instead of experimental jazz , it is good to see such a diversity among customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them sees son@@ der@@ ous lonely , but nag@@ ging psychological trau@@ mas are difficult to be fixed when one stands next to someone 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around in the shop for a few minutes and looked at the variation of the dot@@ ted plates . &quot;
it more makes a man@@ tal mor@@ tal body than a big one .
&quot; it does not deserve much , so the collecting of records is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to hear music from one computer or other way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; they drives with a de@@ ar@@ est sig@@ h . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
&quot; my last stop is a business , by which is said that a new generation of records have been inspired : urban out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; while I would like to post@@ ure the je@@ ans hot@@ p@@ ants , I observe a group of young teenagers that will be group@@ ed for a moment to buy Polar@@ oid cameras before a father and daughter to think about a cro@@ sl@@ ey record player . &quot;
&quot; the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Bu@@ ckl@@ ey , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody sees it - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , also the one that is most for luxury items such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my rep@@ ent@@ ations take note that the results of You@@ g@@ v vote , they leave at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the great number of female collectors and records , who exist in reality , record stores and in online research . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning and certainly not with the leg through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they ste@@ amed the rigi@@ d view of an un@@ heim@@ ring , 30 @-@ year @-@ old pres@@ enter , who h@@ unted down over the shoulders of the middle ages . &quot;

French court leh@@ an@@ ed offer about A@@ br@@ iss of shops in the Jung@@ le refugee camp
&quot; a French Court rejected an offer of authorities in Cal@@ ais , do@@ zens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , live in the thousands of refugees . &quot;
&quot; during a trial period this week ar@@ gues the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should be fu@@ elled to sell 72 pro@@ vis@@ ing goods , sell hair@@ dressing services or buy tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 c@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that these places should be burnt down , because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no tax would be paid , and that one fire and san@@ ity risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared with the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals are offered by state supported association and other groups , not enough food for the growing numbers in stock . &quot;
it also resulted in that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in Lille , that there would be no legal basis for the instruction of people who operate the 72 provisional business , but dre@@ aming that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; are absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just people live , living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers will offer .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by precip@@ itation , the young Book kids &apos; Café of the camp , the non @-@ profit organization is operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice to asylum seek@@ ers , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to keep the kids &apos; Café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was that closing &quot; &quot; for this children of a catastrophe , of which the recent eight years are old . &quot;
the two auxiliary organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants lod@@ ged on Friday that the number of living in the jungle is increased over 9.@@ 000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in ne@@ di@@ mm@@ ers throughout the summer .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany Ras@@ er must adapt to the next generation of speed heads : in different federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested especially effectively , the Temp@@ os@@ co is particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for instance at random points , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on the motorway construction or to gentle bridges with temporary tempor@@ al , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure there with a stationary flo@@ ater for compliance with the speed limit . &quot;
a lasting mobile assembly can however be too dangerous or consuming .
&quot; the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery is holding five days , the tr@@ ap@@ ing data is encrypted via a mo@@ dem . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , using laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be captured over several tracks at the same time . &quot;
variable speeds and speed b@@ inger after time , lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the high @-@ stor@@ able state , one can move the p@@ endant according to manufacturer with each car with a to@@ w@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; so that he is not simply cl@@ oned , he is in the boat run , so the wheels also disappear in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and inci@@ dental outside . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an built @-@ in alarm system should protect the Bl@@ itzen before Vand@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer for details of Vit@@ ronic is tested in various federal states and now also used . &quot;

great Britain takes place silver in the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ he Rug@@ by came down on Thursday evening at a ab@@ rupt halt on Thursday evening at the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were struck with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ dicated stage here in Rio .
&quot; Fi@@ ji shared a master@@ class in handling , side @-@ stepp@@ ing , post @-@ run , line @-@ run and ro@@ wer power to win gold - their first oly@@ am@@ ation of any colour . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was struck by the not too bad trophy of the silver medal , Great Britain in this day - and they could well be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they sm@@ ote New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the boy@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could fall back in the final . &quot;
but regardless of that Fi@@ ji would have be@@ aten to form a 15 @-@ man team in order form .
&quot; it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a burning tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck , Fi@@ j@@ is boss Ben Ryan , the former Chef for England from Wimbledon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind it .
eight years ago she lost the Ryan of Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
&quot; here , they lost only one . &quot;
&quot; this fl@@ ap is w@@ alled , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began mar@@ vel@@ ous and caused the attacks of GB@@ s from fun screening .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell to and Co. , as if you were running in driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with even four minutes of play , Jerry Tu@@ wai added another attack from the right corner , which he walked . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB has barely captured the ball .
&quot; a h@@ rag@@ ged T@@ ackle of Mitchell stops the mountain by Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa , a third gate to achieve , but it has just stopped . &quot;
in the seventh minute l@@ ete J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the recovery process and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
v@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ged by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ ened up to the line to make a gate .
the transformation brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it is so , as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still missing . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB led basic changes to the semi @-@ time period and closed the fi@@ ji@@ rian gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the relations of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch @-@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game has been going for a long time in favour of the Süd@@ se@@ ein@@ sul@@ aner , his fans s@@ angen and danced on the ble@@ ach@@ ers . &quot;
it was not hard to admire the playful approach fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i @-@ bag with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the wh@@ ist@@ ling tor@@ ert@@ ed , the Fi@@ j@@ is um@@ arm@@ oured and GB c@@ ick@@ ed be@@ aten in the lawn . &quot;
previously on the day Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated Japan in the semi @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front but Dan Nor@@ ton crossed the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the post in the second half .
&quot; a brilliant tac@@ tic tac@@ tic of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the prize - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ aler@@ es gold than those games and that wants to hot .
&quot; from the first rowing of the morning to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , who go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in its golden moment on Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if there were only those who were sitting on the Ru@@ der , there were three votes in the boat . the echo of the train@@ ee Robin Williams , was all present as they were the second oly@@ mp@@ old in the two without tax @-@ woman in a row , the first women in the history of the British Sports , who put on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , nevertheless their 39.@@ o is un@@ failing use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant ath@@ let@@ inside , which reflects on the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which is not reflected in the type of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in the herd , a Bat@@ a@@ illon aims to contribute to the incre@@ mental progress that make the difference and it was no one but the coach , who would not survive the difference before 30 months , if he was diagnosed this day at all times when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
as he said he is ris@@ ky .
&quot; I had bladder cancer , the op@@ eri@@ able and that did it . &quot;
if you do not do that he spreads everywhere .
it would have been a fairly horrible situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck that he was in early 2014 , off the season , starting from the break to a minimum if such circumstances is at all the correct term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go back soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough . &quot;
this is how it starts .
&quot; the ru@@ gs in itself is already a challenge , but it makes it a bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the in@@ dem@@ ni@@ ce@@ ability of the victory , their first thought of Williams were trying to talk a ner@@ ven@@ ings in the morning to talk a little more than usual , and thus tried to process its own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning , which was the captain at the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ iment in an application in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s maybe something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it is repeated only how much me this means , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked . &quot;
it was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would have no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach of the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have a better person for train@@ able or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with them .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark had to close up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve . &quot;
we were very at the moment imprison@@ ed .
&quot; Helen called &apos; stay in the process , stay in the trial . &quot;
&quot; it is really important , not to be carried out . &quot;
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking out to make a little bit .
&quot; today we wanted no fire@@ works , we just wanted to get a good result and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a time for one year before taking decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , its own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just want to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
this would have been a great deal of pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to grasp that I am an Olympi@@ asi@@ dent . &quot;
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; it feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years pres@@ sive for clarity
&quot; the Managing Director of the &quot; &quot; V@@ eit@@ en@@ stone group &quot; , &quot; R@@ up@@ pert Gö@@ ller , goes to retirement . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; bay@@ ern@@ ational &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a small fr@@ ing@@ ish drinking water @-@ purpose as a model for the large water producers .
in some time there was some time in the origin@@ al@@ on in a part of the Bav@@ arian Rund@@ funk .
little later the water@@ forum of the government of sub@@ fran@@ ken brought the Zw@@ eck@@ verband .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ en@@ stone group &quot; bay@@ ern@@ far as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this is Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller , which was 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband employee , 28 years as managing director . &quot;
at the age of 65 he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose of the V@@ eit@@ en@@ stone group , based in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , promotes each year approximately 150@@ 000 cu@@ bic meters of water and provides 32 locations and past@@ es with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member states are the communities of Kirch@@ l@@ ter , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Baun@@ ach . &quot;
for further cities and municipalities there are water supply contracts .
&quot; the current president , Wi@@ brun@@ ns mayor &quot; in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller was employed in 1985 to be the president of the Zw@@ eck@@ Federation . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very varied and extended to work from the water management and maintenance operations , the budget creation , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations to weekends , &quot; said the Chair . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events they called the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property sales in the field of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the re @-@ creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the divi@@ ding of water pipes . &quot;
there has been no breast@@ feeding and you have always added new features because water life be@@ de@@ ed and drinking water is the most important food .
&quot; in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o , she hon@@ ed Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has worked with a lot of heart@@ nut for his water @-@ purpose , and he has controlled the water @-@ purpose band@@ ed as if it were his own business . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , he considered a real practi@@ tioner to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ en@@ stone group at the nit@@ rate level in front of the water@@ forum of the district of sub@@ fran@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; therefore , he received a lot of recognition and praise . &quot;
Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller in his part praised Water@@ fall Alf@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him 28 years with him .
he is the best water @-@ friendly and he was a faithful bu@@ ck .
together we were a unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from his point of view he describes the Brun@@ n@@ enbau and the restructuring of the Pur@@ pose .
but the greatest challenge and the har@@ dest use were the pi@@ ping at the flood in Kirch@@ l@@ ter on a 3rd January .
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn at once can only be sustained once you filled the flood of P@@ ett@@ stadt .
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel storms from Lau@@ ter who enters the succession of Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man has been on Friday against 10.@@ 45 in an apartment house in Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ ere ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and they are fatal .
&quot; the man himself inv@@ oked himself with us and stated his li@@ fel@@ ine , &quot; said a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators is on the run , after him being publicly challenged . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , nation@@ wide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 m tall , mus@@ cular , brown , and has a gl@@ am@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the police have published a photo of him . &quot;
it is a few years old .
in the meantime the man bears a Gl@@ at@@ ze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still bear the gun at himself , so the police . &quot;
&quot; who Sven S. looks , should call the 110 . &quot;
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rators in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; the competent police in Lübeck , first of all , did not want to make any information on the ather@@ hood or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; but they confirmed that a human being had been killed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing . &quot;

steel - spot@@ light for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in milli@@ on@@ depth .
&quot; financial bur@@ dens resulting in the industry from the oil em@@ rom promotion , are from the table . &quot;
&quot; it take place in the liberation of renewable energies in the so @-@ called individual energy production in the German steel industry , &quot; &quot; Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Fri@@ days ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am really pleased that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot;
&quot; according to the European Commission , the European Commission was planned first to ask the steel producer , the gases from the tes@@ ho@@ fen to generate electricity generation for their own consumption , to ask for the Cash @-@ Register . &quot;
the steel industry also dro@@ pping additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , I now give a basic certificate with the European Commission to talks with competition com@@ miss@@ arin Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators used in the steel plants will be replaced , the case of an E@@ EG @-@ turnover of 20 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , this will not be raised in the steel industry . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission to own electricity generation . &quot;
&quot; thus , the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely written . &quot;
special meaning have the successful endeav@@ ours of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; steel is the future &quot; &quot; is a first step . &quot;
&quot; further must follow . &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of the E@@ ight For@@ e@@ dic@@ s are air conditioning and employment targets , &quot; explained IG Metall boss Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from Over@@ kap@@ az@@ ties and a considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
&quot; last year , the situation continues to intensi@@ fy as the world &apos;s largest dro@@ wns in China given the weak@@ ening of local demand for the world market . &quot;
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel @-@ crus@@ hing prize @-@ dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring the situation has a little relaxed .
&quot; to one point , import duties on impor@@ ter effect , on the other hand the economic views of China were opened . &quot;
unclear is how sustainable the price recovered .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp stayed with caution on Thursday .
&quot; finally , the prices would have been more stag@@ nat@@ ured . &quot;
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to close the closing of individual works at least .
&quot; at the end of 2015 , around 86@@ ,000 people were employed in the German steel industry . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel manufacturers stay cau@@ tious despite increasing prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; they produced more than 3.4 million tonnes of more than six percent lower than in the previous year , like the economic association of steel by Friday . &quot;
after a short increase in May the amount of the second month went back in a row .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the production has increased by two percent below the previous year . &quot;
the association expects an improved customer level in the coming months due to an improved customer level .

&quot; they often solve social and family structures at an age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize themselves on the others , and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says Hac@@ kler . &quot;
for the elderly are practicing a deep and controlled breathing .
&quot; who demands his lungs regularly , but also in everyday life not so fast from the p@@ est . &quot;
&quot; even though it is about obtaining the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on elderly people S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz says from the Federal Labour Association of seniors @-@ organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher place , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often observe that the singing or hearing of songs with older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often linked to positive feelings of her youth . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melo@@ dies , self @-@ denied people on long past events . &quot;
in singing the head will also be a special performance explained L@@ enz .
while at the same time concentrate on their own voice and on a pre @-@ given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge .
&quot; elderly people who live alone , practicing this way not only to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through the singing in the choir .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ esteem is growing by the singing in the choir .
&quot; to show themselves : if I am long for something , I will better and alert about me - this experience rein@@ forces . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to begin with the singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he says , little talent has to have . &quot;
&quot; one does not sing alone - with 50 sin@@ ful men who h@@ ears it , when a sound is about it ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the suitable offer , seniors have different options , says Hac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; sings someone from the acquain@@ t@@ ances in a senior choir , you can easily connect . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views over the cho@@ irs in the area .
&quot; those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church , or the church . &quot;
many seniors @-@ cho@@ irs can also be found via the Internet .
&quot; who has no access to the internet , the family , friends or neighbors can ask for help with the internet . &quot;
&quot; who desire has to sing , should definitely connect to a choir , ob@@ serving Hac@@ kler . &quot;
singing the soul well and has something Be@@ fre@@ eing - this applies to any age .
cats respond sensitive as a cat on fri@@ ght of the young .
Bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover which affect the effect of Katz@@ enb@@ lo@@ ys on adult animals .
&quot; to their surprise , the males also let the males not cold - however they kept in the difference to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arousal level of cats at the Mi@@ h of the Small .
they react to ten percent faster to Lau@@ te of kitt@@ ens who find themselves in great need as scientists from the veterinary University and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
&quot; K@@ ater also react on the rod of kitt@@ ens , but always the same . &quot;
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the h@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young for the males are either not re@@ movable or not of meaning , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; it is first authorized by the study that was published on this Friday in the &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already figured out that the duration and pitch of the kitt@@ ens is different with the ur@@ gency of their help . &quot;
observed a total of nine @-@ grown hang@@ over and eight con@@ ges@@ tures from the animal preservation of the MH@@ H .
you were played for a ru@@ p of little children who were taken out of the litter for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more arous@@ ed kitt@@ ens , which were additionally lifted up . &quot;
the researchers consider their results in spite of the small sample of the sample for failure .
&quot; all females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the fri@@ ght , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned faster to l@@ oud@@ speaker when this call@@ ings of the very sublime kitt@@ ens played .
this ability may possibly be alleged or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males responded at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already investigated several times in humans the reactions of women and men on cri@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; also in doing so , some studies showed that women were sensitive to inf@@ ants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , the Bi@@ olog@@ im Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski takes up with &quot; g@@ ala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
Turkey has been en@@ acted against the one @-@ faced soccer set of Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r .
he will be accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time , after the coup trial , Turkey is again an important football match . &quot;
in front of the du@@ el of the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese between B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ in Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally : &quot; Business as . &quot; is announced .
&quot; even in the suspension of the relief after the crash , the government , the daily lives of norm@@ ali@@ zer should not be affected . &quot;
&quot; but this does not apply to those who are suspected the movement of pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
football is not made even before the football .
against the earlier Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r the prosec@@ utor filed an arrest warran@@ t .
&quot; accordingly , he was accused of being accused of a terrorist group in America by now in America . &quot;
Sü@@ k@@ r is said to be the followers of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is bl@@ amed of President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan for the coup d .
&quot; although it was true for 90 days of the exceptional condition until October , actually it has been on the life of most Turks but as good as no impact . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; on public places across the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for an end . &quot;
the sport is - as the whole country - split in p@@ endant and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
&quot; but what the Gro@@ s of the Turks , but given the dramatic experience in history , is the strict rejection of military coup . &quot;
even the fans agreed - whether their heart beats me for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as .
&quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; it is especially going to come back to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
his sporting value placed the Köl@@ ner in the refined season under proof : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions ended the 31 @-@ year @-@ old his first play @-@ time as Top@@ scor@@ er of his association .
in the end@@ game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he generated the 1 : 0 @-@ winning bu@@ ffer .
the newspaper &quot; F@@ AN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; thank him : &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and secured the trophy .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; , &quot; the dis@@ continued season for the record was a irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot;
after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League the &quot; lions &quot; were distinguished also in the Europa League early .
in the south per li@@ g there was only rank six .
the season was not good .
the trophy was the only way to gain something .
&quot; this is done and that is the most important &quot; , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master B@@ esi@@ on@@ as ran better the game year better .
&quot; above all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who runs through 26 Seas@@ on@@ ers as Sü@@ ver @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cher on the basis of the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year @-@ year .
&quot; at the AC Florence , it had only been issued at the AC Florence under contract and to return to B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as , only borro@@ wed Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt to return , because of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario nevertheless wants to come to us he must only say it , &quot; &quot; the journal &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; Club@@ house Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; this would have to be ready to give up some one third of its 7.5 million euros valued at 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man realized : &quot; his salary in Florence can we not pay . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have medals for Olympics in Rio
the 34 year old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was locked twice due to D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa must not start in Rio .
others over@@ led athle@@ tics sc@@ ers can only lau@@ gh - they are fighting in Rio to medals .
&quot; the theme of dop@@ ing still determines the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian @-@ g@@ rie@@ de Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa had opened their starting point shortly before the games , was mer@@ ged in her start ( 100 meters of chest ) mer@@ c@@ eas@@ eless and un@@ f@@ ted . &quot;
there was a sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le scen@@ eries : with a sp@@ lic@@ ed smile she was still proud in the hall and prov@@ oked it with her appearance .
&quot; as a fixed that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke into a jar crash . &quot;
&quot; yet there are numerous other sports@@ men , who will go to the start despite dop@@ ing past in Rio Olympics . &quot;
here an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Scale / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in the athle@@ tics . &quot;
he had been locked for two times because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since his spell the Olympi@@ asi@@ eger of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , it is more than 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered to be the largest editor of usability . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Scale / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ s and si@@ eben@@ fold World Championship in 2010 had to sit a six@@ sm@@ on@@ ati@@ le lock after you have been proven to take pain k@@ iller by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; they had had a strong to@@ oth@@ ar after surgery , the 29 year @-@ old defended themselves . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 the Olympi@@ ast@@ eg@@ s of 2012 , World Championships was positive in 2013 and Europe Championships from 2010 to 2016 positive on the ban stimul@@ ant stimul@@ ated meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine tested . &quot;
Per@@ kovic captiv@@ ates the wis@@ ely intake and was locked six months .
the four wid@@ est lit@@ ters this year are to the account of the great Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Scale / USA ) : the Beijing @-@ Olympi@@ asi@@ eger and two @-@ mal@@ icious champion of 400 m , was positively tested and 21 months had been locked . &quot;
a means for penis enlargement may have been responsible for wor@@ med mer@@ ged .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the so fastest man in the world .
&quot; I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably hardly a ath@@ l@@ ete , so many medals were subsequently detected . &quot;
&quot; so , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after having been established about testosterone dop@@ ing . &quot;
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had also had to leave Olympia @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid D@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone ab@@ norm@@ ality .
&quot; this also disc@@ ern@@ ed Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille of the Olympic Games in 2008 , he got back on account of a judgment of the International sport Tribunal . &quot;
with 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m it lies on the rank of two of the world &apos;s list .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world ch@@ anc@@ ellor and gold fav@@ oured was only tested in May , but must still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; during the 29 year old world World Championship , references to the intake of a ban device was found , the lock of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency W@@ ada dropped off and ran already on 13 July . &quot;
Bom@@ ben@@ terrorism in Thailand - Austri@@ ans in@@ ju@@ red - Extra T@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand at the woman in contact with the woman , told the speaker of the State Department , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday . &quot;
&quot; they have suffered cutting @-@ wo@@ unds , and be treated in the hospital , but have already been abandoned . &quot;
it was planned for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the vacations Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on are also affected Austrian citizens , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the State Department stand in touch with the local authorities , so sn@@ ake . &quot;
at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok Hua H@@ in had first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a foreig@@ ner of two bom@@ bs .
&quot; according to police , a Tha@@ il@@ änder@@ in were killed and about 20 people were wounded , among them the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch , and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday again , two Spr@@ eng@@ ages went up once again , but according to the authorities a further person was killed . &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket was reported in the morning a bom@@ b@@ ulation .
during det@@ on@@ ation near the popular Bad@@ estr@@ ands Pat@@ ong was in@@ ju@@ red by police information a taxi driver .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bom@@ b , which cont@@ ends a city of Kalamata . &quot;
the spr@@ ink@@ age is according to the authorities in a flo@@ wer@@ et before the Re@@ four of the coastal Police in the air .
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations demanded , in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast , as well as in Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on on the southeast coast several wounded . &quot;
&quot; I go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , called it . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ b attack carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said Arm@@ eg@@ ener@@ al Dan@@ ai crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ day@@ morning before journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
it is too early to express themselves on possible moti@@ fs - probably it is about the works of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern that is typical for the bom@@ b attack on the bom@@ bing separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police on the other hand said the attacks in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age that is limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot;
rather it is clear that the bom@@ bs were placed by enemies of the ruling military j@@ unt@@ a .
&quot; in the past few days , the authorities would have received secrets of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
still unclear which group behind the attacks .
&quot; the police pointed their officials in the whole country to increase security around important government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement areas . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ bing attacks , but they mostly do not oppose tourists . &quot;
&quot; Hua H@@ in is a palace that has been used over the years of Thailand , King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Adu@@ ly@@ ade@@ j . &quot;
&quot; after the dec@@ aying bom@@ b @-@ explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry is recommen@@ ding the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on his homepage , the instructions of the Thai safety authorities . &quot;
&quot; high safety risks ( security level 3 ) led to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; according to disputes between security and Muslim populations , there is no necessary travel to these provinces . &quot;
increased safety risks ( security level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were taken a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the military j@@ unt@@ a .
the military influence of the military influence also in the years to come .
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said , the bom@@ bs have been an attempt to sti@@ cking chaos while moving towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism moved . &quot;
&quot; the Military unt@@ a , which had taken power after a phase of bloody sho@@ ots , holding himself good , the kingdom has again lead to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not able to have succeeded in getting a handle in the extreme south of the country in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
just a year ago in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hin@@ du Sch@@ purely 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody bom@@ b of the recent history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is into the spot@@ light of the Federal State for constitutional protection .
&quot; according to several nation@@ als , the Constitutional Court also have put the Group under observation in the covenant . &quot;
&quot; we see at the &apos; identity movement &apos; cl@@ ue for aspirations against the non @-@ liberal basic rule , &quot; said Constitutional Court Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , Zu@@ w@@ other Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ use in extrem@@ ist way . &quot;
that is why we observe the movement now .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that has been active since 2012 in Germany . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; multic@@ ultur@@ al @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; un@@ controll@@ able mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional advis@@ er in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; &quot; identity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said to be closely aligned with the state &apos;s decision in the decision of decision .
&quot; groups like the &apos; identity movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; in general , we are trying to touch extre@@ mi@@ sts to address them with juven@@ iles . &quot;
&quot; Islam@@ ists , as well as legal extre@@ mi@@ ties . &quot;
this is not a praying advertising for the own thing .
the propaganda is to speak the people emotional .
young people are there in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; most recently , it had given reports of contacts with the &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; of Af@@ D @-@ politicians . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said I have no knowledge .
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind can only be relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals , which are extrem@@ ist , changing their destination and so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
critical is thus whether such people have control over the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view of the significant increase in right@@ ed crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees , Ma@@ ate , he would not yet speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but we have found it in recent years that there can be right @-@ resistance structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the free group .
&quot; it can be well that further legal group@@ ings or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ extrem@@ ist moti@@ fs . &quot;
a nation@@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of leg@@ alism is not recognizable .
the previous groups have emerged on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; worried , Ma@@ ate that many over@@ gri@@ ps went to the account of people who were not entered into the right scene before . &quot;
this is the worrying .
many of the Tat@@ di@@ ct attack on asylum seek@@ ers were not known as crimin@@ als to politically motivated criminal off@@ ender or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; many people have committed crimes committed before with legal extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or Left , who then have radi@@ cal@@ ised by far @-@ wing extremis@@ m . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te will become the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
you will not always determine the Olympi@@ oni@@ ken or world @-@ head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous appearance of RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer play in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight swimm@@ ers from Ethiopia is so slowly that he could no longer see in the TV pictures . &quot;
he disappeared just - no matter how far the cut was selected .
&quot; in the social networks , Hab@@ te became then as viral inter@@ ne@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old con@@ cludes with a back of 48 seconds , and won the 5@@ 9th prize of 59 Star@@ tern . &quot;
&quot; however , it was rather not a spor@@ ty figure that attracted the attention of international media . &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old nevertheless takes part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special start@@ up from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub @-@ presented countries known .
&quot; as in the e@@ dic@@ s most athletes , I wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te makes ready for the big race .
quickly the first con@@ names took the lap .
some media represented him as &quot; RO@@ BEL of W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; with &quot; &quot; Well @-@ cast &quot; &quot; the English Bou@@ lev@@ ard@@ sheet &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; made him fun with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; his time , he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres of Fre@@ isti@@ l , as it didn &apos;t play a role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; was also drawn .
&quot; during the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was given attention to medi@@ al attention . &quot;
unforgettable was the performance of the swimming pool from the Equ@@ atorial Guinea @-@ Guinea when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 meters of Fre@@ isti@@ l .
fr@@ ene@@ tic was accused M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i at that time .
&quot; the back then 22 @-@ year @-@ old did not swim for eight months before Olympics , and had never taken such a long distance before the competition . &quot;

&quot; he is officially said to accept the function of a &quot; &quot; contractor &quot; , &quot; until the successor to Hart@@ mann was found . &quot;
&quot; as a reason for the res@@ ign@@ ations , the company called &quot; different views &quot; to long @-@ term business orientation . &quot;
details wanted a company on Friday not to call .
&quot; who will be getting the market research company on the future , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; in An@@ leg@@ ality circles , it was on Friday , during the shareholders , last for the disappointment of the continued success of the years ago have been raised restructuring large . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K tip since 2011 .
&quot; the fruits of the restructuring is still not visible after 5 years , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; given the last poor Gf@@ K business , each Ombud@@ sman will eventually become rest@@ less . &quot;
&quot; if that would be the case at BMW , it would also be the qu@@ and@@ ts . &quot;
the company had failed to stop its loss in the pre @-@ quarters in the second quarter of 2016 .
&quot; with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales rose by 6.5 per cent below the level of the compar@@ ative pre @-@ year figure . &quot;
&quot; compared to the first half of the year , sales were decreased by € 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million by 3.4 per cent . &quot;
&quot; in the second quarter , the profit in the second quarter most of all , has been deb@@ ited from the company in view of its difficult economic situation . &quot;
&quot; in Consumer Experience , the company &apos;s Consumer Experience takes a loss of 139 million Euros to the Group under the equivalent of a loss of 14@@ 8.@@ 2 million . &quot;
in the second quarter of 2015 the Gf@@ K had still managed a consolidated profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus non@@ slip in Kar@@ pac@@ ed in Gr@@ aben : eight Ver@@ last
&quot; during an accident of a coach , with 43 seniors as passengers are on Thursday in Kar@@ pac@@ ed ( district of Aur@@ um ) eight people have been in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
&quot; two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injury , divided the police with them . &quot;
&quot; the 66 years old driver of the leg of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to their dates , according to the opposite le@@ aster , which was partly driving on the counter . &quot;
&quot; the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , like a speaker of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported . &quot;
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire@@ works liber@@ ated the in@@ mates .
six lif@@ ebo@@ ards and a not@@ ch came to the accident at the Landes@@ straße 2 .
the most recent travelers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kru@@ mm@@ ner district P@@ ew@@ sum .
&quot; there , they should be waiting for a replacement bus of the travel business . &quot;
investig@@ ators demanded the lor@@ ry and possible witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; the fees per cu@@ bic meters is from 1 October 2016 for the area of the se@@ wage system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 . Euro / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( so far : Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( so far 2,@@ 18 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage fee will then increase once again , when appropriate improvement measures will be necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a down@@ side calculation , the se@@ wage rate in Az@@ endorf is then at 4.@@ 37 euros per cu@@ bic meters . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was found during the approval of the budget by the Land@@ rat@@ its Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these se@@ wage systems . &quot;
&quot; due to its legal foundations , the market is oblig@@ ated due to legal foundations the facilities are free to operate . &quot;
&quot; from 1 October 2016 the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Wy@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg have to take deep into the wall@@ et . &quot;
the en@@ rol@@ ment increased between 48 and 67 percent .
as administrative leader Herbert Schmidt from the body showed a ne@@ ocal@@ ulation of fees for the dra@@ inage of the market communities .
during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 may be over@@ - or under@@ covers from the previous cal@@ end@@ ation period .
&quot; the engra@@ ving increase is lit with all three se@@ wage systems by relatively small facilities with a very low water , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; consequently , because of the small distribution foundation for example , it would have a serious impact for the repairs of several thousand Euros . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the water supply in all three plants are slightly declined . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the backward con@@ cul@@ ation period in all three plants , not least due to their age , gentle and repar@@ ations in a considerable extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that in the se@@ wage @-@ system Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage .
&quot; in the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ sch@@ ank , which had to be out@@ dated nearly 20 years old convey@@ ors from the ground up to nearly 20 years of operation of the first fl@@ ashes , the Kl@@ är@@ schl@@ amm , and an additional ventilation to be installed in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; to these exceptional expenses , the advanced super@@ vis@@ ing and maintenance costs came into account accordingly in the new cal@@ end@@ ation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 are still clearly below the current level .
&quot; stone cottages made clear that with low water fall in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , in addition , Schmidt , the market volume of large entertainment costs have stayed in the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the so @-@ called equipment will continue to remain prec@@ arious , since you cannot expand the supply of the wast@@ ew@@ ater @-@ purpose of Fries@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal for these installations , because it is concerned with deficit . &quot;
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national stat@@ s show that Inflation in Bulgaria in July 1 % was on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year were reported as positive 0.3 % .
the annual average de@@ flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1,0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was 0.6 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 amo@@ unted to 0.2 % .

&quot; prices fell in clothes and shoes ( 2.3 % ) ; Mo@@ bili@@ ar , household appliances and routine balances ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; rates stayed as in pre @-@ month at alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
snap@@ chat &quot; Anim@@ ations &quot; - critic@@ ised as an Asian caric@@ ature
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel against breed . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool it allows Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users , to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that &apos;s already absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be made from a Roy Lich@@ ten@@ stein paintings . &quot;
&quot; the filters are imm@@ utable , peculi@@ ar car@@ ving tools that generate more than 30 million improved selection per day . &quot;
all mis@@ steps will come to the public .
&quot; Snap@@ chat filter have drawn cri@@ tically in the past , in which they accused , that the App Black@@ face fo@@ sters or white skin as beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when this week taken a filter a filter , which gave them sl@@ ain , false teeth and commemor@@ ated che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ lowing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they asked whether this repeated contro@@ versy sur@@ rendered to a larger problem that the company with diversity has .
&quot; the news and the rebellion were widely used on Wednesday , with reports of The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat , that it would have been de@@ activated . &quot;
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as hom@@ age to Ani@@ me characters and not as a caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders that have experienced seg@@ is@@ m , rec@@ alled the filter at vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others turned the Ani@@ me comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American painter , whose t@@ we@@ et over the photos were widely used , that the filter &quot; &quot; hur@@ ting and k@@ ill@@ ers were cancelled . &quot;
she added that it was difficult to argue with the counter@@ position of a very disgu@@ ised Asian caric@@ ature and the filter@@ ing effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not secure , but that the yellow @-@ face @-@ face was pulled into the wast@@ ew@@ ing extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company crossing this cultural pride .
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversi@@ fication and integration process , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed in the race as their older counter@@ player - might be more of what to expect to sen@@ sibility .
&quot; if one of the snap@@ shots filter@@ ing a picture created for a user so it is much more difficult , that such things were un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Zh@@ u decided to work as a product man@@ ger and engineering in the medium to clear their snap@@ chat account , to delete others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a phone interview , she said that she believe that rac@@ ed ch@@ ment has a lack of diversity in the settings of snap@@ shot in Snap@@ chat . &quot;
Zh@@ u criti@@ ci@@ zed the big part white who only male leadership team and ended its attachment with a has@@ ht@@ ag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin @-@ colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; the Chinese I @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin @-@ colors that are working there , but not in positions in which they are safe or feeling to say what about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their mind , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat was largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not report numbers on diversity of its staff and points out its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , it was Snap@@ chat starting to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a speaker , the company has recently focused on a recruitment community which focused on under@@ presented population groups and in internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Zh@@ u said that she will be closed her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder whether they need more users like us to say that this is not OK . &quot;
&quot; military Military Intelligence Information , presents Committee of Congress Festival &quot;
&quot; military @-@ members of the United States Central Command modified by the United States Central Command , to draw an optimal picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual status of Congress was allowed on site in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the provisional report , created by an Task Force of Republi@@ can Members of the Joint Task Forces , Secret Services and the Wehr@@ bud@@ get@@ kom@@ mit@@ es , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret Services , which reported how forward their inti@@ mid@@ ations to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State changed . &quot;
&quot; central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; news @-@ related information obtained from high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Com@@ man@@ de@@ uren typically , a posi@@ ti@@ tious picture of American efforts against terrorism would have been permitted and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering when bad analyses of our political leaders presented , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ cans Member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership errors in the Cent@@ Com are up to the top tip of the organization .
the ten @-@ sided report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi Ar@@ med Forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government heads have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how an@@ al@@ ysts looked at the pressure from their previous laws , an optimal picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half @-@ year 2015 many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements made before Congress clearly more positive than it corresponds to the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com An@@ ders announced publicly that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sl@@ oth had already started in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can@@ ical Congress of K@@ ansas , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 until the middle of 2015 , the tops of Central Command , the following reports changed to the risk of ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
the Republi@@ cans rie@@ ve the Task Force in Life after being played with them that an@@ al@@ ysts were concerned with regard to the mani@@ pulation of reports to the Islamic State .
&quot; the report released on Thursday , will be completed by more detail insights , while the investigation will be continued . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are due to the general in@@ spec@@ ter of the Ministry of Defense in progress . &quot;
&quot; democratic members of the Newsletter , published on Thursday its own findings , which coinci@@ de with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com was created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of post @-@ service estimates regarding IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; given the most valuable democr@@ at in the Committee for Adam B. Ship , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Ship , &quot; &quot; consumed the publication of news reports , &quot; &quot; dism@@ issed the morality of an@@ al@@ ysts and &quot; there was a little room for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot;
Mr. Ship and Democrats went to have found no evidence on an intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st as regards a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Beast &quot; .
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by the general in@@ spec@@ ter of the Pentagon , which were included after complaints from Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Defense Minister did not comment on reports of Congress , while the investigation of the general in@@ spec@@ ter would be still in progress . &quot;
&quot; but he also gave that &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence have welcomed a contro@@ versy discussion on these important issues of national defense . &quot;
investig@@ ators have gone through the question of a successful launch campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by an increasing number of relatives by the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year , however , have raised the issue that President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest signs of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State are remin@@ ders of more than ten years ago as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a secretary of many an@@ al@@ ysts on the recommendations of many an@@ al@@ ysts on the recommendations of the invasion of 2003 thoughts . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the u@@ prising against the present reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ ker presents a significant impact on the Government &apos;s opposition to the Government &apos;s Government , since these provisional refin@@ ement would have taken into operation , since these provisional refin@@ ement would have taken into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; this realization was not published , however , the Times reported in September . &quot;
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commands , gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the leg@@ is@@ ations of his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA won fourth match in the Feld@@ ck@@ ey of women , a show@@ down with the UK . &quot;
&quot; a day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 winner over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American tennis @-@ hock@@ ey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americ@@ an@@ ers with 3 @-@ 0 won . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , they could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I am not among the people who kept their doors in mind .
&quot; however , it knows however : the Americ@@ an@@ ers are at 4 @-@ 0 in the oly@@ mp@@ ic competition , and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ inside on the first place that remains un@@ be@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will face up on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which both within its group consisting of six teams in each of the first and second place . &quot;
the first @-@ placed will go a little bit longer out of the way that lead the other group .
&quot; as always the game may go on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprise @-@ story by their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time spent three years with a Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ schl@@ äger in hands ( their two older sisters also played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the leader in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 as she could not qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then the year 2012 came in which for her and her team did everything .
&quot; in the dar@@ ken@@ ing year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , Trainer of the National Team , and thus the things began to turn to better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the working order in London that we now have .
we have ro@@ cked the rod completely .
&quot; on Thursday night , B@@ im opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a withdrawal from the se@@ am . &quot;
&quot; India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed herself surprisingly strong and kept the player from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until they took their hands in their hands . &quot;
&quot; she finished a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left side , then moved into the middle and l@@ up@@ ted the ball into the gate to obtain a 2 @-@ 0 guide . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the ke@@ epers of the United States , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs that previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on Saturday the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ oline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , as late it is , there are the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro will feel safe and in@@ capable , a rapid stag@@ gering between competition and stri@@ fe . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the oly@@ mp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself is a burning st@@ ab , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ watch for swimm@@ ers to the tri@@ ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; you can not switch off the TV to read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbours in the queue in the coff@@ es@@ hop , without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there are Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman warm with gr@@ aces , could possibly be among those known names , built up to the Prime Time , built through sponsors and well @-@ emp@@ athy if he would be a swi@@ mmer , Tur@@ ner or even F@@ real . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights in the oly@@ mp@@ ic tramp@@ oline for gold . &quot;
the oly@@ mp@@ ic flame is not lit up any event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally recognized : air conditioning , Arch@@ ery , Bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the fli@@ ppers and may be there for a long time .
&quot; but if I is likely to make arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the tramp@@ oline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ oline has already been an oly@@ mp@@ ic event since 2000 , it has been so angry when it was in Sydney so many that I asked , did not know that there is an Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art at all . &quot;
this could be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to competition , there has never been a medal in the tramp@@ oline and had made a ath@@ l@@ ete until 2012 it has made up to the final . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Can@@ adi@@ ans who share for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ her Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the tramp@@ oline ski@@ p has a certain out@@ flow char@@ me , partly because it sounds suitable for un@@ enlight@@ ened ear @-@ disp@@ enser for a cl@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than that sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous tre@@ m@@ bling of his never to end up - but also the Grazie of the turn@@ around and do@@ ves that combines two sports that are essentially united .
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
&quot; jumping winner jump on a gigantic tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 foot into the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , H@@ real and ano@@ tos ) before they land on the feet . &quot;
&quot; they are assessed according to the official Olympi@@ apro@@ og@@ ram by execution , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , are competing in Rio . &quot;
the common oly@@ mp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight .
&quot; medalli@@ sts have to go in their quest for gold faster , faster , upward and above , sometimes until the finish , sometimes going back and back , upwards and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; not only chase the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the output wall , but in the television transfer also a further altitude of the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords . &quot;
&quot; the pur@@ pos@@ eful pursuit is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it is enough to sti@@ r even a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I even feel when watching this games as something aw@@ ful .
this tramp@@ oline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ oline @-@ jum@@ per is above .
a backward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ t off , seemingly severe as an astr@@ on@@ aut , goes upwards , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; even here there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no h@@ ectic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games only can be .
&quot; the qualification and end of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in Stre@@ aming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will shine the du@@ ck as part of an afternoon blo@@ c on both days and 14.00 .
&quot; in the middle of the Olympia man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who is likely to over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the awareness increase can only be achieved through the ag@@ gres@@ sions and the obj@@ ectivity of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal recently presented - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his own air rin@@ ist , new fan base . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia have risen to violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that zig @-@ prot@@ ectors were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police with the case .
is Ethiopia just to break up ?
&quot; in the past ten years , it was one of the stable countries of Africa , a solid state of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
but over the last few months the protests against the government has deterior@@ ated in ever more areas .
last week thousands of people on the streets and required fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was al@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful according to human rights organisations .
witnesses gave witnesses that polic@@ emen were shot on zig @-@ armed prot@@ esters and killed .
&quot; in the envel@@ oping videos about protests , which are presum@@ ably hit by the last or beginning of this year , how security people are hit with sticks , while these were forced to make a handle against a wall . &quot;
the Chief of the UN Authority on Human Rights is now asking a detailed investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country and in the future it becomes even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians , to fight against terrorist attacks beyond the region , particularly in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dras@@ tically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; roads are generally quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even though Ethiopia has been anything but an example for democracy - human rights organisations have led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited , with dis@@ si@@ dents effective for silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness . &quot;
but this could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options except protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lectur@@ er in central Ethiop@@ ia . &quot;
all the youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
&quot; there are numerous complaints that cover all from the ground up to the stran@@ gl@@ ehold , with regard to the power of the ruling coalition . &quot;
&quot; after a long @-@ called vote last year , the ruling party and its allies have received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the tension along the border to Eritre@@ a ; a battle for this delicate , controversial line called on June hundreds of lives . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts , like the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ ades , which were more or less forced in recent years , turbul@@ ence the turbul@@ ence and again . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of being driven to the surface now explo@@ ding .
the first seems inno@@ cu@@ ous : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with social media because cheap smartphones were always more frequent and the internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government does not lock access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially at protests , many people can still communicate via internet @-@ Pro@@ x@@ ies that they stop . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians have said that they gathered so at protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for its branches , the Am@@ har@@ as , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from the e@@ dic@@ s mainly Christian high seas , in politics and economy , while they have been the Oro@@ mos , many of which are living and live in flat land areas . &quot;
but even this is changing .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray which represent about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military , in trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former leader leader , was until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ ated disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was seen as tac@@ tic genius , a man who could think about the corners . &quot;
&quot; an@@ al@@ ysts are saying that he was particularly sav@@ vy in it , early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and special appeal to use to process opponents and make them un@@ harmful . &quot;
&quot; the present regime lacks at this basic skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conf@@ ection@@ ary analysis . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian New Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen relatively un@@ ur@@ ly reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; other than Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of North@@ west , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analy@@ tic say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tig@@ ray @-@ controlled safety services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time Ethiopia had been a tur@@ mo@@ il for such a tur@@ mo@@ il , after thousands of elections were prot@@ ested by the government , according to the analy@@ zer and then stolen from the government . &quot;
&quot; while the following swe@@ eps were killed many prot@@ esters , even if it were less than in the last months and these days of un@@ rest was passed relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia guide to their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , as the new p@@ end@@ ent move , as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month &apos;s prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ischen city , of Tig@@ ray guided shops and the hat@@ red of the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in social media . &quot;
analy@@ tic say that the protests supported by the US and other Western allies in a peculi@@ ar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , although they recently w@@ edge that she has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; in the West he clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want its allies in an already vol@@ ati@@ le area breaks . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin Gr@@ at@@ migration . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp declared his claim Obama was established ISIS &apos; sar@@ cas@@ m &apos; .
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to disp@@ er@@ ate the last contro@@ versy sur@@ rendered on Friday that surrounds his campaign , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State , not seriously meant . &quot;
this clear position cast new questions to the communication skills of the republi@@ cans of the Republi@@ can to whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand the American public .
&quot; it also brings his fellow @-@ meeting , who strive to take him during a event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain in the peculi@@ ar position , statements , which he could not be meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the clear@@ ing at a vot@@ al event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp did not return to the statement on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning , Mr. Tru@@ mp said , he was simply sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous day , where Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ man H@@ ugh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to weak@@ en the statement anything , when Mr Obama wants to destroy it , the Republi@@ can presidential presidential election did not want to know anything of it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of the cri@@ tic sp@@ selt on Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he tried to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign due to exp@@ ir@@ repar@@ ations on the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton had speeches on the economic situation in Michigan in this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp tried again to return to this issue . &quot;
&quot; via Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Cl@@ int@@ ons would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought back to his defence of Sar@@ cas@@ m .
&quot; at the end of July he moved strong criticism to him , when he said the Russians were Mrs. Cl@@ int@@ ons e @-@ mails , but he explained later &quot; Of course , I said the s@@ ark@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to move the lingu@@ istic boundaries in politics and then move back to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of its methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans , as they arrive , and then if necessary &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
but I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
&quot; instead of bom@@ bed the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has accepted an unprecedented tone because its survey values have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist who was published on Friday showed a guided tour with great advantage in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ on @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp are generally attemp@@ ting to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often accused his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to understand his hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; but while he is strengthening the focus of attention in the last months of its presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s mit@@ ts have brought his loyal co @-@ meeting to him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may also be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s most prominent , gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview of Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani he said to the accuracy of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true that in this sense that Obama was almost un@@ familiar , small organization , he called them back@@ ers , completely wrong and so it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most of the mainstre@@ am Republi@@ can try to argue that the government served under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as an out@@ ward minister , there ISIS allowed to spread to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressi@@ vely . &quot;
&quot; ahead of the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and cast them before , on each of his words ride down and be taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he desp@@ ised the &quot; poor , j@@ ash@@ mer@@ ing &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; You can not ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats had an excuse for Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s than just a further proof that he was in@@ appropriate for the presidential system .
&quot; once more than the price of the market , Café comes back in Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a s@@ worn café in Williamsburg where you could pay only cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but for 15 years with good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , through the prices of his Bedford Avenue A front was pushed . &quot;
&quot; the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , the verb in summer 2014 continued , sold soap in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous people saw it as the last loss in an gent@@ ish city .
&quot; the artist in Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ella wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a rope @-@ store . &quot;
&quot; but if New York change is , it is also real@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accept credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long@@ time employee of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafes . &quot;
he began to work at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered a customer to provide money for a new outside , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , remedi@@ ed many . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for Bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ som@@ nia model .
it uses even the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he also wanted to experiment .
he carried out new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wich@@ es with bac@@ on and cheese and there are clo@@ cks such as chap@@ els and sau@@ ated oni@@ ons .
there are no natural bow@@ ls .
&quot; the café does not serve beer more , there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months of Rodri@@ guez , Rodri@@ guez , that he noticed a steady stream of old ones . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also pushed for Williamsburg by prices of Williamsburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Williamsburg and visited Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after being moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she gave a while the coff@@ e@@ word on , she said . &quot;
&quot; I became clear that there was the coffee and the culture in verse , which fell to me , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee , even if they ordered this day instead of their usual I@@ ced coff@@ ees a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , which is another new addition . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the trial in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long@@ time and loyal customer since the beginning of the trial in 2003 . &quot;
he went there before work and ordered inev@@ itably the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss arm@@ clock and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Bag@@ el with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; photo Rodri@@ guez said , he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu . &quot;
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes he changes his everyday thing @-@ Bag@@ el with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he did not have a Gro@@ ll about that the soap @-@ business has taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , offered a special soap for embarrass@@ ed coffee from the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go into her offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish residents Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into the Polish and Rodri@@ guez said that he will advance , to make them soon , so that his new neighbors feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has further advantages .
a local S@@ aft@@ sman wants to fill the cold @-@ blo@@ ated coffee in bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café has expan@@ se on a mis@@ art@@ ed building .
for many customers a new verb goes out to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was tri@@ c@@ rop@@ athy and said that he was destroyed in the ground as the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that Bet@@ ting of the Lok@@ als and the bests@@ eller got a new coffee at home as a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to cra@@ ze the smell , &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing eating of the economic crisis in an abundant meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
as gour@@ mets had President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt a Fai@@ ble for refined delicacies on Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland Aqu@@ sch@@ ild@@ ing soup .
&quot; his menu on this day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ff@@ ed eggs in Tom@@ at@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , potato p@@ ree and as dessert a pl@@ au@@ d@@ pu@@ d@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with poor people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; There was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both the Food histori@@ an .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; was told by the Chinese food in the U.S. , while at Zi@@ egel@@ man in her book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; tells you about living in a residential house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in the Har@@ per publisher , illustr@@ ates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a guy in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ ör@@ k@@ ell@@ ent Im@@ bis@@ s in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh@@ water tank with olive oil , while co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato p@@ ree and vegetable food . &quot;
&quot; as the re@@ por@@ ter h@@ ackers ordered , this was the couple for discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ anu@@ ts , liver and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ bro@@ t . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and something Bil@@ lig@@ ently prepared the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ anu@@ ts eat that they serve them as a dinner .
co@@ e gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have put itself in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression there was the table in an American household , especially in rural areas , a All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women cook for male field workers and it was served fresh Past@@ els for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent to hungry during the first World War . &quot; A Square ia &quot; paints the ways of which the land went with it , no longer the s@@ ar@@ ouses . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , tense theme , &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; just as tense was the new bud@@ get@@ di@@ ets : mysterious food such as lo@@ aves and cas@@ ser@@ ene became a stap@@ le food , the cas@@ ser@@ tation to be reco@@ vering , because coo@@ ks have been able to hide un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients under a mu@@ ddy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry cloth .
&quot; meat , which had been the centre of the American kitchen for years , has become a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculi@@ ar mix@@ tures were tried out , as a cal@@ orie @-@ cal@@ orie and nour@@ ishing satisfaction has preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy kitchen . &quot;
&quot; while her research for the book , which includes recipes , they prepared a dish from that epoch , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ anu@@ t butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular supplement on lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man continues to look : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ anu@@ t butter and baked oni@@ ons are not fit to each other .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
&quot; as never before or since then , exagger@@ ated household frames - including Louise Stan@@ ley , leader of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 up to 1943 . &quot;
&quot; by reading recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become annual ministers and the challenge , Pamp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ r@@ ots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square ia &quot; is a celebration of historic ti@@ d@@ bits .
&quot; in particular , tasty are reports of the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ cake @-@ food @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple Io@@ wa farm house in his kitchen , he spoke as the milli@@ on@@ age @-@ heav@@ iness man of the world to which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost g@@ ild@@ ed menu and carried a smo@@ king .
he was glorious .
&quot; President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ anor had asked him to act with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book the an@@ present was described by a household with no interest in flav@@ ours by Ms Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , that the White House brought the bor@@ ed food in Washington but also one of the most blessed food prepared . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , deal with food was rejected , once the land came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science applied to food . &quot;
the pair were better understood when writing the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man in @-@ law was better understood - for example such as food could not throw away .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man reminded himself , &quot; &quot; They made people really sick . &quot;
there was the wind@@ mill .
&quot; after the plate of Eis@@ enberg &apos;s have been vac@@ ated , they moved and Co@@ e a dessert that they had been cooked at home : the pl@@ ough@@ s , the president Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt was lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ el@@ wh@@ ip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man , and added that there was a common trick , with a hum@@ ble name to miss a name . &quot;
&quot; there was no p@@ oured cream , only pl@@ ough@@ s , some flour , sugar , water and c@@ inn@@ amon . &quot;
&quot; each de@@ hydr@@ ated something conf@@ lic@@ ting a spo@@ on in the t@@ aps , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
surprisingly it did not tasted bad .
co@@ e hol@@ s three times a supplement .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; A couple of ch@@ opped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
at bom@@ bs attack : he was the hero of Al@@ epp@@ o
he put his own life in the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar .
he was the hero of Al@@ epp@@ o : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old itself has died in a bom@@ b attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; Om@@ ar was a member of the &quot; White helmet &quot; , &quot; a civil group , which saved according to the picture newspaper until nearly 6@@ 0.000 people saved life . &quot;
&quot; 29@@ 00 Vol@@ unte@@ ers put their own lives on the game , to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to make the first aid in the war area . &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; Om@@ ar was the face of the group : a video of the civil servant , which shows him with a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went to the world . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans to shining symbol@@ ism in the gray of the war .
&quot; but as a hero , he had never seen himself , said according to the picture : &quot; for me , that is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die to save lives , I think that God looks in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Om@@ ar himself fell to an attack on the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ bing attacks in Syria . &quot;
the helic@@ opter have set four fac@@ bom@@ bs above the Alz@@ adia District , one was filled with ch@@ l@@ org@@ as . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we now resolve the poison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bom@@ b , so that no children play with it , c@@ ites the image of his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bom@@ b of the Assad regime had to take terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest wh@@ et is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie usually come only in winter to surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board of the S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the Nor@@ dat@@ lan@@ tics until today .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie received only 150 years of offspring .
&quot; the Greenland shar@@ k at the bottom of the Nor@@ dat@@ lan@@ ti@@ ks along the ground , in an hour it comes on average just 1.@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it arrives , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates 2,@@ 6 km / h - and at this top speed is half as fast as a Rob@@ be . &quot;
&quot; however , this of long @-@ term li@@ festyles seems to be a patent for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate by a Greenland , the 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ ro@@ lein by the Max Plan@@ ck @-@ Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this span , which means a world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the evolution of evolution has long been st@@ aging . &quot;
only faul@@ ts the evidence .
&quot; Grön@@ land ha@@ ie are hard to watch , eventually they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sk@@ inny co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees cen@@ tig@@ rade , they usually dive on the surface only in winter . &quot;
&quot; about the lifestyle of the Grön@@ land ha@@ ie , researchers know little accordingly . &quot;
her time @-@ up emp@@ i@@ ou@@ ted her when she had six animals sitting in front of one transm@@ itter equipment .
&quot; loo@@ t make this shar@@ ks anyway : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a ru@@ b , another had the j@@ aw of a young polar bears . &quot;
possibly they chase sleeping @-@ sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the iron and search ca@@ aver made up of higher water layers for down@@ stairs .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Grön@@ land @-@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as an appl@@ ause from the depth of the Nor@@ dat@@ lan@@ ti@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimeters long , while the largest 5@@ 02 centimeters . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , analy@@ sing them with the carbon @-@ 14 method the lens of shar@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eyel@@ id is already born in front of the birth of the shar@@ ks , which contained in it will no longer be re@@ done . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
&quot; therefore , your birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s than nuclear weapons , as nuclear , try bigger amounts of this radio@@ active carbon in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the length of 220 cen@@ timet@@ res the length of the smallest animal contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated his 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
all major Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie had a normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in its lens with normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities that is created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an age of 335 cen@@ timet@@ res long lasting at the age of 335 , during the record shar@@ k with 5@@ 02 centimeters , even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Grön@@ land females only got up until they are longer than four metres , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers of the length were assigned an age . &quot;
&quot; because one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters is probably on the cus@@ p to the sexually mature and his age was determined with 156 years , Grön@@ land with the multip@@ lication is obviously at least one and a hundred centuries . &quot;
even this is likely to be the world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in e@@ isi@@ an waters is no coincidence .
&quot; also the previous record @-@ holder , a 211 year old Grön@@ land , in whose bac@@ on at N@@ acken to put up a 120 year old Har@@ es , was caught in Alaska . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the low temperatures , often the organism of the animals living there live on austerity . &quot;
they thus mature later - and age slow .
&quot; in order to keep warm water in cold water , the animals are also very large . &quot;
&quot; the volume is growing much faster than its surface , through which the animal inv@@ aded heat . &quot;
the heat loss of a grams of mouse is therefore much bigger than with a grams of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal is therefore living more dangerous and should concentrate on as possible as many descendants as possible , &quot; explains the evolution of evolution . &quot;
a very big animal should invest more in a long life in contrast .
ch@@ asm in a double @-@ pack
&quot; with topics around the building , the community at the recent meeting has focused on the most recent session . &quot;
&quot; with relief the panel took the communication of mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the younger @-@ proven housing areas can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the property , par@@ zel@@ nuts and resolutions issues were clari@@ fied and the moti@@ ons could be clari@@ fied in the housing areas &quot; &quot; road cross@@ roads &quot; &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - B@@ umped age 1 ) to prosp@@ ective buyers nothing more in the way . &quot;
the municipalities is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential area Schön@@ au young families and rough seniors equally appealing .
&quot; as it was meant , buildings can sign up immediately in the Town Hall , about the distribution of the plots will be advised in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to also send inquiries to the settlement of other commercial farms , combined with the creation of jobs , decided to re @-@ decided the municipalities which will be newly created in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the area of sub @-@ time the country has already been extended there around two plots towards state @-@ road 2112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; the city on the Main , therefore , in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg have the best opportunities to move from London abandoned jobs and companies . &quot;
&quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt has benef@@ ited most from the Bre@@ xit V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of competence , financial markets and property markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether monetary lines continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport it has so far enough approval in the UK .
we just use great US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; is calculated with 10000 new jobs in the Main - five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) united the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the euro zone , as well as further important authorities as European insurance company EI@@ O@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the organization for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is head@@ quartered , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central database is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxemburg ev@@ apor@@ ates a large fund business , but as well as Dublin for the infrastructure . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach Frankfurt thanks to the great airport .
&quot; furthermore , the city with easily available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Seine are also more than 50 percent higher than the River Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt is a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of corporate consulting Mer@@ cer is the city on position seven , Luxembourg on Square 19 , Dublin , in place 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7. place . &quot;
&quot; if quality of life is a question of preference : &quot; with its already strong position as financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot; insi@@ sts the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; but London will remain in spite of the Bre@@ xit calls for the most important financial center in Europe , my economic researchers . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the power relations : in London worked in compliance with the numbers of Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking sector , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C Pat@@ ent@@ ate with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. engineer decided that Gilead Sciences are eligible for the re@@ imb@@ urs@@ ement of the legal costs that you have emerged from the hep@@ atic C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June , Gilead was fre@@ ed from a claim of $ 200 million for the injury of two patents from Mer@@ ck , which stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medications S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Harv@@ oni of Gilead in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medications S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Harv@@ oni of Gilead , including the opinion and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; in the collection of the law@@ suit on Thursday , the Secretary General of Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to decre@@ e of the costs which have emerged during the defence of the case . &quot;
Mer@@ ck tries to move to Gilead to cure the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver illness .
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 , as Gilead , and Mer@@ ck took up each other def@@ endant and ownership on lab work , which acts of sofas , the active ingredient in the medication of Gilead . &quot;
by the USA supported troops that they have reg@@ ained full control of Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State .
&quot; supported by the USA , the complete control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j returned close to the Turkish border , after the last IS @-@ fighters in the city have left them , said a spokes@@ man of the group on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , after the excerpt of the still remaining group of fighters that have buried within the city , currently the city . &quot;

Cl@@ int@@ ons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and figures 34,@@ 2 % Bundes@@ inspection
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton published its tax return for 2015 on Friday , this y@@ iel@@ ded a income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective Bundes@@ tax rate of 34,@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 the Cl@@ int@@ ons USD 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former president Bill Clinton announced a income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon &amp; Sch@@ uster for their book on their mandate in the Foreign Ministry . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ int@@ ingo candidate for the European Council , Sen@@ ator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton its head@@ ings of the last ten years . &quot;
you paid an effective Bundes@@ tax by 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ins continue to continue standards with regard to financial transparency , &quot; given Cl@@ int@@ ons Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp is hidden behind false signs and rel@@ ent@@ ators in relation to its previous promises to publish its tax allow@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; it is common for U.S. presidential data to publish their control . although they are oblig@@ ated by law , because of this . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New York busin@@ es@@ sman , and his lawyers have as reason for his denial , given a tax examination by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Cl@@ int@@ ons &apos;s election in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , in relation to the publication of the presidential election of Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s special consultant , to CN@@ N , that he would not permit Tru@@ mp to publish something before tax checks are not completed . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s critics , among other things , the Republi@@ can presidential elections of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already argu@@ ed that his ref@@ us@@ al issues with regard to assets , his donations for charitable organisations , his business and various other compounds thro@@ ws , especially with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has already kno@@ cked out on the subject and published on Friday a video on the internet , in the high @-@ level republi@@ cans Tru@@ mp are calling for its tax return . &quot;
on Thursday she spoke on the subject even during a speech of the economy in Michigan .
he refused to do that which has done every other presidential election in recent decades and to release its tax allow@@ ances . &quot; she said to the crowd .
&quot; Poli@@ tico has reported that Tru@@ mp has not paid or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted a series of tax @-@ forests and tax advis@@ ors that might still be the case . &quot;
form@@ ers have become a topic in the election campaign .
&quot; Clinton supports a regulation that is named after billi@@ on@@ aire and Investor War@@ ren buffet , which would ensure that individuals earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % . &quot;
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election evening for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the last week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ alists has his seat at a meeting to start their control . &quot;
Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax check of the IR@@ S and Tru@@ mp have been &quot; fear &quot; in front of the elect@@ ors and not before tax authorities .
Cl@@ int@@ ons campaign launched tax return to the year 2007 .
&quot; the Cl@@ int@@ ons , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective Bundes@@ tax of about 32 % between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective tax rate of about 40.@@ 5 % . &quot;
&quot; the declaration of Cl@@ int@@ ons of 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of their income as wage , unlike most of all Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main financial investment was a cost @-@ effective index Fund , to which the Cl@@ int@@ ons divi@@ den@@ ds and income of USD 10@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;

&quot; ar@@ cher in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x mode to prevent eleph@@ ants from being inhabited , in people inhabited settlements - they throw cond@@ oms on them that are filled with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the honey@@ guide Foundation , which already had an idea for years ago by organising volunteers in villages in the north Tanz@@ ani@@ as , to use a non@@ violent cl@@ ums@@ y method to protect their homes and crop without inj@@ uri@@ ze animals . &quot;
&quot; previously , many spec@@ ers have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is the meeting day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since then we have developed this ...

Jewish director zer@@ ates Berliner Hotel because Israeli di@@ alling code was removed after &quot; Arabic &quot; call - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots ent@@ enth@@ r@@ alled a media event , after he betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli pre @-@ election since it would have been an Arabic guests according to an employee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his sle@@ ger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by sending an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann was trying to visit Israel on the site of the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; what is it in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel about its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer , which he received there , &quot; scho@@ cked him , &quot; like Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel staff said that the measure is a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
&quot; the reason that it was behind , proceeds in the director even more anger . &quot;
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they asked that the pre @-@ election will be deleted , the accused of Lanz@@ mann was c@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli amb@@ assador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov H@@ adas @-@ Commerce called this a &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied by this event and troubled .
this is really very embarrassing .
&quot; the fact that this is carried in Germany at exactly this hotel chain , is even an even greater shame . &quot;
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; , &quot; said the Am@@ t@@ ate . &quot;
the incident are a fairly big reson@@ ance on the internet where people called the whole a sc@@ andal .
some signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had given the alleged anti @-@ Arab guests .
&quot; ash@@ amed of you , &quot; says it in a different post in which it was noted that the hotel , which is located at the cl@@ assy Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel pointed out all the accus@@ ations of themselves and called the incident an &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; by Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct directive &quot; , &quot; Israel does not record in the fast @-@ op@@ tionally , the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung proclaimed a speaker of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
it adds that the di@@ alling code has been added now .

&quot; the difficulties started , as a police officers tried to examine the students , which led the police Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ ke and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals of the Gover@@ nor &apos;s state of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300,000 students are implemented in order to save money . &quot;
some of the Protest@@ ants see Graf@@ fi@@ ti@@ ts against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er to walls .
&quot; the recent protests took a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the sus@@ pen@@ ed president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , which had been dism@@ issed in the office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian amb@@ assador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade approach between Moscow and T@@ ehr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies participated in stores in the country divided the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors . &quot;
Russian companies have existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
&quot; naturally the further trade fair is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
&quot; he noted that the trade approach between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 will rise by 7@@ 0.2 percent compared with the same period in 2015 , and $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 per cent spr@@ ing@@ ling and amo@@ unted to $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the commercial turn@@ table was reached by deliveries of machinery , land@@ vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; said the Ambassador . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes for this year of a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year , Russian exports were about 35.@@ 000 Vis@@ as , primarily of Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , of Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran achieved the top 20 countries that affects the economy in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record figures of American tourists in Russia will be broken down from the last year , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the Ambassador hopes to change . &quot;
&quot; personally I can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Sh@@ ir@@ az and Y@@ az@@ d , the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition said . &quot;

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hes home as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last evening in the male &apos;s team @-@ Spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory as the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor role , which had made his Land@@ sman Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the young and made the legend proud to have a victory of the favourites in New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympi@@ ag@@ old@@ medals . &quot;
they reiter@@ ated the trick after they took place in March at the Railway World Championships in London despite the return Ho@@ ys only one hum@@ ble sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a execution .
Ho@@ ys reti@@ ring a gap that tried K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton again .
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man , where they stayed when they saw potential in the vill@@ i , which has now un@@ folded . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - which started four years ago with Ho@@ y vict@@ orious - and Sk@@ inner in the qualification round a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord , but in the Stand@@ ar@@ round vict@@ orious the New Ze@@ el@@ ets in the first lap . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; according to his lap , he was just under way back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a great deal of transformation , when giving up a higher gear to slow him and make it Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y saw from his position as a BBC expert and fell to sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y , and Hin@@ des , as those on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am just here to do my best and to make me a name .
in the En@@ dr@@ as we have nominated an Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord and defeated the World Champion .
it was just amazing .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the side Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys called Hin@@ des that he fell to the railway after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no objection of England Ri@@ val .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; &quot; It feels with all the GB fl@@ ags on the ble@@ ach@@ ers like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team over the last three months .
&quot; we have come so badly with so many world @-@ titles , that it was incredible to win again at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , the seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
if the bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months is that we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
&quot; with the shape of Kenn@@ y , it is in the area of Pos@@ sible that he repeated victory of three oly@@ mp@@ ic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; this would be born for Kenn@@ y - who is exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly sacred date for British sports ; on the day , Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster was born ) - a payout of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
the cheese of Ho@@ y equal .
&quot; Kenn@@ y is next in the Spr@@ int , which today begins and will go over three days . &quot;
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the Team @-@ Event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lonely to win alone .
&quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be be@@ aten to the k@@ nights . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medalli@@ sts competition of the day , but there were more good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Br@@ adly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the Vi@@ er @-@ Four Kilom@@ eters race . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
&quot; the world record , which won 2012 in London Gold , was at 3 : 5@@ 0,@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition , where Wig@@ gins will certainly be in focus . &quot;
he had suffered from qualifying before the qualification as they rie@@ ve him to measure his body size .
&quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , the tomorrow continued and ends , av@@ anci@@ ed Laura Des@@ t , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie archives soon of Mil@@ n@@ gav@@ ie in the world time period in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team leaves his strong rail team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and pick up a flock to medals .
after a truly exceptional depic@@ tion of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London were shut down the expectations for Rio .
&quot; it also played Dr@@ amas in the background , so the res@@ ign@@ ation of the technical manager Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex @-@ terrorism and Mob@@ bes , as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one sees itself to the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite then the legendary reputation of GB@@ s , who has reached the perfect moment to be repeated again . &quot;
future of the mel@@ t@@ ment from Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy system
&quot; the future of the aluminum arrows of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as for hundreds of jobs of workers - are standing on the game , since the plant operator will announce the energy supply and thereby real@@ ising all the supply contracts , such as the disp@@ uted energy companies . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant . &quot;
a pay@@ roll for 20 years will run in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the area of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are available on the game .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at a closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to domin@@ ates , as the mel@@ ting sh@@ aker around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as consum@@ es . &quot;
in 2014 Al@@ coa den Point Henry Sch@@ mel@@ t@@ ei led last year to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant .
the mel@@ t@@ ment of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and ris@@ ky a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation in terms of the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity costs for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which serves the large aluminum arrows , served with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared with it that three more owners announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the complex is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , which the Chinese company CIT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p minor shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continues to run that the plant in Port@@ land continues to be operated , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the mel@@ t@@ ment , &quot; shared the company with . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continue to be said that the contracts @-@ called &quot; &quot; hed@@ gers &quot; &quot; were supposed to be into force in November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts do have a 12 @-@ month cancellation period , so that they will end 2017 . &quot;
&quot; from that , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the fiscal year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; said the power supply . &quot;
all potential impact on the revenues on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently restricted by the forecasts of strong terminals for wholesale prices .
&quot; AG@@ L shared with that the value of contracts entered into the amount of $ 187 million in the &quot; &quot; expectation of an cancellation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... the sm@@ mel@@ ting to operate or guarantee the power supply to the mel@@ t@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have entered into effect from November this year , even if there is still a explanation guilty why it has res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
&quot; an@@ al@@ ysts , due to the poor economic relations of the sector before the possible closing of the Port@@ land Sch@@ mel@@ t@@ ery in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle . &quot;
&quot; in reference to the statements of the Analy@@ st in the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land consume around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts . &quot;
&quot; if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as an electricity producer this would be not good , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the sep@@ tum of the Vo@@ gue &quot;

&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this Co@@ vers was written , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the unvei@@ ling of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans like this ? ) , soci@@ able Reality video , which provides the cover of her sister ( with exception of the problem , Rob and Ca@@ it@@ lyn as well as in the presence of the most popular show@@ biz On@@ k@@ els and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) and that ends with a classic che@@ er : they all have a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the clever act of nearly every birthday sep@@ tum ( Se@@ ac@@ rest led the sentence , &quot; you should have forgotten that we would have forgotten you ? &quot; , with the honest@@ y of a cartoon on 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to take part in this public@@ city somehow . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September Issu@@ es , the Vo@@ gue has certainly started a new era of the Car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls great sister Kim she likes to see what the Vo@@ gue cover cover , be@@ aten ( her and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue is a League for itself . &quot;

&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resem@@ bles rather a picture band as a fashion , the output draws a large number of adverti@@ sers to ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista ) from the 8@@ 32 pages of the grove 615 pages advertising ) . &quot;
&quot; the unvei@@ ling of his cover stars will be so cute , that in the last two years images of the magazine can still be passed from the official announcement . &quot;
&quot; women who were already on the cover , Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ rities , the modeling &quot; as &quot; Models , the celeb@@ rities &quot; are &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar @-@ winner and Di@@ or @-@ brand amb@@ assador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even at the low chance that Mrs. J@@ den@@ omin@@ ator is described as the &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; of its generation - under the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot;
&quot; these celeb@@ rities are not related to famous people , or Reality stars or young people of today who know how to apply a good snap@@ chat video ( even if it all apply to den@@ omin@@ ator ) . &quot;
they are truly talented women who are out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade of one of the most successful years of their career . &quot;
&quot; of course , Jenn@@ ers will not like everyone . &quot;

in June criti@@ ci@@ zed the embedded Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ omin@@ ator and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called them &quot; the Mist@@ y of the Eye . &quot;
&quot; these feelings were once again high , when the message with the show Jenn@@ ers came out on the Vo@@ gue Cover . &quot;

&quot; municipal centres every year , over 160,000 people &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0,000 of the aid con@@ fig@@ s of the country will be rejected every year by the municipal centres every year , while the industry is focusing on the effects of other medium @-@ ranging transactions over already over@@ load transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland it is already three of five persons - mostly older people , immigrants , aid in need of violence , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just Del@@ o@@ gi@@ vings and similar products - with their request on free legal advice and legal advis@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already out@@ sour@@ ced , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; from June next year , the legal centers will become more than 30 percent of their resources . &quot;
&quot; the Director of the Municip@@ ality centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said , that the last survey of the National Association of municipal centres revealed that thousands of people will be rejected each year . &quot;
&quot; Far@@ rell said , the situation without lifting the decisions of the federal government would only become worse . &quot;
&quot; que@@ ens@@ ory centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people of important services that you need to be refused . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and pressing debts , families , who have been dism@@ issed by divi@@ ders - all these people have problems of a legal way , and this survey shows that they do not need the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government will cut the funds for 30 percent in June 2017 , which means thousands of aid needs to be forced out of Queensland with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call for the Gener@@ ators and Federal Justice Minister as well as sen@@ ators from Queensland George Bran@@ dis to rise up to these mid@@ ations , so that people can obtain the help they need in legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government filled its promises , means for leg@@ sh@@ il@@ fen to the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to see the needs of the community centers and their customers , as well as the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k to invest in this important work . &quot;

&quot; the incident is described in a indic@@ t@@ ment , which was submitted to the Wednesday Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software programming for the campaign in this federal state . &quot;
&quot; Bord@@ ini had waited to have been long awa@@ ited , that the matter would be regulated internally before it re@@ alizes that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries @-@ elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , there are considerable losses for the government &apos;s parties and CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; these are representative of the opinion of the opinion of opinion , IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black government @-@ operation in the north is slightly more to the rule , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and thereby have good chances to continue the government &apos;s government . &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD clim@@ bed from 35,@@ 6 percent to 24 percent before the age of five .
&quot; according to the survey , the party has just under the CD@@ U back to 23 percent before the CD@@ U . &quot;
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; left by 19 per cent ( formerly 18,@@ 4 per cent ) , the Af@@ D would be present with 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s day . &quot;
&quot; in spite of slight losses with 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) again , again in the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not represent 3 percent in the country &apos;s day .
&quot; in the event of the Berlin Convention , the SPD of the survey was estimated that only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28,@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U got only 18 percent to 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; they are still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 per cent ( formerly 11,@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be present at 14 percent for the first time in the company &apos;s office .
&quot; with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope to return to a return , the pirates would be missed in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and Internet in Tim@@ l@@ upe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to market .
the successor today domin@@ ate the world - his producer lived a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed nearly a half kil@@ ograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and larger ; therefore it was not good in the hand .
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite kno@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fs with high resolution . &quot;
a iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 Gig@@ abyte .
&quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in business - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros lovers can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the st@@ one@@ age of the dormit@@ ory switch . &quot;
but 20 years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the C@@ eb@@ it trade fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; office in the west @-@ case format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could send a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even access to web pages was possible by HTML @-@ browser , if also agon@@ izing slow . &quot;
a pocket rech@@ ner was available ; a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
&quot; there was a small ant@@ enna , and the mobile phone could work similar to a laptop . &quot;
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ white @-@ screen .
&quot; quite proud of the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was in 2015 at 3@@ 92 Euro .
nobody was able to fl@@ ags in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the cell @-@ card of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft and undertaken . &quot;
the market today domin@@ ate the market that all came a lot later than Nokia .
&quot; always and everywhere , this is today for quite a lot of people . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; sold around 1,@@ 4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple are falling into 555 million copies . &quot;
global sales with the devices is approximately 400 billion euros .
&quot; to do this , the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies are included . &quot;
around the smartphone has written a whole industry in the meantime .
&quot; the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple @-@ MD announced Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet communication , easy to use by touch screen . &quot;
&quot; the winner of Apple began , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who controlled the market , had the rep@@ ay@@ ment . &quot;
they eventually disappeared ; Black@@ berry has to fight .
now these are now Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention a matter of course .
&quot; in the cut today , each German now looks like 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to lay the smartphone also once again , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina ball , in the Siemens Committee for Personal Information . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now regarded as cur@@ se and blessing at the same time .
England must draw the oly@@ mp@@ ic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw won &apos;t only be moved to our local municipalities and all over London but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity .
&quot; for me it was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , as well as at that time in 2012 in London , when we took a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought big advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be reached again by setting up new possibilities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw new possibilities .
&quot; for our local communities , we will already invest 10,000 new appr@@ enti@@ ces to create new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too big . &quot;
&quot; I was told that England will never be ready for the games , and that we will bl@@ am@@ ate on the world stage . &quot;
the two @-@ two had injustice and they will also be wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; there are always obstacles to dis@@ appearance , but He@@ a@@ throw answers each of him . &quot;
as the Olympic Games is He@@ a@@ throw for many and not for individual structured project .
&quot; expansion is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to wit@@ ty growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both in the airport and across the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has been converted to a £ 11 billion &apos;s infrastructure programme in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport checks until T2 , which was built in the midst of the two frequ@@ ented run@@ ners of the world . &quot;
now they are ready to deliver a third run@@ way which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw is also one .
&quot; it is time to draw this oly@@ mp@@ ic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw , as well as creating our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs , to be proud of the Great Britain . &quot;

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; &quot; regarding ad @-@ block &quot;
&quot; for companies who earn money with online @-@ making money , according to one of the software manufacturers try to cope with an &quot; &quot; kitt@@ ens and mouse game &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block off on its desktop page , released Ad@@ block Plus a blog@@ post , in which it re@@ mitt@@ ent that users may update their filters in the program to block again advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared with that its Des@@ kt@@ op@@ page would change the en@@ coding on its advertisements to identify it indication elev@@ ations the recognition of what part of page advertising is to complain . &quot;
but Ad@@ block proclaimed that there has found a new way to deal with the new codes .
&quot; in a blog@@ post , the speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ battle between the early @-@ time open source community and the res@@ h@@ ers have already been underway since the invention of ad lock@@ ers in progress , and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world @-@ largest company for social media has left in the fight , is a powerful indication of how worrying indicators has become the industry . &quot;
&quot; according to a study last year by Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people , display towels ; almost four times as much 2013 . &quot;
&quot; about 20 billion daily users who access Facebook on their mobile devices , makes hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung 84 percent of the advertising revenue generated . &quot;
&quot; the company has no effect on display lock@@ ers on desktop PCs , since mobile ad orders have no effect on fac@@ ebook mobile app for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , divided an speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on Desktop PCs makes a sufficient big share of revenue , so that Facebook will appear in one step as rewar@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared with that it would be its &quot; &quot; ad tool &quot; &quot; to update the people more control over them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday I maintained Facebook , that adding new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the page which are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for users this is not a positive experience , therefore we plan to address the problem , distributed a spokes@@ person from Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; Ad In@@ struc@@ tor are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we concentrated on development tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
Mrs with suspected su@@ ic@@ ide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
&quot; the police calls us witnesses even after a woman in the early hours of the morning , on Thursday during an suspected self @-@ term su@@ ic@@ ide by several vehicles on a highway . &quot;
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman slept in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the road and were taken by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a swe@@ at at the age of 49 , including a truck , including a lor@@ ry , even wanted to kill . &quot;
it still died on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not identified yet , the police , which also calls for every witness of the incident to sign up . &quot;
&quot; it was opened a investig@@ ational method , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter , the Le Trib@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot;
was a cl@@ ash avoidable ?
&quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accountable .
&quot; in each of the two cases - where a person went on the highway on the highway - was decided that motor@@ cyclists don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian falls right in the night on the motorway , as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
last year a polic@@ eman had acqu@@ itted off after they had a man over@@ ride and killed who was in August 2014 a night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sacrifice had drunk and has grown on the road , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the court proved that the polic@@ eman had responded to a justified manner -- on a justified manner , and that the presence of a man on the road had an &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predic@@ table situation &quot; , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday in Morges , should deal with the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA Klim@@ amo@@ del : Venus was once hab@@ itable
Venus was likely to be used according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate amo@@ d@@ ells probably once .
&quot; scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by tools and algorithms , which are similar to those of climate research . &quot;
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether Venus won with its hot , waterproof surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once created similar conditions . &quot;
scientists previously pointed out that the slow transformation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere and slowly moved on . &quot;
the model also illumin@@ ates the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet was presum@@ ably more dry areas than the earth , but had once enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to appeal to life and shr@@ ank before faster tasting . &quot;
&quot; the early Venus prof@@ ited from an Sun , which is 30 percent of matter . &quot;
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simul@@ ations exp@@ ose the slow @-@ turn of Venus by the sun nearly two months long , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as a rainy layer , to the surface of a large proportion of sun war@@ ms . &quot;
the result are average @-@ temperatures that are some degree of cooler than the Earth today .
&quot; the model brought forth a history of Venus that was similar to the evolution , which previously assumed by Plan@@ etary research . &quot;
&quot; although it was probably inhabited , the Venus -- in the course of several billion years --@@ zu@@ red heat and ultr@@ avi@@ olet light was exposed . &quot;
their oceans ver@@ dark and their water v@@ ap@@ or was dri@@ lled from the ultr@@ avi@@ olet light .
&quot; as its hydro@@ gen , it remained only a thick atmosphere at carbon dioxide from a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate amo@@ d@@ ells in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .

we will hold some full @-@ day meetings in the coming weeks which will start the beginning next year to tackle the problems .
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
wood Group has shorten@@ ed to its contrac@@ tu@@ ators in North Sea by about 9 percent due to a negative market pressure .
the advis@@ ers of the company follows a 10 @-@ process decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company are needed to get through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; shell has released for his part of thousands of people and announced plans to aband@@ on its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it gives its business activities as a result of its m@@ um@@ re@@ union with the British energy company BG Group ration@@ alized .
&quot; due to the lower cost of energy prices under pressure , economic situation , which have been abandoned by the decision of the British in June , the European Union . &quot;
the Scottish Parliament member Dave Ander@@ son met with workers &apos; leader in the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest working disputes that took place since a generation in the North Sea .
&quot; North Sea is important for the regional economy , &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy which works for many and not only for a few , he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1,@@ 4 billion will be expected to invest some $ 7 billion in the North Sea by an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures Rot@@ ation rate of stars in star@@ ry of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
&quot; the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler &apos;s space tel@@ esc@@ ope has helped astronom@@ ers to gather the ful@@ ler catalogue on Rot@@ ation , among the stars of the star@@ chy . &quot;
&quot; the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the constell@@ ation are at different ran@@ ates , as well as in what context the rotation periods with the planning process . &quot;
&quot; we hope that we find out through the compar@@ isons of our results with other star@@ enh@@ ances , read more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star@@ ry of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is located 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this constell@@ ation , emerged above 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
it is now turning at the fastest .
&quot; to peak , this att@@ acking stars come from a large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; since this win@@ ch can travel through the mag@@ net fields of stars , they have an ins@@ ure effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is alter@@ t , its rotation starts to dec@@ eler@@ ate . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by demonstrating the time between the appearance of an recognizable star@@ ch@@ equ@@ es -- like sun@@ spot -- recognis@@ es .
the latest catalogue of rotation rates points out that more massive stars are slower than a few massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ters as smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors to tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the constell@@ ation of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades so close is , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare as well as rot@@ ational qualities . &quot;
&quot; the star@@ ry of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades provides an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still much ahead of us and we would like to learn more about how the wh@@ ann and why stars slow their rotation , and say their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and their colleagues reported in three newspaper report on their latest analysis of the Ple@@ j@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star comes from
the tears helped by Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the U.S. Bas@@ eball @-@ Star in the best days from Base to Base .
&quot; following his emotional return announcement , the 41 year old pro @-@ announ@@ cements will take place on August 12 against the Tampa Bay R@@ ays a last time the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Good@@ bye &quot; to the &quot; &quot; explained the 14 @-@ mal@@ ige All @-@ star @-@ Game Members of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player by the League , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series . &quot;
his signature under a tenth year contract has signed him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
&quot; by the end of the contrast , on 31 December 2017 , he worked as a consultant and youth coach - with full content . &quot;
as a player there are Rodri@@ guez for a long time with performance .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 Hits and 2021 Points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ us &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es made some mil@@ estones . &quot;
with the Hall of Fame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays only point two other bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics similar values .
&quot; but in the cru@@ m@@ ness of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls the 41 @-@ year @-@ old , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be recorded . &quot;
&quot; because so successfully Rodri@@ guez - Nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field was , so disp@@ uted his appearance outside of the pl@@ aza . &quot;
&quot; already 2009 the Super@@ star announced at &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 passed the Ster@@ o@@ ids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
in August 2013 he was locked due to a dec@@ eption in the so @-@ called E@@ thesis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 for 211 parti@@ te .
Rodri@@ guez is considered a major suspic@@ ious for years to have received a anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
after a dispute the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; the league could even have done for the year 2014 even a favor , because I had played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez was then sweet . &quot;
even his f@@ arewell days do not go straight .
while many Bas@@ eball legends in their last play once again got the big stage had to sit Rodri@@ guez frequently on the bank .
&quot; my job does not include the f@@ arewell tour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win each game , &quot; estimated Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all Rodri@@ guez , who was married to the actress Cameron Di@@ az and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson briefly , sympathy for fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first disp@@ ens@@ ations . &quot;
caught : because of a positive D@@ op@@ ing@@ test may not start weight fever Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ es .
a caught Ath@@ l@@ ete could have gained almost one medal .
&quot; before the seventh day competition , the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ es were known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer@@ in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacles from Bulgaria and the Polish weight fever Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the case @-@ critical athle@@ tics competitions come this news at the time of time . &quot;
at Ch@@ en &apos;s last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic @-@ hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de has been proven to be used as a mas@@ cot medication .
&quot; the International Sport@@ Tribunal , confirmed on Friday afternoon at the time of the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took place the fourth place in the finals over 100 m butter@@ fly , just around 0,@@ 09 seconds , she finished the bronze medals . &quot;
on Friday Ch@@ en would have to participate in the courses over 50 m Fre@@ isti@@ l .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ trial at the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) .
&quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands a full cooperation among the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ Tribunal , and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history is no longer the I@@ OC , but the CAS for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also at night of Rio oo@@ ked the news about the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on to the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; they may be inno@@ cent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is expected to act in the dec@@ aying substance to the blood @-@ offering EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ owa was temporarily sus@@ pen@@ ded , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ rehear@@ sal should also be positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s prime minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w immediately got criticism of the ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the ath@@ l@@ ete does not move the right conclusions , &quot; said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , about all weights from the chron@@ ically @-@ offering nation may not be held in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the case of &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; was announced in the class until 85 kg such as his brother Tomas@@ z tested three days before the an@@ ab@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both unden@@ i@@ able the intake , however , both may not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of light athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another difficult blow for the reputation of the entire sport . &quot;
&quot; the World Association IA@@ AF had the complete Russian crew until an exception because of system@@ atic dop@@ ing the start prohibited , even the L@@ äu@@ er Kenya produced in Rio numerous bad news . &quot;
in the swimming pool the former publishers in China had also taken care of fier@@ cely disputes between athletes .
thus the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t the Chinese Olympi@@ asi@@ eger Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ isti@@ l , I want to pass , &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also at the centre of a debate with the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ oping &quot; , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun was positive in 2014 with the Chinese champi@@ on@@ ships , on the stimul@@ ant of the Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din stimul@@ us , but had to sit only a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
Dat@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ pres@@ sing h@@ ackers your ran@@ som
programmers of ext@@ or@@ tion @-@ mal@@ ware are currently targeted companies - and they are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey of mal@@ ware best@@ cles specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surv@@ ey@@ ed companies were sold at least once , partly several victims of an attack with black@@ mailing software . &quot;
in Germany almost 20 percent of companies have already been the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims paid will@@ ingly those of the perpet@@ rators demanded to use the challenged systems and data to be used again .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their black@@ pres@@ ser software according to observations from Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; if they succeed there , the potentially promising ran@@ som is significantly higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently monitoring a start@@ ling fast evolution of damage software , &quot; &quot; Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski explains in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 2008 most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then we discovered the off@@ ender software for themselves .
&quot; first , private users had the goal , but the change to company att@@ acken has been terri@@ fying fast in the past months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware is working after a simple pattern : once on the computer of an optional , it is targeted to in@@ ju@@ red files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as to archives pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
then the software presents the requirements of the press releases .
&quot; to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims need money - usually in form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where in private users , the personal photo database is on the game , the companies are about sensitive customers or project databases , without which the production is shut down . &quot;
accordingly higher is the damage when a ran@@ som@@ ware suggests .
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German companies melt sales by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had even had to break down the business , in a case of men were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , many hospitals in Germany were victims of attack , whose patients may be threatened by loss of sick . &quot;
&quot; we say the sacrific@@ es always : do not pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; says Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , their data will get back . &quot;
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rators in the face of breast@@ feeding .
the h@@ ackers again know that and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure exam@@ ines the user surfaces and the contact with the black@@ mail@@ ers and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to establish a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their sacrific@@ es by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , direct accessible support sites or de@@ code for example files . &quot;
&quot; and are a private busin@@ es@@ sman according to payments of a few hundred billion euros , businesses have to pay well and pay five @-@ dig@@ it sums in order to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively risk of profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ acker gets more and more professional and share the work , explains security exper@@ t@@ ew@@ ski from the Anti@@ virus provider Sophos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within one week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is however that it is about three or four people . &quot;
the programmers sell their damage software then in the form of a software building to the actual black@@ mailing lists .
&quot; the previous mal@@ ware kits were created by drawing mal@@ ware , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; included in delivery is an adaptation tool , so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and brand@@ ing can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ presses are then looking for more h@@ ackers to spread the fresh software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so you log@@ ged in one of the forums in the underground , buy the set of a crime and commissioned a further way to install the software on as many PCs . &quot;
the payment is processed per in@@ correctly calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als bear sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies who better manage their data .
more than 50 percent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey with file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ ation software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful earnings , the perpet@@ rators will be stated instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; &quot; Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; thus , the damage will be potential for the type of data to be a variety of times higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpet@@ rators could continue to take completely new goals on the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con illustrated security researchers , as they were able to get control of their control with the Internet . &quot;
in the middle of winter the lock of such non @-@ aligned heating as man@@ chem victims can certainly be a ran@@ som .
&quot; if the perpet@@ rators then block the heating in the future a whole manufacturing road block in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware might also become an issue in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all accounts
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and functional @-@ dust
&quot; in the little HR @-@ V , Honda will pack everything : a little SU@@ V , a little cou@@ p@@ é and even the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the small HR @-@ V is relatively small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the bond , it does not affect any place . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior space are well finished and work pleasant , just the cock@@ pit @-@ surface is something off . &quot;
versatile use than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in storage space .
&quot; it is not only a trunk of 45@@ 3 l with high @-@ made back and 10@@ 26 l back , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical , when it sounds : the sitting areas of the back@@ seat can be found like Kin@@ os@@ essel top @-@ valves and thus offer storage space that is high from the ground up to the ceiling 1,@@ 24 m . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be well loaded , however the char@@ ger with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel diesel oil with 88 kW / 120 HP speeds up the HR @-@ V thanks to torque range up to 300 Nm in large @-@ speed ranges very powerful .
he should leave his work somewhat more qui@@ eter .
&quot; pleas@@ ing is the patient &apos;s consumption of 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km . &quot;
there is yet another motorcycle : a 1,5 @-@ l gas@@ oline with 96 kW / 130 HP .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; driving behaviour is balanced , good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
&quot; however , the steering is likely to be a little direct . &quot;
&quot; the equipment is open in the top &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; top &quot; &quot; button . &quot;
&quot; for the safety systems , the City @-@ Not@@ bre@@ ms@@ assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ ision system and the trace super@@ visor . &quot;
&quot; the coll@@ ision war@@ ner sometimes , because he rated many obstacles as &quot; her@@ edit@@ ary objects . &quot; &quot;
very reliable works on the remote @-@ site assistant .
and the intelligent Tem@@ por@@ ator respon@@ ds to the traffic detection and d@@ ros@@ es when needed the speed .
&quot; however , the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More . &quot;
&quot; two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest , and therefore are somewhat aw@@ k@@ ward to reach . &quot;
the approximately 29@@ 000 euros for the well equipped top Diesel are fine .
&quot; who does not want to invest so much , the gas@@ oline receives from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ 000 Euro . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 @-@ gas norm .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and all @-@ day car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable for over@@ throwing on air passengers
an air@@ line is not liable for the overthrow of a Pass@@ enger on the Air@@ bridge .
&quot; because a liability is conceivable only with haz@@ ards , which is typical of air traffic , argu@@ ed the Upper District Court Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken up with the overthrow a knee @-@ drink .
&quot; however , the accident could have been happening all over the world - it is a general risk of living , so the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
disease case : when is paid by the operator
&quot; after their journey , holi@@ day@@ makers get only money back when the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ less free to find in the hotel . &quot;
but that is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests will show the same symptoms .
&quot; in the sealed case , a family was hard on the second day of their tur@@ qu@@ ur@@ l@@ ery hard to diar@@ rho@@ ea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
their disease led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a defensive situation which alleg@@ edly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family was the view that he had been lack of lack - and def@@ endant against the promot@@ ers .
in court the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had no success .
although the frac@@ tional situation was indeed broken .
but the organis@@ er went just before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff .
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; thus , he did not hurt his information , so the judgment . &quot;
especially since in the rehear@@ sals of the water no contam@@ ination were found .
&quot; the illness of several hotel guests - perhaps , due to infection from each other - belong to the general lifestyle risk . &quot;
from 6@@ 91 guests there were only 38 days .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said to the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach in July many people had worried about further attacks .
the state sin@@ uns and decided to react at the same time to the terrorist attack .
surely it is : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hat@@ red and split .
this triumph we will not treat the terrorists .
&quot; if it would have to leave the country faster , this will be the safety and the approval of the people for refugee policy . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère aims to implement the proposals by proposals to the Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced a further personal strengthening of security forces , and in medium @-@ sized magnitude over several years . &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be under punishment again .
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the weapon was quite so novel@@ ty that especially the purchase of weapons on the internet is complicated . &quot;
the last much discussed Schwei@@ ge@@ elight for doctors shall remain spirit@@ ually after de Ma@@ izi@@ ères .
&quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the doctors of trouble , such as the haz@@ ard of citizens can be reduced , he said with a look about psych@@ ic symptoms . &quot;
&quot; to counter a radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the Minister maintains a better social support necessary . &quot;
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traum@@ atis@@ ed people .
&quot; in order to prosec@@ uting crimin@@ als in special fields of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of fr@@ ame@@ works . &quot;
&quot; SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to improving safety . &quot;
it is important that the Interior clearly spoke against action .
&quot; this was a ear @-@ file for the sni@@ per in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of Fun@@ ke ME@@ DI@@ ENG@@ RU@@ P@@ PE ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had re@@ pro@@ hibition of the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and dism@@ issed the abolition of double taxation .
a generic ban of fully @-@ wearing it is constitu@@ tionally problematic .
&quot; you cannot give everything what you re@@ jects , and I Leh@@ ne the Tr@@ ay of the Bur@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; talk about rules about road @-@ road , or for witnesses to the court . &quot;
&quot; green chief manager Simone Peter cast out the Minister , he wants to simul@@ ate with ever new anti @-@ terror packages and action . &quot;
&quot; Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; Pro@@ verb@@ s and a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the residen@@ cy on the right bring people in this country no more security . &quot;
better traffic flu@@ x on the motorway
this is a regular basis on the road linking - here a picture of November .
&quot; however , that is to change : the legal capacity is to be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all the car of the driver , who are at stake in professional traffic on the ambient road every night in the St@@ au , when they pass over the motorway , Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; the establishment of the road building is extended to the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer Street and the departure Wes@@ eler Street , the right @-@ in track to 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then pull right from the hammer street right .
&quot; the great advantage : the traffic shares breakfast , thus improving overall the course on the complex section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U fac@@ tion in the district of the agency Münster @-@ West .
the driver @-@ ground@@ ing on the fe@@ eder is annoying the car @-@ driver above all between 17 and 7 pm .
on week@@ days from the back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes also beyond .
the N@@ adel@@ öh@@ r is located on B 51 shortly before the departure Wes@@ eler Straße .
&quot; from here , traffic can only be accompanied via the Motor@@ way . &quot;
the second track had to be re@@ constructed along well in three years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had revealed that the bridge has no longer the required force , in order to absor@@ b especially the heavy @-@ duty traffic . &quot;
&quot; however , how long this bott@@ ling and the associated state of St@@ au will not say , the relevant regional operation cannot be said . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to reck@@ on , because the bridge has an official rest@@ less duration of up to the year 2034 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal atten@@ de@@ ur , the state of affairs deliberately sought the busi@@ est period in school holidays because with disabilities is to be expected . &quot;
the traffic will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural journey : cultural activities for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theater piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the Association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a musical project .
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s allows young people to visit with a migration and refugee background , cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
the &quot; class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has a vision of the award @-@ winning camp &quot; The invisible house &quot; of the boy Theater Münster .
in the context of the Association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; we visited 19 students between eleven and 15 years of st@@ aging in the little house .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with an immig@@ rant and refugee background , schools with welcome classes the possibility to visit within this project cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most of the young people of the class were made between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria made a little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the choreo@@ graphi@@ es , the scene of images and video animations it might have been possible to follow the scope of action , so the press release of the boy Theater Münster . &quot;

rain instead of stars : hope for weather better
the weather has made the star@@ ters Gu@@ ck@@ ers in the South@@ west of Germany at night to Friday a rich through the invoice - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night is bad for clouds and rain bad for it to observe the heavenly spectacle , said the President of the Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night for Saturday .
&quot; the weather is to be good , then we certainly see many star@@ ters in the sky . &quot;
&quot; with the star@@ ters , it is per@@ sei@@ zing that belong to 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the fastest star @-@ type . &quot;
&quot; they have their name because they appear seemingly from the constell@@ ation of Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the northeast . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for in@@ dis@@ rup@@ tions
&quot; in the evening , one finds himself forever , at night one is lying awake , in the morning , it is already far before the W@@ eck@@ er@@ ring no longer to think . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently un@@ relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there may be diverse causes , Hans @-@ Günter We@@ aving , Member of the German Society for Schlaf@@ forschung and Schlaf@@ Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what you understand by it , is the in@@ som@@ nia , so it is an input and a sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; right now , many people find as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , Member @-@ member of the German Haus@@ smann association with practice in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep are complex .
&quot; behind it , organic , psych@@ ical or non @-@ conditioned factors , but also medications are stuck . &quot;
it is not rare that the in@@ sol@@ ation expression is an expression of another disease .
&quot; very early w@@ aking up is mostly on depression , &quot; says We@@ aving . &quot;
and it may be that various factors make each other possible .
&quot; who , for example , has a absor@@ ber attack , can lie poor@@ ly all two to three hours and begins to greet you about everyday problems and to greet , there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when one should consult with sleeping disorders ?
&quot; who is not well cared for over a period of a month at least three nights per week and is not affected by the day , should go to the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the impair@@ ment can look quite differently : one is be@@ aten , tired , un@@ ri@@ pped , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has m@@ oods or physical symptoms such as stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to so@@ othing the sleep , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; as treatment options occur , among other things behaviour changes , a cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medication - classical sle@@ eves , only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ convenience . &quot;
&quot; approved sleep : he hardly has to be stressed in Germany , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary team of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one should first contact the household problems first at the primary care doctor . &quot;
this can be clari@@ fied by exam@@ inations if the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go into the dormit@@ ories , and what happens there ? &quot;
&quot; to investigate in the dormit@@ ory medicine , for example with snor@@ ing with respir@@ atory tract , with sleeping @-@ sensitive daily fatigue , or if you do not find the cause of a dis@@ jun@@ k , &quot; &quot; Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in fact , one does not need to prepare for the study . &quot;
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not make a mid@@ day , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after going , one goes to the bed of his normal time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the electro@@ des at the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a f@@ itter on the finger . &quot;
&quot; additionally , a camera is characterized by the ceiling to the sleep . &quot;
how can sufferers have the problems get a grip on ?
there are quite a lot of adjust@@ s on which one can set for a better sleep .
&quot; we@@ aves counts on : regular sleeping @-@ times , not too long in bed , not to sleep on the day , do not watch TV to sleep , alcohol li@@ ds and at night not to watch the clock - then one starts immediately to count , and that is quite and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jun@@ k camp with missing medals in swimming has to be
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus D@@ ei@@ bler released by Facebook to dis@@ appoint the D@@ SV team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he held gold for the first time in Doha at the short time Championship and presented his first world record at the same time .
now the former D@@ SV @-@ Ath@@ l@@ ete Markus D@@ ei@@ lle on Facebook ro@@ ar@@ cher in front of his in the criticism of the former ex @-@ team mates .
&quot; in a country where an Olympi@@ asi@@ eger 20,000 € premi@@ er receives and a jungle kö@@ nig 15@@ 0.000 € should not be surprised about missing medals , wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on the night on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in the swimming pool is bad , the D@@ op@@ ing@@ ual control is very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries which do not promote a lot , and don &apos;t even have to look at the issue of dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I do not say that the controls are to be adjusted , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before its first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is how one should hold it with other countries too .
&quot; those who cannot be controlled a certain time before the World Cup / OS from independent insp@@ ectors of the W@@ ada / F@@ ina may not participate , calling the choice of Hamburg , who meanwhile operates a Eis@@ el@@ ele . &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of Che@@ ats det@@ ects
professional di@@ ebe at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , the Düsseldorf police succeeded in the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years . &quot;
the in@@ suspic@@ i@@ ously had committed as ban@@ de several bu@@ ckl@@ es and che@@ ap@@ ed ste@@ els .
&quot; against 21.@@ 30h civil officials in the area of Düsseldorf , Düsseldorf a gang again , known for the police officers of the past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men have been committed since the middle of July this year , and were a collaborative , job @-@ lab@@ eled and particularly professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the crime novel@@ ty 34 can follow the th@@ iev@@ es of crimes of crimes in Germany , and four acts . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they had been exploited in a total of over 15.000 Euro . &quot;
&quot; ancient buildings , a few lenses , some left @-@ rock @-@ fo@@ wl : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ fried@@ rich@@ sha@@ im acts at first sight not so , but the police are one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; one goes along the road from east to west , one gets over to play , a fres@@ her nursery and a Bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
to the facade of a gray house someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot;
&quot; opposite to a Li@@ dl , who will soon be demol@@ ished , it is already built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new rentals . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; trendy district &quot; , &quot; as the competent real estate company coll@@ ectiv@@ ly sha@@ ved , however , in recent weeks , however , preferred cars to be preferred . &quot;
&quot; the house is occupied with the number 94 : once it was occupied , now the inhabitants have le@@ ases , on the ground floor are still open spaces and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior H@@ enk@@ el had repeatedly called for a tough action of police against the project , the region as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after 22 June the rooms were vac@@ ated on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers and three teams on site , par@@ ked parts of the road and kept visitors to enter the house with the number 94 . &quot;
meanwhile the renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown land@@ owners the rooms .
&quot; on July 13 , a Berlin administrative court decided that the clearance was illegal , and one day later passed the police and construction workers under the jubil@@ ee of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the street peac@@ ef@@ ull : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking vor@@ m Sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house@@ work there is a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; left violence is not the main or@@ ge of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lived in the area since 1999 , and Jana * , who lived here three children , are mainly inspired by the police presence . &quot;
with the inhabitants of the house@@ work they share the concern of rising ten@@ ants and cent@@ ri@@ fication .
&quot; it does not sound like a pine , who would like a multi @-@ uni@@ fying political protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ on on the left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , who make the Berlin interior and the police between the occup@@ ants and their neighbors , does not exist so . &quot;
&quot; peaceful sha@@ ies in the East of Berlin actually was a traditional working @-@ quarter , which also has a lower average rate today in comparison to the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; also house poss@@ essor and the resulting home projects already belong to the pine tree : 1990 , numerous houses have been occupied in the former GDR , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer street very close to the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Mainz had been vac@@ ated in a down@@ right street , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Rig@@ a@@ er and are partly inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district of the city has become increasingly on the mag@@ net for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world : with them now inhabitants of the GDR and former home countries share their pine trees . &quot;
&quot; this is also noticeable in the rent , which has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
&quot; many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ s are attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them on the printed sli@@ ces or fresh kn@@ itted fac@@ ades , which were be@@ g with colour explo@@ si@@ ves . &quot;
no other street was mentioned so many times together with the words &quot; &quot; left @-@ aut@@ on@@ ome violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a reason that not all neighbours may be seen as problem , may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as bodily injury are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the biggest part of criminal off@@ ences make an atomic damage , which tend to meet more and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lived for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as far as violence is concerned , the people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been determined . &quot;
also the famous burning cars will not give it directly into the Rig@@ at@@ ter longer .
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a crime burning , on the contrary . &quot; &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately moved to the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße .
&quot; this is why it was also so important that the inhabitants get back their street : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly stressed the interpretation of the district in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : by disp@@ at@@ ched new@@ buildings in former buildings that push the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately con@@ formity , which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well known , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I not appro@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but what should one do , if a never listen to someone ? &quot;
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides of fru@@ stration , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for sugar drawn , those interested in colour@@ ful bom@@ bs , Ker@@ stin has a little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belong to the pine tree . &quot;
&quot; who go down , should be aware of it - just like someone who can complain in a pub quarter , that bad about noise can complain there . &quot;
&quot; all persons only provided with first names had asked , do not be called with their right name . &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the Ansprech@@ partner@@ in in terms of integration and organizer .
&quot; in addition , she is a social worker on the spot . &quot;
since July Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the refugee for Ur@@ bach .
social ped@@ agog@@ ics supports the management team in order to manage Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working @-@ free refugees , administration , public authorities and who else is concerned . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine Client from the working circle indicates that the volunteer is more than grateful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the eag@@ erly Woll@@ ish@@ au which primarily has a problem . &quot;
&quot; so , some - less sp@@ ott@@ ful as much as the multitude of tasks would be pur@@ pos@@ eful - meant , when the administration wanted to write the place . &quot;
&quot; was a administrative division with a talent for languages and people , connected with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a progressive Woll@@ ish@@ au . &quot;
&quot; however , administrative work is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; most of all it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network strength . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been around for around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent position on three years of duration .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ our@@ ing and full @-@ full actors support . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
soon new containers are available at the washing @-@ road
&quot; a serious problem has been found for some time , flats for connecting people who have been acknowledged . &quot;
for the connection , the municipalities are responsible . &quot;
you must put refugees in their own or log@@ ged living rooms .
&quot; the cost of construction , rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the land@@ rat@@ ch@@ as in the Comm@@ une and J@@ ob@@ center .
problem : there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search for some time has been very difficult for some time .
de facto there is no private apartments .
&quot; so far , it does not work so you rely on private apartments , so di@@ eu@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the common apartments must be controlled as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so soon , new containers will soon be placed in the washing road . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , the Reg@@ ine Kunde and Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed B@@ lei@@ be , there are internship places , training courses , training courses , a euro @-@ jobs and educational activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building or help domestic ma@@ stered , do charitable work - and this motivated and very neat , like Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive outlook .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; occupation , but not only work . &quot;
&quot; the day spent a firm structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so do all offers like sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are r@@ ar .
so we also jump in management and volunteer .
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are appreciated in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the trial is a problem .
&quot; you must declare to the refugees that it just takes and they can rep@@ ay the time useful , for example , with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who at some point the feeling is developing , he could not help in Ur@@ bach don &apos;t want to work and be unn@@ ütz , who will never be integrated . &quot;
the marked majority is motivated .
&quot; but problem happens , however , says customer honest , &quot; people , where nothing is doing . &quot; the work of deu@@ ces and customers are therefore always to motiv@@ ate others too . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : have the two according to recent occurr@@ ences are afraid of radi@@ cal@@ isation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine Kunde says quite clearly , &quot; what man@@ cher nai@@ ve call . &quot; a Res@@ tr@@ isi@@ ko could and would not want it out . &quot;
sensi@@ ti@@ zed are the assistant but already .
these inci@@ dents are also the subject of the refugees .
they had the fear that the attacks bring them completely in call .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , main - and volunteer is to be held on site and in the region of activities . &quot;
they always have in the background that soon a new Sto@@ ß could come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a ceiling ?
that question clearly to answer is the politics .
&quot; actually , it is unfair to place it hel@@ pers on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not yet arrived , where we would like to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , this would be able to relax . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that Ur@@ bacher have already dealt with , the previous people are reasonable . &quot;
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in distress , you need them to help them agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complex , because there is no simple answers . &quot;
P@@ ien@@ dorf : a Crus@@ her with helic@@ opter wanted
