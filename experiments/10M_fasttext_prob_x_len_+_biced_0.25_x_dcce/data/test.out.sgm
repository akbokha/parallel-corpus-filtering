<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - you want both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"unone, however, the two US presidential elections are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a principled, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep it small in doubt and warns how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regularities.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to increase the economy to death and regulate the world, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself would be quite different from that, maintains theTrump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively return regulations, and he makes for a wide-ranging tax reform with lower controls, for both private men and businesses."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has disadvantaged chances and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, the tax would increase for the rich, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the murders will be invested, Trump and Clinton almost wortate."</seg>
<seg id="14">Democratic Candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are strictly absent from the state-of the Republicans of Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"therefore, on Trump could therefore also come to party discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">"more, the differences in energy and climate policies are evident."</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power plants and re-run coal production in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil funding is also intended to be possible in so far protected areas to terminate the Paris climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton is aiming for further expanding the renewable energies with its investment programme:" "a country will create the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazifish trade agreement, do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both the United States do not want to isolate the USA from international trade, but just to better protect the American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"that should then be paid better then, calls for about Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger strike.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it on 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to be, then he says he should not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics say to him, so that the budget deficit would be even bigger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton is standing at least by the rich, that they pay more taxes and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="25">"in their home country they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honesty or forced prostitution."</seg>

<seg id="28">"that tugs for instance call for a bottle of water a sexual act is not a rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>

<seg id="30">"who believe that the end, as soon as they anchor in Germany, irre, told Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"even here, all women in Refugees would often be considered a minderous and worse."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to that about 90 percent of women living in the Muchner North, who are traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children have certainly not come up voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so unusual for they say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't want to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often do not have to help, needles more accommodations only for them, calls for baking."</seg>
<seg id="37">The seven districts of Bavaria are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question whether from a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction, we answer some with no."</seg>

<seg id="40">"even in Schwaben, women are not separated alone, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, Pressesprecher of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Oberbayern, Unter- and Mittelfranken there are some common shelters or homes only for single women and their children."</seg>

<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>

<seg id="8">I could no longer count.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but can even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on the next day one newspaper, that Erdogan would have heard so would never be some worst."</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite to indicate.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin radiant, sustainable cooling, that the state of Russia had nothing to forget."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his introductions: the sealing of a Russian fighter plane at the border of Turkey by Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was wutentburned.</seg>

<seg id="16">"this was even bigger, because it was committed by a supposed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">Vetrust rebuild it becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"months long, the state-controlled media led a fierce, unlimited attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks would like to blame for all the blame.</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the most serious officials, the allegations of senior officials, that Erdogan's family has benefited from the illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, which has been controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it is time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin was killed by the President Erdogan, which he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the benefits of an ceasefire are clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan takes first and foremost all the friends who can get it after the last month after a failed coup d'i almost his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repetitive terrorist attacks in Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is reduced by nearly 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, travel agent and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>

<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulate it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry in the West as the reaction to the tried to consider a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the persistent Groll come about the snail-accession negotiations and Putin - the piping to it from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the west."</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian state of State in Ankara won a bonus that he tried and asked for the elected government bodies in Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is well kept for Moscow, a matter of course, which itself has a profound fear of regimearies."</seg>
<seg id="41">"meeting in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, one, as it once would be an analysts once described," "Alliance of foreign executives," "two countries participating in the West and now feel bad."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently been supporting the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey opposing views."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant, that after nearly three hours of initial discussions, both Presidents told the press conference, that they could not even shed the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey avoided it intentionally to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus that can be found in Syria where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a complete dispaster, as NATO member of Turkey repealed the Russian fighter jet, it is certainly better that the two heads of state will talk at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivanov has asked to leave his post and have recommended Vaino as its successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">To convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putin's and works like he for the Soviet secret service that KGB.</seg>

<seg id="22">"in his remarks on Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said," "Ivanov" "is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - complained post four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"previously, he was Deputy Minister-Minister and Defense."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin's former member of State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Council (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin called his power, he called Ivanov as one of five people, he most familiar."</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was believed that Ivanov could become president of Russia as a third term of Putin's opposition against the Constitution.</seg>

<seg id="12">"in total, nearly 79% of the total bridgears are in their place and the last section of Decks gets today in Rosyth a bed for the deck, which means the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place."</seg>

<seg id="4">"the SPD proposes a" "action concept". ""</seg>
<seg id="5">Yet arguments is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all about the question: who should build the favorable apartments actually?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is lacking so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"CEO Christoph Bratmann says:" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas in future, must prove 20 percent of all the apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be developed in the stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the big force point in the city hall is, however, as Bratmann:" how do you want investors to build on private areas? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors in such areas at least 10 percent, but as 20 percent of the apartments build as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban residential construction program, which will cost millions of costs and will still be financed to provide incentives for incentives."</seg>

<seg id="15">The left does not want to keep roughness for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"regardless of this, Bratmann, baht is a tightening of the situation on the residence market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"when the concept of action is implemented, it will ensure additional tasks in the construction management."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the specialists.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but still the program is not entirely: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how do you compare the loss of other approximately 1300 apartments, whose promotion will run out in the coming years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, it will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, the planatory-policy speaker of Nicole Palm, should now be purchased at the current Bindings from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought to get back again into the price connection."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the west city.</seg>
<seg id="26">One fell swoop to solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">"for in the West city, the end of the year is run out."</seg>
<seg id="28">About 1800 apartments you could get there back to the prices for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: we do not want the owners, the housing companies. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"for example, the number of social housing in the west city has dramatically increasing, be removed from the goal of the so-called diarrhea."</seg>
<seg id="31">"there should be a concentration of social weak in only a few city districts, there should be no more."</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens anticipates that there will be even movement in the discussion.</seg>

<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here."</seg>

<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>

<seg id="2">Longlary men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you go to the commentary box, to confuse it under the pseudonym non-infection men with rough siblings, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the volatifying glass of record of sound-insulation does not want to welcome a boom in millennials that would like to welcome the rebirth of physical objects but to midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"those who have recently purchased a record, are all predictions according to the age between 45 and 54."</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most likely cheek-group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobbyists - it has an emotional meaning: older turntables retain their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a messenger report on TV, I would follow the camera, while in the middle of a busy road in Soho walk, a humble pull-suit and wildly soothing, before I keep away, keep my hands and keep a certain determinant as:" "so, let us take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let us take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Sohos is slowly coming to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic turntables."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera to the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I by Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle ages) into Reckless Records (number of number: eight men middle ages, a woman, probably around 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess already," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these silken, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed by him), dress the walls of his room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he possesses such considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: it is now able to buy records when they appeared and again buy objects which he sold, when he was young and bankrupt."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are out of the late sixties, early 70s, who appeared, when I was 11 or 12. things, where I probably was something too young to buy them," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees to those who are buying plates, rather introverted and like to spend time, and adds:" "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much."</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my aster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works by Sister Ray, believes also that many customers who meets the Yougv profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he has also noticed a new wave of people who have heard from the media, people who have heard about the comeback, and let themselves be able to buy their old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from talks that I have led, people usually have been kidnapped in 1998 or in 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who sold their records sold to buy CDs, sell now their CDs to get back to buy their records," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of the record highvals of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">"it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica, to realize that record stores a soothing community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older clients participated in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record-fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar soundproofs, of objects, the happier Jugenderings."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the feeding of a void or possession of the possessions as a kind of consolation," says WEZ. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is with me as collectors so I think it is with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social worker!" soldered a staff of a record-stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of ICM in April revealing that almost 50% of the people have bought a record, they have not yet heard."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% have a record player, which they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, no record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the report, I would probably look very concerned, while I was petalled by a stack of Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works with Sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle ages), has noticed a" Trophäenaspekt "of Revivals."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came only here and said," I have no record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead record, so that I can put them into the shelf "," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a great percentage, but it is definitely occurring."</seg>
<seg id="41">More produktlasous, less music-sided. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," "I have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones who are slowly getting started."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has devoted the soundtrack to almost a whole floor, has a bn audience than I call."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, Teenagejungs and women aged aged."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the standing-standing shops - wild Beasts synthesizer, and sextpacked Pop instead of experimental jazz, it is good to see such a diversity among customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them sees sonderous lonely, but nagging psychological traumas are difficult to be fixed when one stands next to someone 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs around in the shop for a few minutes and looked at the variation of the dotted plates."</seg>
<seg id="49">It more makes a mantal mortal body than a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, so the collecting of records is not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to hear music from one computer or other way, but the beauty of plates is..." they drives with a dearest sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a business, by which is said that a new generation of records have been inspired: urban outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I would like to posture the jeans hotpants, I observe a group of young teenagers that will be grouped for a moment to buy Polaroid cameras before a father and daughter to think about a crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody sees it - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"there is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, also the one that is most for luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my repentations take note that the results of Yougv vote, they leave at least in record stores in Soho, the great number of female collectors and records, who exist in reality, record stores and in online research."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning and certainly not with the leg through record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they steamed the rigid view of an unheimring, 30-year-old presenter, who hunted down over the shoulders of the middle ages."</seg>

<seg id="5">"news-related information obtained from high-level CentCom Commandeuren typically, a posititious picture of American efforts against terrorism would have been permitted and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services," quoted a newspaper article. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering when bad analyses of our political leaders presented," Ken Calvert, Republicans Member of the House of Representatives. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership errors in the CentCom are up to the top tip of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-sided report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi Armed Forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence that government heads have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts looked at the pressure from their previous laws, an optimal picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half-year 2015 many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements made before Congress clearly more positive than it corresponds to the facts."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom Anders announced publicly that a military reconquest of Mossloth had already started in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mossul, second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>

<seg id="16">"the report released on Thursday, will be completed by more detail insights, while the investigation will be continued."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of CentCom reports are due to the general inspecter of the Ministry of Defense in progress."</seg>
<seg id="18">"democratic members of the Newsletter, published on Thursday its own findings, which coincide with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015 the CentCom was created an overly restricted process for the creation of post-service estimates regarding ISIL and the Iraqi security services," given the most valuable democrat in the Committee for Adam B. Ship, in an opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, so Mr. Ship," "consumed the publication of news reports," "dismissed the morality of analysts and" there was a little room for deviating opinions. "</seg>
<seg id="21">Mr. Ship and Democrats went to have found no evidence on an intervention of the White House at the CentCom Analyst as regards a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".</seg>

<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the present reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>

<seg id="2">"a day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 winner over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American tennis-hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americaners with 3-0 won."</seg>
<seg id="3">"five gates in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said, they could not remember that ever done."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." "she said."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not among the people who kept their doors in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, it knows however: the Americaners are at 4-0 in the olympic competition, and are equal in their group with the Britinside on the first place that remains unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan."</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will face up on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarter-final, the game will decide which both within its group consisting of six teams in each of the first and second place."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first-placed will go a little bit longer out of the way that lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game may go on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprise-story by their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time spent three years with a Hockeyschläger in hands (their two older sisters also played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became the leader in the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympiad in 2008 as she could not qualify for the Kader.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the year 2012 came in which for her and her team did everything.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the darkening year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, Trainer of the National Team, and thus the things began to turn to better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the working order in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have rocked the rod completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">"on Thursday night, Bim opened the doorway in the first half of the game with a withdrawal from the seam."</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed herself surprisingly strong and kept the player from 1-0 to the third quarter, until they took their hands in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she finished a sprint with the flat ball over the left side, then moved into the middle and lupted the ball into the gate to obtain a 2-0 guide."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the keepers of the United States, Jackie Briggs that previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position" said Parnham, but how well will depend on Saturday the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="4">"it is as if the olympic torch itself is a burning stab, which is passed from the wristwatch for swimmers to the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can not switch off the TV to read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbours in the queue in the coffeshop, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman warm with graces, could possibly be among those known names, built up to the Prime Time, built through sponsors and well-empathy if he would be a swimmer, Turner or even Freal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the olympic trampoline for gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame is not lit up any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally recognized: air conditioning, Archery, Badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the flippers and may be there for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I is likely to make arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>

<seg id="14">This could be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to competition, there has never been a medal in the trampoline and had made a athlete until 2012 it has made up to the final."</seg>

<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Roher MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>

<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never to end up - but also the Grazie of the turnaround and doves that combines two sports that are essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" springboard. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia have risen to violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that zig-protectors were killed during the clashes with the police with the case.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to break up?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the past ten years, it was one of the stable countries of Africa, a solid state of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But over the last few months the protests against the government has deteriorated in ever more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people on the streets and required fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was almerciful according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave witnesses that policemen were shot on zig-armed protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the enveloping videos about protests, which are presumably hit by the last or beginning of this year, how security people are hit with sticks, while these were forced to make a handle against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN Authority on Human Rights is now asking a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country and in the future it becomes even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians, to fight against terrorist attacks beyond the region, particularly in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"roads are generally quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even though Ethiopia has been anything but an example for democracy - human rights organisations have led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited, with dissidents effective for silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness."</seg>
<seg id="21">But this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options except protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="23">All the youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">"there are numerous complaints that cover all from the ground up to the stranglehold, with regard to the power of the ruling coalition."</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a long-called vote last year, the ruling party and its allies have received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, the tension along the border to Eritrea; a battle for this delicate, controversial line called on June hundreds of lives."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analyst fear that separatists, like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogades, which were more or less forced in recent years, turbulence the turbulence and again."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of being driven to the surface now exploding.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems innocuous: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with social media because cheap smartphones were always more frequent and the internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government does not lock access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially at protests, many people can still communicate via internet-Proxies that they stop."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians have said that they gathered so at protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for its branches, the Amharas, the Amharas, who come from the edics mainly Christian high seas, in politics and economy, while they have been the Oromos, many of which are living and live in flat land areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray which represent about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, in trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former leader leader, was until his death on a non-publiciated disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was seen as tactic genius, a man who could think about the corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analysts are saying that he was particularly savvy in it, early signs of dissatisfaction and special appeal to use to process opponents and make them unharmful."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the present regime lacks at this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a confectionary analysis. "</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian New Prime Minister, Hailemariam desalegn, was chosen relatively unurly reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles. "</seg>
<seg id="47">"other than Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northwest, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analytic say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tigray-controlled safety services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time Ethiopia had been a turmoil for such a turmoil, after thousands of elections were protested by the government, according to the analyzer and then stolen from the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"while the following sweeps were killed many protesters, even if it were less than in the last months and these days of unrest was passed relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia guide to their visionary infrastructure planning, as the new pendent move, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intensification of the internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month's protesters in Gondar, an amharischen city, of Tigray guided shops and the hatred of the Tigray becomes more and more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analytic say that the protests supported by the US and other Western allies in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, although they recently wedge that she has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"in the West he clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want its allies in an already volatile area breaks."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this", "said Mr Abdi," "is a very thin Gratmigration."</seg>

<seg id="14">"at the end of July he moved strong criticism to him, when he said the Russians were Mrs. Clintons e-mails, but he explained later" Of course, I said the sarkastic. "</seg>

<seg id="17">But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>

<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Grönlandhaie usually come only in winter to surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board of the Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the Nordatlantics until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie received only 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Greenland shark at the bottom of the Nordatlantiks along the ground, in an hour it comes on average just 1.220 meters wide."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it arrives, the five meter long animal accelerates 2,6 km / h - and at this top speed is half as fast as a Robbe."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, this of long-term lifestyles seems to be a patent for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" Science "at any rate by a Greenland, the 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Schrolein by the Max Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this span, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"indeed, the evolution of evolution has long been staging."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only faults the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Grönland haie are hard to watch, eventually they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the skinny coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees centigrade, they usually dive on the surface only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">"about the lifestyle of the Grönland haie, researchers know little accordingly."</seg>
<seg id="17">Her time-up empiouted her when she had six animals sitting in front of one transmitter equipment.</seg>
<seg id="18">"loot make this sharks anyway: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a rub, another had the jaw of a young polar bears."</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they chase sleeping-sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the iron and search caaver made up of higher water layers for downstairs.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Grönland-haie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as an applause from the depth of the Nordatlantiks."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, analysing them with the carbon-14 method the lens of sharks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eyelid is already born in front of the birth of the sharks, which contained in it will no longer be redone."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly a lot of carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">"therefore, your birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s than nuclear weapons, as nuclear, try bigger amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the length of 220 centimetres the length of the smallest animal contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland-haie had a normal carbon-14 quantities in its lens with normal carbon-14 quantities that is created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-clock showed an age of 335 centimetres long lasting at the age of 335, during the record shark with 502 centimeters, even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Grönland females only got up until they are longer than four metres, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers of the length were assigned an age."</seg>
<seg id="31">"because one of the animals with 392 centimeters is probably on the cusp to the sexually mature and his age was determined with 156 years, Grönland with the multiplication is obviously at least one and a hundred centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">Even this is likely to be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in eisian waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"also the previous record-holder, a 211 year old Grönland, in whose bacon at Nacken to put up a 120 year old Hares, was caught in Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"thanks to the low temperatures, often the organism of the animals living there live on austerity."</seg>
<seg id="36">They thus mature later - and age slow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm water in cold water, the animals are also very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"the volume is growing much faster than its surface, through which the animal invaded heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a grams of mouse is therefore much bigger than with a grams of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal is therefore living more dangerous and should concentrate on as possible as many descendants as possible," explains the evolution of evolution. "</seg>

<seg id="19">"in Germany, many hospitals in Germany were victims of attack, whose patients may be threatened by loss of sick."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the sacrifices always: do not pay, you only promote the problem," says Kleczynski. "</seg>

<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know that and try to build a good reputation.</seg>

<seg id="25">"they explain their sacrifices by chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, direct accessible support sites or decode for example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and are a private businessman according to payments of a few hundred billion euros, businesses have to pay well and pay five-digit sums in order to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risk of profits from the ransomware blackmail, the hacker gets more and more professional and share the work, explains security expertewski from the Antivirus provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware approximately within one week.

<seg id="4">"after all, with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently unrelaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep?</seg>

<seg id="12">It is not rare that the insolation expression is an expression of another disease.</seg>

<seg id="17">When one should consult with sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who is not well cared for over a period of a month at least three nights per week and is not affected by the day, should go to the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment can look quite differently: one is beaten, tired, unripped, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has moods or physical symptoms such as stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to soothing the sleep, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>

<seg id="24">This can be clarified by examinations if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go into the dormitories, and what happens there?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"to investigate in the dormitory medicine, for example with snoring with respiratory tract, with sleeping-sensitive daily fatigue, or if you do not find the cause of a disjunk," "Fietze." "</seg>
<seg id="27">"in fact, one does not need to prepare for the study."</seg>

<seg id="6">"she sees itself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working-free refugees, administration, public authorities and who else is concerned."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Regine Client from the working circle indicates that the volunteer is more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the eagerly Wollishau which primarily has a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"so, some - less spottful as much as the multitude of tasks would be purposeful - meant, when the administration wanted to write the place."</seg>
<seg id="9">"was a administrative division with a talent for languages and people, connected with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just a progressive Wollishau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"most of all it is about organization, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network strength."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been around for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent position on three years of duration.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuschle honouring and full-full actors support. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are available at the washing-road</seg>
<seg id="17">"a serious problem has been found for some time, flats for connecting people who have been acknowledged."</seg>
<seg id="18">For the connection, the municipalities are responsible. "</seg>
<seg id="19">You must put refugees in their own or logged living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the cost of construction, rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the landratchas in the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search for some time has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto there is no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it does not work so you rely on private apartments, so dieule."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, the common apartments must be controlled as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so soon, new containers will soon be placed in the washing road."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, the Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed Bleibe, there are internship places, training courses, training courses, a euro-jobs and educational activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building or help domestic mastered, do charitable work - and this motivated and very neat, like Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive outlook.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no employment therapy". ""</seg>
<seg id="35">"occupation, but not only work."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day spent a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so do all offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So we also jump in management and volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are appreciated in Germany and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the trial is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"you must declare to the refugees that it just takes and they can repay the time useful, for example, with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who at some point the feeling is developing, he could not help in Urbach don't want to work and be unnütz, who will never be integrated."</seg>
<seg id="45">The marked majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but problem happens, however, says customer honest," people, where nothing is doing. "the work of deuces and customers are therefore always to motivate others too."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: have the two according to recent occurrences are afraid of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine Kunde says quite clearly, "what mancher naive call." a Restrisiko could and would not want it out. "</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitized are the assistant but already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also the subject of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They had the fear that the attacks bring them completely in call.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, main - and volunteer is to be held on site and in the region of activities."</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new Stoß could come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a ceiling?</seg>
<seg id="58">That question clearly to answer is the politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to place it helpers on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not yet arrived, where we would like to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, this would be able to relax."</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine customer also makes it clear that Urbacher have already dealt with, the previous people are reasonable."</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in distress, you need them to help them agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complex, because there is no simple answers."</seg>
