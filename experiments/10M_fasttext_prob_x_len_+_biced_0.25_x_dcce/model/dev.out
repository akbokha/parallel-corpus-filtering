Obama receiving Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
they wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement as well as to oppose Teheran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; during the meetings , it is also to take a conflict with the Palestinians and the argu@@ ed two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years .
Washington has critic@@ ised the ongoing sett@@ ling super@@ structure of Israel and Netanyahu k@@ thro@@ ws up the lack of peace in the peace process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by the Obama promoted deal with the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship of the two continues to deterior@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in March , Netanyahu has held a controversial decision on invitation of the Republi@@ cans in front of the U.S. Congress , which was considered to be part of an af@@ front against Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not speaking with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with an indication of the forthcoming election in Israel . &quot;
taking a call for his friend to have shot his friend
&quot; in an emergency , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on lived with a somewhat tre@@ ad voice of the police that he was shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
he &apos;s important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably excited and he said the family @-@ contacts the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
&quot; in the house we found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note , which was on a white block : &quot; &quot; I am doing it so , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved . this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that he has traveled in two online courses for the Delta State University in C@@ lev@@ eland , Mississippi , signed , already 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was killed and killed by the police in his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ cies Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that univers@@ ally employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he has done the fatal ble@@ aching at some point .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took up the life when the police touched him .
&quot; after a day after shooting at the University , the students and teachers are forced to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what he &apos;s Lamb . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators in both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw an image of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students say that they were fre@@ ed on their lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ites died , he did not have any history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
he himself was he mentioned in a book written by him where he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
&quot; they were both under the Department of Social Sciences and History , their teachers , 17 members , and many students visited classes of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some dis@@ appearing to problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on L@@ avers who said he also seemed a bit excited and nervous , as if something might be wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that lam@@ b told him that he had at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress . &quot;
he had previously asked the Delta State University to have asked for health reasons and said that he did any matter of health .
this year he set up only two online classes .
&quot; recent changes in the employment policy of the University are meant that the promotion has worked so hard for the Lamb , which he would have no guarantee for an automatic way to an employment as assistant professor . &quot;
&quot; Universal President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he wis@@ s nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was a little in Mr Lam@@ b@@ ulation . &quot;
they are questions that he can no longer answer .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police reached a lam@@ bs , when he returns from Ark@@ ansas . &quot;
&quot; before he was arrested , killed himself with an .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun at the back@@ yard of a house about a Mei@@ le south of his parents on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still running in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lam@@ b went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; he founded his work at the University , the 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants , and he set up geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he pro@@ mo@@ p in the spring of the ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friend@@ bs appointed him as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
Carla H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lam@@ b was 20 when they met through common friends .
&quot; she and her friends were at high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar lu@@ de . &quot;
he then was the woman s@@ warm .
&quot; all the girls was mel@@ ted that when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson suburbs of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and pr@@ enti@@ ces were obviously some time together .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I did my wife killed , &quot; &quot; but there was no chi@@ rop@@ athy of a marriage . &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick building that is adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were shot 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground , &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that he was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
he met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail did both during three years ago .
later they played together one way or another .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse responsible for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sh@@ af@@ fer , a bar@@ man and sometimes enter@@ tain@@ er Co@@ ordinator at The Jul@@ ep Room , a weak lighted yard close to Gau@@ tier , said that he &apos;s he &apos;s piano and Pr@@ enti@@ ss night ended up in the night 5th of September . he finished his guitar accordion and m@@ outh@@ ik@@ asp@@ ic ended in front of a sp@@ ook@@ y audience . &quot;
there was no sign that anything do not coinci@@ de .
&quot; simply just a happy pair , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the Au@@ fr@@ aming and cher@@ ishes with each other .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of joke . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the dead Professor , led the first time @-@ term seminar and specialised in American indigenous peoples and colonial story , Don Al@@ an Mitchell , a English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ansas and became President of his Br@@ otherhood and the students committee .

&quot; Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans throughout the report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to conf@@ lic@@ ting that the police said now , he won the emergency , and that he recorded in his assistant Pr@@ enti@@ ss indeed as his wife , but there is no indication of it that the two ever got married . &quot;

UN conductor says : there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General of K@@ i @-@ moon says , his response to Russian strengthened military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost 5 year lasting conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN CEO once again calls for all parties , including its shared UN Security Council to uni@@ fy and integr@@ ative negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; said to a press conference on Wednesday , he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member states of the Council - U.S. , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the Council of the Minist@@ erial meeting of the Assembly still during this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he de@@ plor@@ es that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation uns@@ ol@@ vable .
&quot; B@@ an also called for the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in cop@@ ing with the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated with Iran in achieving a nuclear programme . &quot;
&quot; 8 Um@@ br@@ ella , showing that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious . &quot;
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; however no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks at the surveys , it has ( still ) does not work . &quot;
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tru@@ mp in the two @-@ dig@@ it range and some begin to ask yourself what it means for opportunities to nom@@ ination the real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody asser@@ ted that Tru@@ mp would probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphas@@ ise that at that time , Rick &apos;s leadership has been given to the Asc@@ ent Herman C@@ ain in 2011 , of which not only a state won in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would fight in a general choice .
but outside groups such as J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super P@@ AC and the conservative business group Club for Growth recognize Tru@@ mp@@ s stamina and begin to exp@@ el their dollars in order to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a tran@@ sit@@ ory phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s Beli@@ ans@@ es have been turned around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans showed the real estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l . &quot;
until the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
&quot; now , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive opinion of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
about three out of ten tell them that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures remain in the early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa made last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of Republi@@ can , they were either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tru@@ mp would have been nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say , they were &quot; angry &quot; when he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm like Tru@@ mp ( 43 per cent , they were &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent , which say the same about Tru@@ mp ) . &quot;
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters want them &quot; dis@@ cont@@ ented , &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Republi@@ cans sees Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and bel@@ ated statements , 52 percent of the Irish republi@@ cans and Irish voters want the real temper@@ ament to a president , says ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number applies in the first court state of the nation , the state of Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a com@@ mander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he didn &apos;t have the personality to effectively perform his job , and almost six of 10 Independent State say that his temper@@ ament was not in the White House of p@@ asse , says ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; if they put up their terrain , republi@@ can voters maintain the Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked , who in the shortest the GO@@ P nom@@ ination gains , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from the past week four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the date when four of ten end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P @-@ voters in the past did not have the clear@@ est cryst@@ all@@ ball .
&quot; at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ cans agreed that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
nevertheless it shows that a large number of GO@@ P @-@ voters can see addressing the trust@@ s campaign as a plau@@ sible .
&quot; even when the republi@@ cans were gathered around a different candidate , Tru@@ mp be@@ ys still almost everybody . &quot;
some experts suggest that the split field is likely to contribute to Tru@@ mp@@ s leadership while the Anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed on more than a dozen other candidates .
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University at the beginning of September indicates that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he has above Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Y@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before border Paul , John Ka@@ ins and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ hau@@ l the business with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp @-@ fans said that they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new pol@@ l conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Tru@@ mp , say they have fixed their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , things can happen to change this and nobody can truly say , never change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said they let the door open to change to other candidates .
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s is strongest competition in the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , neuro@@ surgeon , Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have made their minds are twice as common for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six of 10 Republi@@ cans say it was coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp in the subject of immigration .
&quot; since then , Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign launched two months ago from Mexico &quot; Rap@@ ist &quot; , &quot; was the immigration and fishing point in public discourse . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expression of Tru@@ mp is crucial H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ Americans from the Republi@@ can party and will damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / post survey , from Monday they say six of 10 Republi@@ cans corresponding with Tru@@ mp in matters of immigration . &quot;
&quot; as long as immigration remains in the lim@@ elight , it will be done by Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s on new high@@ s .
&quot; by Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all through their out@@ sider status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Monday @-@ day survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey of D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in Io@@ wa at two weeks ago shows that three of four Io@@ wa @-@ Republi@@ cans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress with 54 percent &quot; unhappy and 21 percent . &quot;

&quot; but the Bavaria , in seven Europe @-@ up Du@@ elles with the Greek team did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ ageous , but in their evident efforts but often to be cat@@ ching . &quot;
the attacks have been led to frequently per player shift on Link@@ sau@@ ces Douglas Costa and is rarely crossed out against the former Br@@ uns@@ wick Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .

&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , so that not only of the lungs , but also the teeth - this lies a central @-@ long @-@ term study . &quot;
good news : when rel@@ ying the risk sin@@ ks fast .
smokers have a significantly increased risk to lose their teeth .
&quot; this is due to the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ F ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smoking , smoking was the risk to lose their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely in order to get the 2,5 up to 3,@@ 6 times higher . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 people . &quot;
&quot; leading cause of tooth loss are car@@ ies and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ va , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ fine . &quot;
for these Par@@ o@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor that emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and dental loss therefore go back to frequent g@@ ums for smokers .
not clear either to what extent smoking is also the risk of car@@ ies .
&quot; people who hear@@ ken@@ ed to smoking could reduce their risk however in a short time , the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years , until the haz@@ ard returned to the level of non @-@ divers , the author explained by Thomas Diet@@ rich , from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; man must convince humans of it , non @-@ smoking , &quot; &quot; leader H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; smoking short@@ ens the life time . &quot;
not to smoke is good for lung and vessels and leads to our findings even a good dental health to the high age .
&quot; in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population is affected by the age of 65 to 74 years of la@@ wl@@ essness , distributed TH@@ AT . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking is the risk for early dental loss .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute
&quot; to raise the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement , TTIP has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the disp@@ uted private banking institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be dis@@ band@@ ed by a more transparent system , which in its function appears much more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want a system to set up the citizens &quot; , &quot; the EU Commissioner nomin@@ ee Cecilia Malm@@ ström before the launch . &quot;

most of the arbit@@ ration of the arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) were regarded as one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against the TTIP .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Chief of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns is expected to provide the Prime Minister with tension on the issue of the Prime Minister .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is to provide the Prime Minister during the issues of the Prime Minister and for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to place the first of its six out@@ dated questions just after lunch and its performance from the media is probably under review .
he called for &quot; less theat@@ res and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he has also said that he could ski@@ p some meetings to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ no leadership , for it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow rap@@ ist and following his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the decision of the Labour Party , on Tuesday during the Sin@@ gets of the National hy@@ m@@ n had prov@@ oked a commemor@@ ative ceremony of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ised a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and at the center@@ piece of several Tit@@ le @-@ stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ no &apos;s decision , not to sing the national hy@@ m@@ n , has attracted attention to itself &quot;
&quot; a narr@@ ator by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said , he would have been &quot; &quot; respectful quiet &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in Air@@ line around England &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ no Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night programme , he told the Labour leaders to sing the national hy@@ m@@ n , &quot; independently &quot; by his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns top team and they refer to differences in business , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary Party gave it a leader to its leader . &quot;
&quot; the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences arise among the Labour &quot; &quot; st@@ acking &quot; &quot; and by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns declaration on the position of the European Union and the limit of profitability . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour will make changes in order to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of a shadow and ru@@ ary Minister , that the Party was &quot; very clear &quot; that they only had against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26.@@ 000 £ to 23,@@ 000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour chair that David Cameron , since he &apos;s T@@ ory chief is over the D@@ isp@@ atch box in the Parliament over the last decade . &quot;
&quot; the Labour chair , promised to a different policy approach , says that &quot; &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for questions about Mr Cameron and given him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the questions of the Prime Minister is to con@@ front@@ ational and that he will refrain from condem@@ nation &quot; and fighting with resistance and instead , focusing on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said Angela Eagle that is represented by the shadows of an economic minister when he is not participating - for example if Mr Cameron is on the way of his travels .
&quot; he also brought the idea to conversation that other colleagues occasionally seize the word and that John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House of House , said to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; said Mr Cameron , Mr Cameron wants to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ Theatre &quot; &quot; who often was mer@@ ged with the issues of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he sp@@ rang that he was failing . &quot;
&quot; she was sent on TV first in 1990 on TV , became the issue with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer for the leader of a leader and his leadership among his parliamentary elections , although critics argue over a caric@@ ature and thanks so far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A @-@ poster brings Leb@@ anese on potato

&quot; it goes both -- and indeed in the potato har@@ ems , who developed the Ol@@ den@@ burger land@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the Sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; Pot@@ ato , instead of don@@ er &quot; on a poster the PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A movement has put together Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat together on a phi@@ list@@ ine . &quot;
the idea brought him a poster in a PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the heading &quot; potatoes instead of don@@ er &quot; which he acci@@ dentally had seen on TV .
&quot; since then , in his shop , a barbecue , which is sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is multic@@ ultur@@ al for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
the idea of the Leb@@ an@@ ean now has become a pat@@ ent@@ age in Munich in the meantime .
here it has been protected according to information the authority and has been protected as a second pattern .
&quot; as much meat and how much potatoes of the put@@ ty includes , Al@@ h@@ ay wants not to bet@@ ray it . &quot;
&quot; only as much : &quot; &quot; it tastes even better &quot; , &quot; he finds . &quot;

Met@@ cash starts ground @-@ commercial campaign to combat al@@ di@@ ence
Met@@ als tried to protect the Ig@@ A branch in front of a Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ alers Met@@ ric has started an ground @-@ like campaign to defend the market share of the Ig@@ A ret@@ ailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of an 700 million of the Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di opens the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , reinforce met@@ cash and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarkets to build their relations with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A through mainstre@@ am @-@ marketing and marketing on social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A @-@ ret@@ ailer and suppliers jump on board with brands such as ice @-@ manufacturer S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ borough that distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ Shops and shop@@ ke@@ epers , the discounted tickets for the South Australian C@@ liga to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash further details on its defence strategy on 29 September when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices are performing its annual investors strategy . &quot;
it stands much at the game because South Australia and Western Australia nearly 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ shop@@ plates produce and larger profit mar@@ gins as a Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ Network in the East states .
&quot; both purchases in South Australia and Western Australia include a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison to around 14 per cent into the East states . &quot;
&quot; however , an@@ al@@ ysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di twelve months after opening its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states will be swe@@ pt away and all existing actors , but mainly take independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath won by Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Ig@@ A @-@ ret@@ ailer 360 million sales per year and Met@@ cash 250 million will lose $ million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this progn@@ osis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened 25 stores in SA in the next year and 30 in WA , and a turnover of € 500 million and $ 600 million in each market . &quot;
&quot; the loss of food and gro@@ cer@@ ies and with the amounts to Met@@ cas@@ hs , high fixed cost can cost met@@ cash around 13 million $ earnings before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time Met@@ cash market shares loses in the east states , mainly in Al@@ di and CO@@ LES , although a recent survey of Roy Morgan discovered that Ig@@ A @-@ Pur@@ tist got the most fi@@ del@@ ity . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley takes up that met@@ a &apos;s sales in food and gro@@ cer@@ ies by 3.8 percent in 2017 and 2.8 percent in 2018 will fall in 2018 and will reduce market share by 14 percent in 2015 to 10,@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading Fond@@ ation Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , during a business dinner in Melbourne , that met@@ ros would probably disappear inside a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear . &quot;
Met@@ cash borro@@ wed it to respond publicly on the comments from Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a member of met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass last week has made contact .
&quot; IG@@ As &apos;s market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 per cent , and revenue from Met@@ cas@@ h@@ ort and food trade , which provides about 1,@@ 200 by Ig@@ A @-@ ret@@ ailer , which is reflected in 2012 by 43 percent , which reflects the operating minimum pressure on turnover and mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler shield themselves and invested more than $ 150 million , sales prices with CO@@ LES and Wo@@ ol@@ lik@@ ens during improving their stores each week through faster growing fresh food , and having a better choice of private @-@ label food products . &quot;
&quot; the main business leaders Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price comp@@ asses and shop refurb@@ ishment programme to be upgraded and hopes that the wholes@@ aler in the year 2017 will return to prize growth for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis is supported by the President of the Australian tennis Association Steve Heal@@ y
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis deserves more praise as a cri@@ tic to his behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve Heal@@ y rather praise as criticism for his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the younger of talented Du@@ os that is always called &quot; &quot; Special K@@ s &quot; , &quot; performed by the in@@ famous confrontation of K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os with the St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ inka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ da and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison must be separated twice through the refer@@ ee , whereby Har@@ rison did not have to hit K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os , and I should hit the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et , after a cr@@ amp@@ f a potential US Open @-@ win was defended by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ da was endor@@ sed by Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the teen is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in an individual behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup finals against the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing , about which I became a kind , is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little in the dispute . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he has broken one sm@@ ack@@ et , when he lost because of a cr@@ amp@@ er in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has bre@@ ached out of fro@@ st with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of that . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has led himself in the US Open was extremely well , even among the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around you , and I believe it was a little bit extended . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained in shape , he is well in shape , he is a very stur@@ dy and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged on his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; Heal@@ y also supported the decision to counter K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os in the important decision @-@ decision , which starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as long @-@ term integral part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely concentrated on competition and not on all the contro@@ versy &#91; K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; &quot; Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; and I believe that Nick was done very fast to Ascension , and he has made some bad mistake , and deserves all the critics what he gets , but we try to think him . some time outside of the lim@@ elight , in which it can only think that I consider adequate , and it is best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;
Europe refugee crisis : Hungary explains Emer@@ gency closes the border and keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency and put the border line with Serbia on Tuesday and held all firm that tried to go illegal into the country . everything with the goal to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
&quot; chaos followed at the border , as hundreds of migrants recorded in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , and Serbian officials led to rebellion . &quot;
people who were flying against violence and had st@@ ained for an unknown period of time at the road between the two check@@ points of the countries and built tents and settled down there .
but fru@@ stration went on .
&quot; as a police helic@@ opter over them ho@@ vering , &quot; &quot; andi@@ bor@@ ed the migrants &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; and scre@@ amed out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot;
some were transferred from protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister is &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants would be returned from Hungary during more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damages .
&quot; in the coming days talks with Brussels and other countries , I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot;
the tur@@ mo@@ il in the Hungarian @-@ Ser@@ b border came to an open immigration policy one day after the 28 @-@ nations @-@ blo@@ c meeting in Brussels .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were in over@@ wrapped Italy and Greece refu@@ ge . they oppressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would have agreed that EU @-@ states would include more 120@@ .000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday to discuss a special summit of the European Union in order to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
but Hungary did not establish his hopes for an intensive promotion of Brussels or from its neighbours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency meeting in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to get out of the crisis , so they could over@@ see roads and asylum . &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan the construction of a sp@@ lin@@ t @-@ wir@@ ls along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after it has ended a fence on the Ser@@ b border .
&quot; C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even the prison guards , in the competition , the bar@@ bed wire @-@ wire between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months Hungary for many war migrants in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East has become a significant strategic pass , and has become a gateway to the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insi@@ sted that most people are fle@@ eting for a better life and not for war migrants who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws which occurred at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence , which led the government along the southern edge to Serbia , to a crime . these laws do also place higher arrest warran@@ t for condemned human dealers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation that the mass has emerged through the mass migration , the Hungarian government tells the emergency , &quot; said delegates of Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs por@@ ters in the southern City of Sz@@ eged . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree with the use of military personnel , which is expected for next week , but re@@ por@@ ter from Associ@@ ated Press have already been at the border difficult to armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security consultant for Or@@ ban , told that authorities 45 people trying to cross the border to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across as to damage the fence , they are now in a police force and are accused of crimes of criminal off@@ ences in accordance with the new laws . &quot;
authorities are going to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; Hungarian officials concluded that there were two of the seven border crossing with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire , in order to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos envel@@ ops the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container , in order to process the data of men and pressing a crowd , to push themselves down . &quot;
&quot; approximately 20 succeeded to come down , but thousands were staying outside . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a further group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection from Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary . &quot;
election in 2016 : Hill@@ ary clust@@ ered prot@@ ru@@ sion before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ bi@@ ert
&quot; the former Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continue to keep a two @-@ dig@@ it lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at the national level , but sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie is gaining ground on ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second in the second place , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice @-@ Chairman Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced , whether he candidate for the presidential system , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months prior to the elections , tell the majority of democratic voters that it is too early to say that their opinion is fixed to what candidates they will support . &quot;
but Cl@@ int@@ ons supporters are more pre@@ valent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders had some profits . &quot;
Clinton holds a big jump in both women and moder@@ ates but these proj@@ ections have reduced .
&quot; your support in the men has significantly dropped , and it is different here only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; cl@@ int@@ ons advantage of democratic constitu@@ ents under 50 years has deterior@@ ated , and they and s@@ anders are now on the same height . &quot;
Clinton had a big advantage with the older voters .
last month Clinton had been front of a double @-@ dig@@ al advantage with a double @-@ dig@@ it lead in the liber@@ als but now S@@ anders has a 5 point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the presidential elections can say enough to support Clinton if they were nominated by the Party .
&quot; a quarter would support them with some advantages , and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the nomin@@ ee . &quot;
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Cl@@ int@@ ons are current supporters especially from her .
the views are stronger at those who currently not support Clinton - only about one quarter would support them .
&quot; during 48 percent of the democratic voters of the presidential elections , they finally support Clinton to tell less Republi@@ can voters have about their peak @-@ run @-@ run by Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Cl@@ int@@ ec facilit@@ ates in an open question why they want them to be the nomin@@ ee , the most common response has ( 16 percent ) , followed by that it is time that a woman president is president ( 13 percent ) and that they are the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; by Cl@@ int@@ ons , her connection with Bill Clinton is also mentioned as Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) . &quot;
consent to dealing with problems and voters are c@@ ited .
&quot; as the Vice President e@@ jects a potential for the presidential system into the scale , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the presidential election shall see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked by the election , who would be the second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the hel@@ m . &quot;
&quot; from Cl@@ int@@ ons followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would have their second choice far in front of him .
&quot; decides Bi@@ den , not to indicate the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Cl@@ int@@ eg@@ s increases before S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in competition on 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win the election ; however , this number of 78 percent came in the last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measuring , but the percentage of who sees him as the &quot; &quot; chosen &quot; &quot; has increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , with the question of what is more important with a candidate call democr@@ acies up to voters . &quot;
&quot; similar to last month , there is no single candidate to candidate or potential candidate for these voters of pres@@ election as unacceptable . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic candidates , or potential candidates show good results in some key characteristics of the voters of their party elections . &quot;
&quot; maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong guides . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den cuts the top three candidates most from honest@@ y , while Cl@@ int@@ ons star@@ ters the leadership . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) but 27 percent do not have any opinion on him . &quot;
democratic voters of pres@@ election in general also Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
a quarter of the Democratic voters did not think of any kind in all these measurements .
&quot; as questions about Hill@@ ary Cl@@ intact use of a personal email address and a server continued during the term as an out@@ ward minister , most of the Democratic voters of the pre@@ election are satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public .
&quot; half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their Declaration , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion about this was in March , shortly after the problem coming to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans say that the e @-@ mail contro@@ versy had no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion has still deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly Republi@@ cans , over 6 of 10 which say their views of Clinton have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded as honest and trust@@ worthy of the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , it will continue to be seen as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight per cent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of voting rights do not retain it for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of the vote @-@ power nation@@ als also see Tru@@ mp as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp are also received good notes on leadership .
&quot; by the six tested candidates cutting with Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush on the best in honest@@ y . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders , as honest , but as at Car@@ son many do not have any opinion of him . &quot;
the fault rate for the sample of the 351 constitu@@ ents at the pres@@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son re@@ moves near the survey behind Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is located at the latest survey on C@@ BS News / New York Times and behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; by the two candidates , half of the support they dis@@ closes in the new pol@@ l , and others are losing dramatic . &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in great numbers . the support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted before the Fox news debate last month to 27 % in survey from Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son sm@@ ug@@ oss 6 % in the same period of 6 % .
the survey also y@@ iel@@ ded that Car@@ son arrives in demo@@ graphic groups well and strongly contrac@@ ted by Tru@@ mp on Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , except for Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ itself , has fallen in his deepest affairs with Wis@@ la Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , which is most meaningful and from 10 % support in the last month of now 2 % . &quot;
the former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush ; the former Gover@@ nor of Ark@@ ansas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located at 6 % on the third place .
the bug@@ ging of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son climb@@ s in the surveys - he all@@ ot@@ ted with 19 % support among the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed insul@@ ts clearly before Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view of one in the last week on rising Car@@ son , Tru@@ mp found some side procedures for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after car@@ son dos@@ ed for it , Tru@@ mp@@ s belief in question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp on last Saturday during a stop show in Io@@ wa . &quot;
pleasant bathing @-@ temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean Sea is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if top values are measured only in the distance , there is already a trip to the Mediterranean to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in North@@ or Baltic is likely to be a bit of 17 degrees at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; there is no more to the sea at a maximum of 18 degrees , the water in the north and the Baltic Sea , this week , shares the Deutsche Wetter@@ dienst ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; water @-@ temperatures still offers the Mediterranean sea : in the East , it even comes up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , there are 25 degrees in the Adriatic in France . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Br@@ otherhood has deb@@ ited with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ new@@ com@@ er
&quot; almost two years after a student during a hi@@ bos@@ h@@ ous ceremonies entered into Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , will be filed for complaint against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of New York &apos;s Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ otherhood gained from Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory period in September 2013 and consumed its transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death divided into the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said that he has been loaded with connected eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly , while he tried to go over a frozen field on a target . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g ch@@ ored finally about head@@ aches , then he fell before . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ otherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g is power@@ less and supposedly did an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; but they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to send his symptoms of goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Br@@ otherhood , in order to get advice , said Pol@@ tics Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at that point the members began to hide and put the well @-@ being of the Br@@ otherhood , in principle above the Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Pol@@ and@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not revi@@ ved , and he died next morning to his injury . &quot;
&quot; after a car @-@ screen , Den@@ g is repeated with st@@ ump@@ y force injury to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the chic@@ ks of the Br@@ otherhood . at least a student dies since 1970 every year at the chic@@ ks , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s Family represents , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accountable , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended the indic@@ t@@ ment for the first five members .
&quot; forty @-@ two members of the Br@@ otherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged for schi@@ z@@ ous attacks and formation of a criminal union . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to take charge of the people involved ; but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ official - this , we will also hold them to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College is forbidden for the Br@@ otherhood , and the national Br@@ otherhood has re@@ vo@@ ke its affili@@ ation to the village group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed raises interest rates
&quot; a fork @-@ height comes , and the se will come into conflict , will return for bonds , and the economy will shine in a recession . &quot;
this is what we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy is only a small step forward . &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted 86 months .
&quot; aggression of the Federal Reserve on raising the interest rates is often , though not always , a factor here , as the economy and the financial investment . &quot;
&quot; hence , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have repeatedly stressed that investors should not concentrate on raising interest rates , but rather for the time period that is required for norm@@ alization . &quot;
in fact several variables play a role .
in the end market participants could find that the whole excitement was exagger@@ ated because of a fork @-@ height .
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inev@@ itably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of the &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Apostle at Capital Economics , in a communication of customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of the U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level , to the@@ atri@@ cal shock that seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a look at the historic trends @-@ based view on how some areas of business might react :
&quot; as the market has seen in the last month , the notification of interest rate can make things for a while vol@@ ati@@ l . &quot;
&quot; once increasing , the influence is not that dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there appears to be a tendency to be diver@@ ted from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche @-@ Bank Analy@@ st in a newer study , what happens after interest rates of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market has been growing mostly during the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to fork altitude , fairly flat in the past six years , with average return in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with average return in Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s asset management . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on shares may rise later in the increasing cycle and returns the return to decre@@ asing .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic activity but Zin@@ tia exercises they often support .
&quot; in the current case the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions , which did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;
&quot; very notable is that the gross domestic product is in the vicinity of its lowest point , in a fork @-@ height of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , there was only 4.5 percent nominal GDP since 1950 alone . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3,@@ 6 percent , only a few expects that this will last and expect only 1,5 percent in the third quarter . &quot;
&quot; zinc in@@ ca@@ vities at a so fragile economic setting might be ris@@ ky and throw the question if it is different this time , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; participants have taken all year round a fork extension of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many roads and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trading is only a 25 percent probability . &quot;
&quot; in our study all the roll@@ out cycles from 1950 to today in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ers are very fast following the beginning of recovery in the shadows &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest serving the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these have been 74 months . &quot;
&quot; the firm income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , since the market represents a fork extension , and the pattern is pretty similar to the capital market . &quot;
&quot; the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than at shares , when they change their strategic course . &quot;
&quot; at bonds , the result appear to shift the direction as soon as the first increase / reduction in the cycle is done . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the cycle of the increases cycle , the employees are immediately affected , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ at@@ egen of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in the interest rates will bring , that they bring more closer ties between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ ail of the curve . &quot;
&quot; bor@@ ehol@@ es often bring better y@@ ields in such a climate although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher y@@ ields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting , says Jones , that the markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed strategy . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted itself to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates well , the yield strength is increased , loans have increased and the vol@@ ati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market , when the F@@ ed has intensified their strategy . &quot;
&quot; over the large and whole companies , developing the larger portion of their operations in the United States , benefit if interest rates are rising and local products are more attractive . &quot;
&quot; any multination@@ als with high debts will be worse , as an increasing amount of dollars is making their products on the global market as an increasing amount of debt as well as the financing of its debts . &quot;
&quot; the story indicates that &quot; quality - &quot; shares tend to react very positively , three months after an initial demonstration of interests , &quot; said gold@@ man Sach@@ s an@@ al@@ ysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded corporations in the balance sheet after each of the interests in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 on average of 5 percentage points . &quot;
&quot; companies with high capital yield and lower vol@@ ati@@ lity with their stocks , also pun@@ ish their counter@@ parts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) . &quot;
debt is a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates are most losing ; Gold@@ man said .
&quot; outside the pure stock , consumers will also benefit from the increasing dollar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Spar@@ ks could see profits from higher income , even if experts from different opinions are , how quickly that will take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Spe@@ aker Andrew B@@ ingham
the conserv@@ atives of the Parliament criti@@ ci@@ zed the channel for his &quot; distor@@ tion &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is not distingu@@ is@@ hable from commercial ri@@ vals .
&quot; he also walked on the BBC Music Awards and said , that they are only The Br@@ its &quot;
parliament &apos;s colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins reached the mission The Voice and said this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; turns into Classic FM , maintains a leading female member and increases new pressure on the transm@@ itter , to prove that he does something what the private it@@ ters do not do . &quot;
&quot; the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham was also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the public @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ er &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t use the word &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn Classic FM &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also sm@@ iled the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , appear to be The Br@@ its only under another name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples , where you actually only mim@@ ic what already exists on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
&quot; BBC @-@ General @-@ Director , the accus@@ ations , pointed back and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 stands far ahead of its commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and education to the public . &quot;
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , will I do nowhere in classical music any other way . &quot;
and there is a work for live music and music that is truly un@@ matched .
&quot; and the dedication of Radio 3 , to find new music and to give new works to order , I consider it really important &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the beginning of this year argu@@ ed the BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that harder to work on working to get the audience when it did so , because the British are less informed of classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio was not the only element of the BBC production , which performed during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport under fire , gr@@ ated commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins reached The Voice over - the musical talent show by the BBC , which was purchased by the Dutch manufacturer Tal@@ pa media for estimated costs of 22 million £ . &quot;
&quot; see what this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ? &quot;
Lord Hall was insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - was produced in special BBC ways .
&quot; he added , he wish that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit out of our in @-@ house stable &quot; , &quot; if it &apos;s the next time a entertainment series . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to ex@@ clude the order from the Voice of The Voice in the Future or spend money or pay@@ ers for other sub@@ categories . &quot;
Internet turnover in August on the slow and the Black Friday cannot be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in the online sales .
in the last month the lowest result since the recording of records in 2000 were announced .
online sales increased three years ago by using cell@@ phones to purchase
experts believe that the Black Friday presented the issues in November
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping basket has turned , and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain have turned into ha@@ ster@@ cities . &quot;
&quot; experts say that there are now signs that the on @-@ line revenue is stag@@ nat@@ ing , after new numbers were only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the total expenditure of August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of the record in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot;
experts say that there are signs that on @-@ sales will be st@@ agn@@ ant after new numbers only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the years and go back to 2000 , this has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG @-@ sales of the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that the online sales increases three years ago , as a buyer , started working with their own phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , for example at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now that &apos;s a thing , and we could possibly experience that growth is reduced . &quot;
&quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which is imported from America , is considered a reason for subsequent revenues . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that buyers have their purchases against this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times increased the average number of buyers to make their bar@@ gain , and some ret@@ ailer sites . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyer is cl@@ ashed for be@@ aks of cl@@ ashed , buyers can hold shopping . &quot;
a study of the British Retail Con@@ sortium did not take place $ 5 spending a little more than 1 £ online .
&quot; with some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out on web @-@ shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than one quarter of people wear clothing and shoes online instead of in the Mo@@ ve tracks into the interior . &quot;

&quot; the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency reported this detail not , but told that the management of the business was forbidden to travel . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man was reve@@ aling that which caused the overthrow of the crane , which rus@@ hed into a patio of the Grand mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , that happens later this month . &quot;
the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ Gruppe is not published any statements about the collapse of the Crane and its representatives were not at your disposal for an opinion .

&quot; this leads to that 200 more screen@@ fix , which aim at arti@@ sans , can be opened . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q outlets will close much &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef @-@ correspondence of the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is argu@@ ed that British hold its h@@ amm@@ ers and brush in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen , who carry out work in their homes . &quot;
if you are sent to a hammer or a brush for the ri@@ cher of walls you belong to a minority nowadays .
&quot; the British employ all the arti@@ sans , ask for do @-@ it jobs in their homes , such as the leader of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Véronique Lau@@ ry , new manager of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the Bau@@ ma chain , said that a large rise in the number of qualified craftsmen in Eastern Europe , offering services to civil prices in the meantime being over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; as such , King@@ fis@@ her , has plans to generate 200 further screen@@ ings , which are directed at arti@@ sans and close to 60 sales of B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q @-@ Shops , as eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are taken by women . &quot;
the men prevail the men at the moment .
&quot; she said it is necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends , producing more female single households , producing more ren@@ ditions than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we need to move it stronger towards a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our customers generated by 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles through women . &quot;
women play a large part in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of just five women listed on top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index listed by only five women , has also re@@ directed their top team to reflect equal numbers of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her is the only company who has occupied precisely 50 percent of the teams with women , including its management and financial status . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is a key topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ fis@@ her applied for a decline in the half @-@ year profit and the ou@@ tre@@ aches after the group completed the costs for the closing of the stores .
&quot; due to the trends will King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has , to open 200 new branches . &quot;
functional of A@@ I / DO@@ B due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity of the Court
&quot; at the national Court of Kl@@ agen@@ furt , on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volleyball court , A@@ I / DO@@ B had to be responsible for un@@ faithful and deport@@ ation . &quot;
the accused did not be guilty .
one of them had been charged with Am@@ t@@ sm@@ ite .
by this accus@@ ation he was acqu@@ itted of law in May legally .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the state @-@ state @-@ attorney Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary examination , the accused in the years 2006 to 2011 funds from associations , about whom they were dispos@@ ed in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
the damage to the damage was around 400,000 Euros .
the sports functions are also charged with financial statements .
&quot; this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , Rich@@ ke@@ Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
this is intended to be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the reason of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defense constitutes that the association had not ar@@ isen up an asset in any time . &quot;
&quot; the sports working would only be charged up el@@ astic compensation , and the Sport@@ club , for which it has been running from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money out of the debt - the pass@@ ana amo@@ unted to about 60@@ 0,000 Sch@@ illing ( rd . 44.@@ 90 euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time we were in front of the situation : do we continue to follow or block the club on ? &quot; , &quot; told by one of the accused , in the f@@ ot@@ vocation of the financial centre . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take this task . &quot;
with all the risks .
&quot; we have taken money , our life @-@ insurance as security in the bank will die , &quot; he said with the acceptance . &quot;
&quot; it has been agreed with the association : you can keep the money free , there must be no debt . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , - with the corresponding financial - success the payout of the charges was determined retro@@ actively by 1991 . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , one became a part of the charges compens@@ ations only years later , namely from the year 2003 when a plus had been in the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore even pau@@ lin and not detail bus@@ hings , explain the former ob@@ session descri@@ bing the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and au@@ xili@@ aries made the two def@@ endants in common , the second accused said . &quot;
why the exp@@ iry of the club were not detailed and asked the judge .
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial support , but it was important for debt recovery , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 against the an official investigation for Am@@ t@@ sm@@ iss@@ age , an amount of 120@@ .000 was transferred to the club . &quot;
&quot; they were to be appropri@@ ations , explained the def@@ endants . &quot;
this securities account was on the name of the second def@@ endants and was not known as the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; wanted to know the judge . &quot;
&quot; after that , the affirm@@ ation did not ask us a response . &quot;
&quot; finally he meant , he believed that this is the best for the association . &quot;
&quot; if he had happened something , nobody would have known anything of this money , the prosec@@ utor placed in the room . &quot;
&quot; the accused was informed , right @-@ up , the functional . &quot;
this transfer has been formulated as &quot; damages . &quot;
why claims to do ? they wanted to know the judge and the prosec@@ utor .
&quot; the first accused , he stated that he did not agree with this wording , because the association has never taken an damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; with whom you are all from the hook . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore the function@@ ary said , he has never extrac@@ ted a cent salary , but it only comp@@ uted to o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; in di@@ ets he made the association 1,000 euros per month in invoice , but the actual expenditure would have been much higher , he added . &quot;
precise documents for the early years were not allowed to pre@@ judge the def@@ endants .
&quot; these are after an examination , in which everything has been judged correctly , was no longer kept and explained . &quot;
mil@@ eage also had the second indic@@ tee for the first time .
&quot; all will be made in cash , that he has to drive from his residence to the Bank to B@@ lei@@ burg , in his opinion . &quot;
the main proceedings will continue on 23 September with the ques@@ tioning of witnesses .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : non @-@ violence in Serbian @-@ Hungarian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have taken up on the Ser@@ b border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water@@ lights against several hundred emerging refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Boz@@ si@@ k has experience the issue of non@@ violence .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees dro@@ pping the border .
behind it there had been a police force and behind the polic@@ emen were prepared a water@@ front .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees began to go on the officials with stones , sticks and plastic bottles . &quot;
the officials put up un@@ interrupted pepper spray .
&quot; afterwards , the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
a lot of tre@@ m@@ eng@@ as was scattered in the direction of the refugees .
this became the group dis@@ band@@ ed .
the refugees have now drawn something completely .

time of decision on interest rates for the EU database
&quot; the world has been observed if the US database is meeting on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision , whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates have been raised up or not . &quot;
&quot; survey among 80 econom@@ ists , who were questioned by Reu@@ ters , found that a little more than half the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 per cent . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rests on NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a big central bank leaves the zero @-@ sector and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , leading staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ llion dollars is added to the balance sheet and generate only a small inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ ffy view of global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it war@@ ns the markets to stop a raise , but the signs suggest that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday .
death Prot@@ ected on the Delta State University expressed ap@@ ology
&quot; after the shoot and shot of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning , and before he later started his colleague and killed a note to say that he would be &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; with the first murder and wanted to make it impossible , &quot; &quot; he could give it wrong &quot; , &quot; gave the authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi said that Lamb , lectur@@ er for geography and socio @-@ scientific education at the Delta State University , called emergency number 10 : 00 am Monday morning . &quot;
and he said he did go on someone who killed someone .
he told the staff of the emergency that the police gen@@ dar@@ es send their home to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; I sh@@ oss my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; in the house , but &quot; no one will inter@@ fere &quot; , &quot; but probably going to be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller according to his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lamb there was no explanation for his shots .
&quot; as the police wor@@ e the scene , they found the body of Amy pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 , which said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I couldn &apos;t do it . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , he &apos;s recorded 300 miles to Delta State University where he was taking E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , t@@ uns , before he eventually took his own life on Monday night , when gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ed him . &quot;
&quot; Universal President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he wis@@ s nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was a little in Mr Lam@@ b@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb is supposed to believe that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also dealt with Schmidt on Tuesday , there would give &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular connection . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she were about seven years married , as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced in the past 15 years ago , but they were friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ tles had a daughter who is 19 and she was destroyed . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ces accepted her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , after the statement of Lin@@ s@@ day K@@ now@@ les , which was identified from Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , had he with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said K@@ now@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , he played relatives at a certain point in Monday to tell them , &quot; he go not to the prison . &quot;
&quot; as a polic@@ eman it fet@@ ched him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later during that night , he &apos;s driving his car at the side , ran into the woods and red@@ dish himself with a shot . &quot;
he won a doctoral title in the spring of 2015 featuring the Delta State University . he likes his life on the University &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group
the Lufthansa is planning a large group of companies .
&quot; a half billion euros in the year , the Lufthansa Group wants to save on a better organization alone . &quot;
150 of the world around 1000 executives will cost the workplace plots .
&quot; with the pilot &apos;s union , there is in@@ significant negotiations . &quot;
the Lufthansa build up its corporate structure and adds value to the cheapest Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the goal of the real@@ ign@@ ment is a contribution to income of some 500 million euros a year out of cost and improvement of syner@@ gies , distributed the airline on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the Lufthansa will not play a board more for the passenger in the future . &quot;
the Bil@@ o@@ flu@@ in@@ y Euro@@ wings consoles will be developed as independently as possible .
in the previous team Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ aud for Euro@@ wings .
&quot; with the re @-@ presentation , Sp@@ oh@@ r points the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organisation of the 120 000 employees has been the complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines have to operate under the umbrella of the Passage Air@@ line Group , the three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion . &quot;
new negotiations with the Pil@@ ots
the collective bar@@ gaining with the pilot &apos;s cock@@ pit ( VC ) are intended to be resum@@ ed in the negotiations on the court @-@ paying dispute .
that distributed the union with us .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement rule for pil@@ ots .
&quot; cock@@ pit &quot; &quot; w@@ ool &quot; &quot; in a year with a forec@@ ast@@ ed record result &quot; as quickly as possible to sustainable results . &quot;
the conflict between the union and the Air@@ line led to various strikes in the past few months .
&quot; in addition to the transi@@ tional provision of the pil@@ ots , the spar@@ c concept is &quot; Wings . &quot; &quot;
it looks that Lufthansa in the fight against competi@@ tor will be exhibiting at the company &apos;s own Bil@@ li@@ gl@@ in@@ y Euro@@ wings .
under the title &quot; Morgen@@ zug &quot; in the south &quot; are paintings of Le@@ ena Krü@@ ger at the Julius @-@ House .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play on a monthly basis for double @-@ paid frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered in the Champions League of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven a double frac@@ ture of his right leg .
&quot; while it brought to the left outer def@@ enders for wines and ex@@ clude him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al won &apos;t hope that Sha@@ w may play back in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated 9 minutes on the playground and needed oxygen before it was brought to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg ac@@ upuncture and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will leave tomorrow or maybe one day later and then surgery in Manchester .
&quot; it is terri@@ bly - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then really plays , and then it happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen @-@ mask .
he cri@@ ed .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have double frac@@ ture , then the six months , and he will not be playing in the group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
&quot; Moreno seemed to be happy , a red card and the suspension of a sl@@ ate . &quot;
Nicola Riz@@ z@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , has not pun@@ ished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian Ar@@ bit@@ rators had been mist@@ aken .
&quot; you can judge for yourself , if I say that a El@@ f@@ meter and a red card have been charged . &quot;
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws Account said : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe how broken I am , my path to recovery begins now , I get more back again . &quot;
in doing : Manchester United saw the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat at the PS@@ V
the United Kingdom of England has an additional incentive to recover from the European Championship in France until the coming June .
&quot; Philli@@ p C@@ oc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; it is a very lim@@ b injury . &quot;
when a player left the place with this kind of injury the place are all very sad .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Moreno goes without a leg @-@ break when Mexico played at the World Cup 2014 at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he does so very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the enemy , and if you then hear it is a very lim@@ b injury , that is not good , &quot; C@@ oc@@ u said . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , who was in a different direction , so it didn &apos;t look like he &#91; Moreno &#93; was touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 said Moreno &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad doing it . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - according to a f@@ oul@@ ude by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not last long until you know it almost agile . &quot;
&quot; unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; asked as he asked by a provider of child@@ care systems , his favorite child &apos;s book was decided that Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which in 1971 were created by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult election , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , for it seems always a picture or a message that we have so far missed . &quot;
&quot; all nice and well @-@ out , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron alleg@@ edly describe the plot of book , instead describe a content of the film version of 2012 , the new characters and details added to expand the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , le@@ ased a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to see his desire to see a real tree , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage was lau@@ ded and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if that would not be suspic@@ ious enough : the text presented by Cameron is in part , as the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he tends to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is familiar with the act of book so little . here h@@ ears an un@@ active boy , like the local environment by the en@@ vision@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a hock@@ ey , straightforward being , &quot; which is talking in the name of the trees , &quot; des@@ olate . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR mission was deleg@@ ated in a hel@@ per that was not able to read a child for 20 times in a single child . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street speaker said that the text was probably got from cam@@ er@@ ons Leg@@ ter@@ round .
&quot; super@@ s confirmed that the text by Cam@@ er@@ ons had been delivered , but were no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still very difficult . &quot;
&quot; across Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , this is a difficult task , but if you selected the Ka@@ der to the England for the tour , there is a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test down@@ stream is not on my card . &quot;
I would not conclude an aw@@ ay@@ aw@@ eg course .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks Page can be experienced less than those three years ago , but there are good spin players located in the Batt@@ ing setting , and the joint spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a y@@ outh@@ ful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball Mo@@ een Ali as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an un@@ familiar size at the test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; in this message : Adam Ly@@ th dro@@ ves from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der , and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the decision to permit Adam Ly@@ th is of course to me as his boss @-@ trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyze . &quot;
&quot; during his seven tests there were two good attacks in difficult conditions , and the simple but harsh reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ ner are oriented to results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark upon Joe Roo@@ t , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this - players are their own best choice . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago he would have extended the run of Lydia , but he had control of his own destiny . &quot;
&quot; hopefully , when he strikes more sales for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be another chance . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not get so good performances , and this was not surprising me ; he is especially a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist receives to put its character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - when Nick Comp@@ ton had nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to return and play .
the only accus@@ ation that one can collect is that England first made Jonathan Dro@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was to be top - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex Hal@@ es comes inside and he is a head@@ man that I highly recommend .
he is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ aker where we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire quite early in this season when he had allowed 236 for us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge space that met us very much .
&quot; it has to obtain at least the same chances as the before him , but it depends of course on the team &apos;s im@@ position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to suggest Mo@@ een in addition to Cook , which would like to perform an extra spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and have received four tran@@ spir@@ es , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a stroke has not hit there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil of cri@@ cket @-@ player . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een perhaps does not have his job for his County Wor@@ ces@@ ter@@ shire , but is he a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my previous team mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined as a Open@@ er in 2001 .
he immediately got straight and looked back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as Back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited intercourse with him he impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his stat@@ s - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a plot , but there is no large number of backup ro@@ dents that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; aside from the crew , England made a few smart additions in the trainers . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Carolina , the batt@@ sman from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the testing games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nicest guys of the game that will bring an abundance of experience , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood has come for the white ball @-@ stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use to the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as players or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even though the news is in line with the aforementioned . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys Team@@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ ok@@ es , won &apos;t be used with the One @-@ Day@@ an , Roo@@ t received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team managers do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that like with players will depend on their jobs on the results .
such decisions are not made easy @-@ heart .
&quot; the Bre@@ xit calls ( Bre@@ xit = exit Britain from the EU ) could win to Zul@@ u , when the economy takes into a vial device by 2017 . &quot;
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ balanced blend @-@ out strategy to keep Britain in the EU will come deeper into trouble with each day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who viol@@ ate itself due to Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners have also their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Nig@@ el Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at and said rest@@ less that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angl@@ ed into different crises , as the EU is now and not always from the own guilt of Britain itself , who found it mostly not want to be filled with . &quot;
&quot; Bright@@ on decided the TU@@ C at its Annual General Meeting , that it may not like it if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
&quot; prime minister and finance ministers have clim@@ bed to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they can win alliances for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who want an outdoor @-@ looking Great Britain in the inside of the EU tent , &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets us feel more short @-@ sight@@ ed ministers and officials in some capitals to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we remain or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an ally lit , but she has been going to power for 10 years before it looks bad for her , as it has happened for the exagger@@ ated hard@@ ship such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande looks ahead to his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ ending power .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist rights government , Spain left a left . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will be a pl@@ edge to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be used better to prevent Scotland from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even visi@@ bly dis@@ cour@@ aged notes , entirely in the SN@@ P @-@ style , during the British referendum , in order to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , suspected my friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ note , and &quot; &quot; great Britain has won &apos;t be anything of the value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how ri@@ ber@@ ish the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU @-@ scep@@ tic is the oligar@@ chy of the Press@@ eb@@ ar@@ one , like she did not have been supporting our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they are able to rec@@ ede weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ euro opportun@@ ists who made a name for himself as an &quot; &quot; EU @-@ ban@@ anas ban@@ anas in Brussels &quot; . &quot; &quot;
with all his mad@@ ness he knew Ed Mili@@ band who were his enemies .
&quot; this belonged to the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing masks , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ aged foreigners and the pseudo @-@ In@@ countries that possess most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bl@@ air was thinking about it , but indicated that when you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you put better ban@@ anas in order to distr@@ act him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , mili@@ tia was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ an as a bl@@ air itself , as he ref@@ ra@@ ined from Cam@@ er@@ ons speaker , because Bl@@ air has rejected the principle of the non @-@ fourth Constitution of the EU who was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 that opened his back door . &quot;
the press has never visited him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me on Monday in Westminster , a friendly l@@ apse on the back - I told him that he would have no time to spend more time for me - appears in danger , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ but strategy of the 80 @-@ er years to repeat , an error then and now . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , the BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position to Europe is - I feel friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a Re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional bl@@ az@@ ar@@ b @-@ tendency and the wil@@ der hy@@ bri@@ ds of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ German can be said yes everyone can say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but not a Ben@@ n@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said that Cor@@ by@@ no appointing the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a sh@@ att@@ ler was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year old , when his old father volunte@@ ered to be able to go well loyal to his labor cabinet and without losing his cabinet @-@ job . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s battle was still more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Ben@@ ns expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C spoke to his fellow ben@@ ites and MEP , according to all reports on their agenda on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the tou@@ ching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n is trying - remember that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and above all in the spiral of social media , a brood @-@ site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ y@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Cameron can give no freedom of free tickets for Europe that allowed him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the ant@@ en@@ sil@@ ring campaign , such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic ambig@@ uous activities - in accordance with its Ben@@ n@@ ite si@@ ege @-@ economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ si@@ sts , for which the Nar@@ cis@@ s@@ m of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ uous activities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is un@@ confident that J@@ C does not start a campaign to res@@ ign - will foreign diplom@@ ats become committed to try to find out in all a sense of their superi@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin turn to political capital - they also have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all can be meaning@@ less ? &quot;
&quot; the U.S. is already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of the start of the Monday of what is called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts criti@@ ci@@ ze the report of Public Health England on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking out of a meeting of 12 people , partially with links to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined The Lanc@@ et that they criti@@ ci@@ ze the post of Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; p@@ he published the &quot; &quot; grade report &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the res@@ ili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et Last month attacked the &quot; &quot; extremely win@@ dy foundation &quot; &quot; that expl@@ ores the most important conclusion on the p@@ he . &quot;
two further researchers have to write in BM@@ J and have asked whether the alleg@@ ations &quot; on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tro@@ pical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said the public is expecting the statement of p@@ he that &quot; &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi@@ pl@@ ot@@ rit@@ eria @-@ decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions about the damage caused by various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ hal@@ ogen@@ ous products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose Managing Director was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco instrument ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also wrote the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants said at the meeting to get funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes maker but not financing , which he should have received after reports before by the Tab@@ ak@@ company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the body are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also specify a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in the tobacco control .
at the meeting was the tobacco management of p@@ he participated .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; fl@@ ees t@@ ell@@ ingly , that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence of the damages &quot; most products with most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or limitations in the p@@ he report will be discussed . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the claims of p@@ he that &quot; &quot; so far there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes serve as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot;
&quot; pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he , told that the alleg@@ ations of BM@@ J was previously re@@ acted . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ life smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggest that health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes compared to that are minor but that we still have to study the long @-@ term effects .
&quot; p@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence is , and what is not , particularly when there is so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0,000 people die yearly in a disease regarding smoking , and smoking will cost the national health system two billion € per year . &quot;
&quot; through the clear pre@@ face of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; follow @-@ out , on the BBC to go to East@@ En@@ ders , says former Chief of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should cease to send programs such as East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals is giving their right arm &quot; for hit @-@ shows like the Albert Square L@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the Rund@@ funk@@ y was to be used only to make the kind of programs which cannot be sent through other UK channels .
&quot; he criti@@ ci@@ zed the BBC that they are publicly known for public @-@ legal programs which are probably viewed by a smaller audience , in hard contro@@ versy with the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and channels like BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General Manager , Tony Hall , Tony Hall said the company wanted to work more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he has been trying to contact Channel 4 without success in his time at Channel 4 without success . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs can be commissioned or sends , which would also be clearly demonstrated by un@@ conventional ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson , the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee under his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to keep the round of broad@@ casting , what I think about mid@@ - or long term does not consider a good idea , one should at least use it on programs that others do not make or order . &quot;
you send The Voice in a first @-@ class window because they want to achieve a wid@@ est possible support for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it is ridicul@@ ous , it is of course nonsense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs could be financed without subsidies .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
let me see how this should be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t believe this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , an ent@@ repr@@ en@@ eur for series , acting Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews unless for the ambitions of the people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments about the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC will return to what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ ri@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 proposed that the BBC shows how East@@ In@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs can go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where one can &apos;t judge the audience , but they perform their tasks , and they can argue when they have created all these obsc@@ ure tools that nobody has seen all these obsc@@ ure programs . &quot;
they put them into a window of window where no one would ever wanted to see .
&quot; to broad@@ casting , Johnson said to the committee &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more rainy system in terms of conditions , who can obtain the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course , remember all that one gets a great value for 150 £ per year , but for people who is for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me whether that &apos;s true , because they consume no much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ Chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , asked that the BBC will review its maturity and mission to educate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little of the BBC &apos;s production would now officially classi@@ fy as education - he said that there is 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio , and it should be specialised in public @-@ law TV@@ s in Australia and Canada , taking an example in &quot; &quot; inform and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms of which he said that only a handful of television will go in , and engage with the commercial sin@@ uses alliances to make everything online available . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ hal@@ e@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sil@@ k@@ shafts
&quot; the video shows how the Nem@@ ean will change the direction in the moment , in which it may be pun@@ ished with sound impul@@ ses . &quot;
scientists have re@@ ared wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nerv@@ ousness that can be controlled by tri@@ vi@@ als of sound @-@ waves .
&quot; the tiny n@@ emat@@ ography are changing the direction in the moment , in which they have sound impul@@ ses , which have a high frequencies for human hearing , to be heard . &quot;
pul@@ ses are working through the switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are changed gene@@ tically to carry the membrane sub @-@ channels that respond to ultr@@ as@@ ound waves .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the wor@@ ms pointed the power of a new procedure , called son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics , which can be used to activate a number of brain , cardi@@ ac and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day stimulation can replace the rec@@ ated method that lead the electrical impul@@ ses into the brain of symptoms of Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; stran@@ gl@@ ers usually do not react to ultr@@ as@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bli@@ sters , he found out , reinforce the ultr@@ as@@ ound @-@ waves , which can then enter into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the reinforced ultr@@ as@@ ound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms cells .
&quot; the waves effect the opening of these organisms , and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report of Nature Communications . &quot;
to create ultr@@ as@@ ound @-@ controlled em@@ ato@@ des ; Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ens are wearing TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels .
&quot; when he turns out ultr@@ as@@ ound to the changed creatures , the sound @-@ waves are reinforced by the micro @-@ flowers and switch to the wor@@ ms , where they turn the changed Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool , the scientist receives , neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light and dis@@ able . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ic@@ e@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; unlike light , that in an optical fiber has to be shipped to the desired location in the brain , low @-@ frequency @-@ ultr@@ as@@ ound tissues can happen and can be sent into the brain from above on the sk@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the imp@@ ly human neur@@ ons temporarily pr@@ one to the ultr@@ as@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insul@@ in producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules to live in student dormit@@ ories
&quot; eleven years ago I moved as self @-@ for@@ get@@ away 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student dormit@@ ory , but only now I remember the tense smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and passed to the numerous , leg@@ alistic discomfort over others . &quot;
most of what I have learned is di@@ sti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the de@@ duc@@ er in student dormit@@ ory varies from slightly nerve @-@ wr@@ aps up to a fright@@ ening point .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to sk@@ et@@ ches : people tell wh@@ ence you come , whether and where you have taken to you , because in real , guys , there is only a yeast hair@@ s , because in the Ernst , guys , it is just a fe@@ ather ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Make your questions and show interest .
&quot; it draws the conversation and helps you find out the people that you like in contrast to those with which you would not speak , even if your eyelashes are gr@@ ated in fire and extingu@@ ishers . &quot;
leave people .
&quot; rooms of people often turn into drinks of recipes , film @-@ night venues and local hits : but they are also the places where people prefer and under@@ wear their under@@ wear . &quot;
related to this : do not think to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a cru@@ de treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refu@@ ge , but many student dormit@@ ories form a space @-@ to @-@ space @-@ b@@ um@@ mel culture , which can be friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be the hell of someone who is temp@@ ted to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I will that our friendship continue , but you have to move away , so that I get the energy back that I consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
&quot; try to sense when a cl@@ as@@ signing is exhausted from convi@@ vi@@ ality , and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cked . &quot;
A@@ pro@@ pos si@@ lo@@ ps : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a non @-@ closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
emp@@ athy and friendship through b@@ aking .
&quot; since you begin the university on the climax of Back @-@ Man@@ ie , the l@@ apping of the doors of people to get themselves with a plate of brow@@ ni@@ es , less stran@@ gely than the welcome from the 1950 @-@ er years &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I &apos;ve looked after you . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade apple offer is a good way to make friends .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates are oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain and will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends if you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; bad mixed results from flour , sugar and fat lead to the fact that people face sleeping when you drop . &quot;
ste@@ al foods is a most important crime in school residence .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ch of chicken is a rob@@ bery , but is it the take of a drop of milk for your tea also ? &quot;
check that with the dairy owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say , to operate even when they cook in the inside . &quot;
&quot; when someone on your stuff , is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my ro@@ ommate @-@ hostess , who put your milk into a dishwasher to pun@@ ish di@@ ebe . &quot;
it is now in prison .
you should not make noise extract people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not just about being a decent human being , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people that are sitting in the glass building . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neighbors , if it makes them something out , Drum &amp; Bass some qui@@ eter , because it was 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
you re@@ acted to it with even more tur@@ tle music .
&quot; when they finally heard about 5 am , they left their neighbors still two hours sleeping , before they left their own music , shut their door and settled down to their three @-@ hour exam . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would happen to be acci@@ dental to the same student residence ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it would not be very embarrassing for you to hold a ro@@ ommate for your future sp@@ ouses to join her again and then have to see her again every day and maybe experience how to bring together to them all together ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own paths - but when the name is ro@@ ommate is definitely not your future sp@@ inning in , try to talk at least to chat a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has its key in its not vei@@ led room , the border between a Ul@@ k and Mob@@ bing has become more than it seems . &quot;

Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : mass accommodation in containers or athle@@ tic has no sustainability .

&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say , it is back peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can easily be changed according to your needs .
how much is the cost ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house in € 184 , without land . &quot;
this is over@@ man@@ age@@ able .
six months the construction has taken place .
this is reasonable .
do the building rules make their plans too complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : &quot; right now I have drawn my project correctly .
especially complicated it always makes the dro@@ pping D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ ingly special and the actu@@ ality rules .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
&quot; it is still sub@@ ordin@@ ated , who creates three apartments in a matur@@ ation house , needs at least three places . &quot;
only in the cities is missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers do not have cars .
how did the inhabitants react to their maturity project ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : there were , which made me thre@@ w , luxury built for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
what is definitely not right .
but does not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competi@@ tor rate for paid @-@ in homes ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : true : we have been a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but built luxury homes that can afford to afford more . &quot;
my project has the message as well as the normal people need living @-@ ups .
&quot; not only refugees , but also the only mother @-@ out mother or the bar@@ ley @-@ serving . &quot;
I am showing how one can still grow comfortably and well today .
that is what it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the adjustment app , to &quot; &quot; general &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; Software @-@ Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install Inst@@ all . &quot;
&quot; some have come to the installation on issues , as they receive a error message that fail the &quot; &quot; software update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to handle the problem , users will be recommended to either wait until the crash goes back or trying to update over iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean the clear@@ ing of apps to create space - but Apple has made it easier to do so , if you use a special tool using apps , and then install them again as soon as the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charging system , so that the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; if the cargo is too low , Apple does not leave that the update will continue , since the phone could possibly change half @-@ way roads and result it to a break @-@ up of the updates . &quot;

there has recently been opened a new Qu@@ arti@@ san office .
&quot; here , directly beside the market market , you will immediately receive seniors and advice information on questions like to care and care or services of health care and nursing homes . &quot;
since years we have been established with our out@@ patient care center that often car@@ egi@@ vers are left alone .
&quot; thus , there are infin@@ itely many questions . &quot;
&quot; not too many benefits of the masses are not used , because the complexity of insur@@ ances will hardly ever be understood , &quot; explained the new land@@ lady in Jut@@ ta W@@ eig@@ and , which is responsible for treas@@ ury and civil don@@ ital as well as for the out @-@ patient service &quot; Amadeus &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; besides the consultation the new qu@@ arti@@ san office offers also prevention , health care and wellness . &quot;

the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention and pensions and Reh@@ a .
&quot; the senior centre of care and care , &quot; &quot; Heike R@@ ie@@ del , CEO of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new qu@@ iring offices in the city can be seen particularly in demo@@ graphic change .

Dr. Frank Müller deals with practice Fel@@ ste@@ ausen and investing 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen .
we are also pleased to over@@ hau@@ ling Bernd Bor@@ mann and Economic Cooperation in Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
&quot; in many places in the countryside , doctors - As@@ endorf against the other hand are lucky : there Dr. Frank Müller took over in practice in practice . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen enters into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is his successor in the next few months ahead of her successor . &quot;
&quot; after a construction phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he is investing 3@@ 10000 Euro to the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us Road 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy to the first glance , when the field of interpre@@ ters met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently completed their professional development in the agricultural hospital and comm@@ end the year into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen and laugh@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; when I was there , I just inv@@ oked it . &quot;
couple Müller turned the idea to operate in As@@ endorf in the future in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and continuous contact to the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families through the years , &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also see , soon his own chef will be . &quot;
and so you agree that the gar@@ bage purchased the house with the practice .
living will continue to live in frag@@ hausen Vil@@ sen .
&quot; there is a two @-@ fold family father Frank Müller raised , his medicine studies in Hanover followed in Hanover , and in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , N@@ ien@@ burg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently working as a senior assistant in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was appointed as Chief Not@@ a doctor in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved with volunteers in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of the Berlin Vil@@ hausen . &quot;
&quot; as of 19 September , the practice for the new boss will be prepared . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ste@@ ausen , on the surgeon , his wife Ur@@ sel ( boarding ) has specialised in the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the gar@@ bage , both interested , want to serve as a household . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
after the reconstruction , the rooms will be modern look . &quot;
we will offer more ultr@@ as@@ ound studies as well as long @-@ term and res@@ ili@@ ence EK@@ GS and need an inter@@ iors .
the ED@@ V is also completely renewed .
&quot; a grant from a total of 500,000 Euros to be given for the gar@@ bage under a funding programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and glad we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; empha@@ sized the stu@@ ff@@ ed master Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; about 2000 patients arrive according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll every quarter at the practice Fel@@ ste@@ ausen , in the North German A@@ verage practice it is about 500 . &quot;
in As@@ endorf there is also another home office .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practice approval by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if not a successor would have been found it would have gone .
&quot; who was attended by Miller &apos;s talk , continues to looks ahead of everything in familiar faces : accepts the seven medical specialist and the cleaning power from the fields . &quot;
by their departure ends in As@@ endorf that era after all the medi@@ ators have been doing there for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; rec@@ alls &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen sch@@ mun@@ ching . &quot;
a little sad@@ ness she felt after the long time .
&quot; but we live in in Hohen@@ moor and so many patients will certainly see , &quot; says the boarding . &quot;
&quot; her husband is compl@@ em@@ ented : &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 meter site . &quot;
&quot; so far , I have always pushed me up in front of gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
also the couple has two grand@@ children and travels happy .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; the border controls can also be done at our southern border , &quot; said Minister of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel with this .
&quot; still , as before , everyone who wants to place a asylum application , this can be done without saying . &quot;
the care and safety of the people stand in the foreground .
&quot; but it is clear , however , that it takes significant signals , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
people must know that we do not accept the bound@@ less migration flows but not over the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia reduced &quot; cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia
the Croatian government had previously communicated that Slovenia to continue to continue to continue to come toward Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; in this way , this interior of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ t Z@@ ni@@ dar in Stav@@ anger does not see . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather serve the surveillance of the border - especially among Hungary . &quot;
Croatia &apos;s border with Croatia is already strongly checked out as the border of the Schengen area .
&quot; as the minister stressed , Sloven@@ es wants to trust in that its borders for refugees but not . &quot;
&quot; each EU member must fill its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ mer Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; like the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours of Tuesday to travel in Eastern Croatian at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in order to do@@ dge the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could reach them in the near cor@@ n@@ fields .
according to local media we have since been meeting a police member of the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik and new refugees .
&quot; it is mostly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children . &quot;
also lif@@ ebo@@ at and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days his country with around 4,000 refugees said Minister of R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
&quot; moreover , buses from Pres@@ evo at the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border that have so far been emig@@ rated to the Hungarian border to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade uph@@ eld , however , that they should take it to take certain routes : &quot; neither can we nor do we do this , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; according to media outlets , in the morning , a first bus arrived with around 50 refugees in the Ser@@ b border town of Si@@ d , the running of the day would be expected for more buses . &quot;
&quot; across Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the passengers spent the entire night of about 500 kilometres away from the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary made it , so the police told us that we should go there , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
this could actually be actually the case of ob@@ serving the predicted shift of the former Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west of the east .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive ways of border control &quot;
Croatia Interior O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously argu@@ ed that his country prepared for the fall of a strong state of refugees corresponding plans for possible outcome situations .
&quot; he did not calling him , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen group &quot; have &quot; comprehensive ways of border control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they lead strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners since 2007 put a good testimony to the standards of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on Serbian side , behind the Hungarian border @-@ au@@ n , about 300 refugees continue to be established . &quot;
&quot; according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media , they would have spent the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
according to the Hungarian authorities the two border crossing Hor@@ go and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely locked .
&quot; if the remaining refugees would now want to continue to the Croatian border , it is still unclear . &quot;
the Serbian interior of N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm on Wednesday at a local assignment in Hor@@ go : he ret@@ aining the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for breakfast .
it would not currently be a very high refugee solution .
they can &apos;t say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers rates migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee centres have already begun to distribute the refugees trying to explore alternative routes through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the bor@@ derland between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area , there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not vac@@ ated min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of de@@ mining was sent in the border region .

&quot; it &apos;s all about life , so with this action we went into the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the mission of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ Aid for questions and talks is available for questions and discussions as volunteers .

&quot; repeatedly , on the edge of small discussions on the action began , life and death . &quot;
also Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is just on site .
&quot; only when I make clear that for me eventually the end of this world comes , I can live more responsible , &quot; says the director of the Diak@@ onischen Wer@@ kes Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband carriers of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ es . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public promotion has become effective for 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; however , not everyone wants to announce publicly on the tablets , be understandable , eventually it was a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the topic of death and death was per@@ si@@ sted with Tab@@ us , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the experience of the Hosp@@ it@@ movement in recent years have helped a lot to open up to the people . &quot;
a view to shares the Angel@@ ika Go@@ ic@@ ro@@ id .
the dying and bit@@ ching companion belongs to the volunteers from the first hour .
&quot; by personal experience facing the theme , she read a lot of literature and decided to be involved in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ it@@ ors sought volunteers , she immediately reported and was with the foundation in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ broken ro@@ id is a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes , and in the hosp@@ ice Saint Vincent . &quot;
all of them are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ broken ro@@ id can handle well with her function and the experiences made and experience .
&quot; I see life from another war@@ nings , keep it for precious and guess the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of the Ambul@@ ant Ö@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ es Service is free of charge and con@@ fes@@ sions .
the financial support of the health care and donations of relatives and associations enable the training as well as further training and super@@ visor of the mortality and female companion .
&quot; every two years , training courses are offered for new employees . &quot;
&quot; the boards described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the protest@@ ant church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) . &quot;

&quot; despite the price increase , the average view comes in spite of the price increase that will be an average of 4.3 percent and in spite of higher attacks for ground@@ transpor@@ ters of heavy and large packages , which will be accumulated from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it is still ongoing that the result was increased compared to the previous year , due to cost reductions , higher revenue and due to growth in online trade . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the firm talks &quot; solid re@@ y@@ ields , &quot; when one regards the weaker and expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for the holiday @-@ employment were announced a day later than that of the Ri@@ val UPS who plans to specify 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5.000 additional labour , roughly the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than last year . &quot;
&quot; the earnings per share reached this $ 1000 per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research and asked an@@ al@@ ysts di@@ ct . &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of z@@ acks asked an@@ al@@ ysts expected to $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years , Fed@@ Ex has gone a decline in the international primary shipment , which brought the turnover in its unit express @-@ shipping . &quot;
but the boom in online @-@ shopping has raised the results at Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter sales of soil transport increased by 29 per cent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit distinguished superior revenues due to higher rates , while the result for improved working costs in the cargo business . &quot;
&quot; in the market market , about an hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares are about 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;
on Tuesday they opened 11 percent loss for year and 17 percent under a record high on 11 June .
&quot; on their most expected meeting in the year Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ egen , two days spent this week around a 27 @-@ minute boom @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to lift the benchmark for nearly a decade . &quot;
&quot; Dro@@ ho@@ bic on them at the end of the stream , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed sitting room is a m@@ ural of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ Chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ella and their colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold order from Congress : maxim@@ ization of US jobs and prices remain stable .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed guide have recognised that there is a dis@@ car@@ eless mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate might be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ di@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the U.S. economy is getting ready to be reconc@@ iled by the un@@ parall@@ elled reason due to the next short term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to increase these vol@@ ati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for government bonds - and be it only for one quarter percent@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation is primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lin@@ d@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief econom@@ ists at the Mak@@ ler@@ firm Sti@@ ll Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text , the interest rate would not increase , the increased in@@ security around the global market is sufficiently justi@@ fication , continued to wait , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is going to be made by themselves the financial market .
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , were asked recently from Bloomberg &apos;s representatives , have predicted that week interest . &quot;
&quot; financial markets expect a l@@ ending of the barrels with a key indicator , who only shows a 30 % chance of a raise . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline of the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists cut the blow , by promising the further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday j@@ umped from the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value to 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or around 1.1 % to 16.@@ 5@@ 99@@ ,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy is holding the set in this week , John Lon@@ ski , Chief Con@@ gen@@ ome said with Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the propositions at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does it , she needs to go very far in its explanation to re@@ assure the financial markets , so that they will not panic attack in panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argu@@ ed that a zinc asser@@ tion would calm the financial markets , because they would solve the in@@ security when the F@@ ed act , would eliminate . &quot;
&quot; just before a month , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set of .@@ percent@@ ages this month , the first small step in a slow shar@@ pen@@ ing of mon@@ ary conditions that would test the strength of relaxation in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ els had said in spring and in early summer , that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als that would require more economic progress , an increase in the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , improving the labour market in this year was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate rose to 5,@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the levels , which sees the F@@ ed as full employment . &quot;
wage levels have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation continued under the goal of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives said , the main reason said the temporary effect of considerably lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; &quot; can overcome higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief Con@@ oma at Pan@@ theon Macro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets spread over the world at the end of the last month after China had de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
&quot; the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value fell in May by more than 16 % below his peak , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy was the global growth of th@@ rot@@ tles . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered to this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now at almost 10 % below the H@@ och of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market uph@@ e@@ av@@ al influence the complex calculation , when you should raise interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy has failed to occur in the last few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fellow at U@@ C@@ LA C@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the United States database . &quot;
he predicted that they will wait at least one month to better get the effects better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what effects will be on the U.S. economy and there is almost no reliable data that describe developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the main priorities of the F@@ ed , so she should not be involved in their decision making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Fund has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere consideration of that former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could be able to produce their mon@@ th@@ ary expansion &quot; , &quot; b@@ lowing confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly si@@ sted can be expected from the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives , that they will not only be monitoring the developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; its decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of re@@ actions on financial market movements , which seems to be linked to the commercial fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; a member of the Federal Open Market Committee , a member of the Federal Open Market Committee , applies to a zinc period , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its gu@@ z@@ ins to mark &quot; &quot; percent@@ ages in three sessions &quot; &quot; despite limited recognition effects on growth in the U.S. &quot; , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives used these reductions .
&quot; F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis like the mar@@ ch@@ ment of 2008 to the first place , Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on interest rates of the Bank of England . &quot;
the recent turbul@@ ence come not close to this level ; he said .
&quot; she certainly wants to go into the situation when they are afraid of a fork altitude because the markets were turned , &quot; &quot; P@@ ants , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think they should go ahead of the time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive at this day in Germany .
to prepare you for a warm welcome not without the commitment of un@@ willing and volunteer .
&quot; also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are quite a number of people who support an un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city . &quot;
among them belong Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ ein is with body and soul teacher .
even with their 74 L@@ enzen they are still taught .
every Thursday she does in the asylum seeker at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , the Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , the whole of other classes are regarded as being at the right school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric Society Rio Grande promotes diet for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian organisation SP@@ RS is trying to clarify in sho@@ cking the women how important good nutrition during breast@@ feeding mothers . she does this with the presentation of images of babies which are inf@@ ant with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
&quot; mother &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins , and carbohydrates , which babies give all nutrients that they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers come to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake to increase around 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that should make the mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted under the direction of Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet wi@@ red women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal mo@@ ried authorized the construction order for the 2.3 million Euros expensive sports hall .
and he did an exception .
the roof must be f@@ acher for solar installation .
&quot; the plans for the long @-@ managed Turn@@ hall@@ ulture at Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ forum are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent municipal council , the signed building contract was secured without large discussions . &quot;
&quot; previously , the Plat@@ forms had another application for a &quot; &quot; dedicated &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid construction plan . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it used to make the permission for a special form regarding construction construction . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; saddle @-@ roof @-@ roof &quot; &quot; is intended to be built with non @-@ minded First and Dach@@ man@@ ned &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar installations : &quot; &quot; therefore , we get a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; in turn was on the sky@@ line that is prescribed for energy reasons - different than in the building plan - below ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan has no &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der &apos;s community must be del@@ ayed rather restric@@ tive in the proceeds of the conflict . &quot;
&quot; however , at Turn@@ ech@@ oes &quot; , &quot; however , is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; we create no preced@@ ent &quot; , &quot; thus St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gymn@@ as@@ onry at the sports centre is a communal project in the community and the SV of Bern@@ ried .
some costs approximately 2.3 million Euros have been calculated .
subsidies are expected from the school and municipal sports promotion .
the next process of proced@@ ural forces will now be tabl@@ ed for the 18 x 36 meters high hall now the land@@ holder for testing .
Clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is scheduled to be closed as planned - namely 2016 .
simultaneously Dr Wilhelm Fischer will become the Executive Director at the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of the employees are moving from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this was the unexpected plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , the land@@ lady Andrea Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White confirmed . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision to go ahead is the Supervisory Board and the h@@ unted to the next Wednesday , 23 . September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans are implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority should be moved with fishermen and the further existing station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the employees , who cannot be offered to Sch@@ ong@@ au , is to be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
the staff were informed of the plans .
&quot; triggered the change by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only changed since the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic and now changed to a private office in direct proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; in the question of who is to start the succession , came according to Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; into the game , who agreed to take the line from October 1st and to change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is in any case a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and an extensions of the offer in the &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; , &quot; said Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for the heart @-@ by and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised in the interior station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic disorders .
&quot; within the next two years we shall run fishermen with his team , if the Supervisory Board agree to the people of dec@@ eit , both of the houses , until then the next year the former hospital stay , which has over 35 beds , in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg , has finally been closed for almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the region had planned this by 2018 , when the current renovation at the hospital Wei@@ l@@ heim was completed . &quot;
&quot; An@@ tim@@ ber@@ tin Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ Weiß , which is also Chairman of the board of directors , entered rum@@ ors to the house which is owned by the Federal Minister , will be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this I close I off . as it continues with the property , Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ Weiß did not say , there was several refl@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; at present , there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; what could not happen to us , such an occasion did not come back &quot; , &quot; so Fischer over the Qu@@ asi @-@ Mo@@ ve to Le@@ ch , who has been received positively by the employees &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , which has been the chief psych@@ ologist for more than 30 years , have not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of medical director .
&quot; in the past decades the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened with closing , divisions were shut down , for example the surgery and the mid@@ wife . &quot;
the Hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are required today ( 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .
&quot; the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga is in Wuppertal , the clear favorite , cause for pre@@ tension but none . &quot;
in the last season the bath@@ ener at the B@@ HC is a pain@@ less defeat and have something to use .
dar@@ ker case with two wounded
two tractor @-@ drivers are seriously in@@ ju@@ red during their Ma@@ is@@ ern@@ al afternoon on the after@@ no@@ ons .
&quot; during the Aber@@ nt@@ berg near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use as the police are w@@ edge . &quot;
&quot; after a return , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought in hospitals . &quot;
&quot; how exactly it could come to the accident , was first unclear . &quot;
the crime police must be determined .
miss 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate victims of violence broke
a suspic@@ ious has brought the police to the suffering of 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate .
&quot; in the trial , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was killed , young people killed and their cor@@ pse was thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
a third @-@ year @-@ old 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate is fallen victim to non @-@ violent crimes .
&quot; the woman of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen during the Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as pro@@ secution and police in the Wednesday medium . &quot;
&quot; it was also the chief of 20 @-@ year @-@ old , which had the fact been stated accordingly and investig@@ ating the investig@@ ator to the foundations of the body . &quot;
the 16 year @-@ old had already been reported on Sunday morning after having arrived at the eve after a visit to a fall in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen was no matter how they agreed upon arrival .
&quot; in finding the young women , the investig@@ ators first wrote on personal items of the victim &apos;s sacrifice . &quot;
&quot; in surveys in the friend and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the hearing , finally there was a crime against the 20 year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ fl@@ edged perpet@@ rators brought the police into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found . &quot;
&quot; the det@@ ector gave the authorities finally in the police court , who were killed 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ pse in the channel . &quot;
&quot; the 20 year @-@ old should be carried out at the port of Haf@@ ling@@ erie , the investig@@ ators put his eye for the burden . &quot;
trans@@ gres@@ sions about the approaching circumstances of the act should bring further exploration .
refugees need accommodation : trial war@@ ns in front of houses
the situation on the German market market is tense .
and ever more refugees look for paying bond .
the pressure on the market market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution of participation in the German dor@@ sal market have long been begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and unemployed people from the EU , more and more people are moving towards a market that is now clear in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with en@@ qu@@ eu@@ weak citizens for the last paid apartments .
&quot; to cover the demand for affordable housing , we had to build 400,000 new units by 2020 . &quot;
a study takes place on behalf of the union of social housing &quot; Social housing . &quot;
&quot; by comparison , this year in Germany 26@@ 0,000 units are finished . &quot;
&quot; thus , 140,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; refugees are no longer obliged after the first three months of their stay , as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation . &quot;
many come across the face @-@ market and join in the long ser@@ p@@ ents against the flats .
&quot; according to the Federal Office of the Federal Office , in the last year , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers were to rent . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the living labour market does not only lie in the growing wave of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes considerable om@@ is@@ sions in the construction sector of recent years .
&quot; Germany has put a budget deficit in front of itself , which gets bigger from year to year . &quot;
&quot; current missing in the metropol@@ itan areas is already around 77@@ 0,000 d@@ well@@ ings , lam@@ ents Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals have therefore lived in large @-@ cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed un@@ voluntarily due to the har@@ ming on the apartment market unfortunately no longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
&quot; in large cities , the number of square meter per head has fallen in the past years for the first time . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the coalition &quot; &quot; Social Building &quot; &quot; proposes a rest@@ art . &quot;
this is meant to rest@@ art new incentives for social housing .
&quot; this could be wai@@ ved on the tre@@ ad tax , and the basic tax for sponsored apartments will be suspended . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they are necessary to apply attractive tax @-@ tax returns . &quot;
the support programme for Refu@@ ge@@ es of the K@@ f@@ W costs are already well received at cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start was Saturday , with 184 million Euros already more than half of the total available around 300 million euros . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be rus@@ hed . &quot;
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia are set up cor@@ r@@ dor
&quot; after Hungary , practically no more , no more refugees choose the way over Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb An@@ no@@ un@@ ces to allow the trip across Slovenia to the North without a hur@@ dle .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to explore Slovenia &apos;s neighbour with Slovenia &apos;s establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked to the Sloven@@ ian inner @-@ minist@@ er , and when it is necessary we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of En@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria , and belongs to the Schengen area . &quot;
the EU @-@ Land of Croatia has not been a Schengen passport .
&quot; after the break @-@ up of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe . &quot;
500 people were raised over the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik and reported on the Croatian television station RT@@ L .
Hungary carried its border on its border to refugees on the day before .
&quot; new laws , which performed on the same day in force , make clear asylum in Hungary practically super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen .
&quot; Croatian Minister of Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic explained : &quot; &quot; you can travel through , and we prepare for that possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and to achieve something . &quot;
&quot; but , there are people who do not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
Croatian police had picked up the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbouring country .
&quot; most of the articles were reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
you came by bus and cab@@ s into the Serbian border town Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival they had tried to get walking on the green border to Croatia .
&quot; indeed , on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees not across the border . &quot;
&quot; for this , the border ro@@ ams other dangers , there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
Min@@ en@@ vi@@ ans should quickly create a safe passage .
the refugees arrive after the closing of the border with no more refugees .
on Tuesday the police counted 36@@ 6 sub@@ mits people .
shortly before the decision on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian law steps the overthrow and dam@@ aging of the border to us as a criminal off@@ ense .
&quot; in the south @-@ Hungarian border @-@ border to Sz@@ eged , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated . &quot;
this split @-@ down penalty stro@@ kes up to five years and the deport@@ ation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , the dates of the immigration authority took its mark on Tuesday in the new to the border &quot; &quot; Tran@@ se@@ ons &quot; &quot; of 94 trials , which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there were 40 refugees there .
&quot; practically , no one has a prospect for granted asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian views , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the distr@@ acted asylum seek@@ ers should be removed there .
before the &quot; transition zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there were only a few hundred refugees .
the workers began to rise in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they gathered the rub@@ b@@ ish one who left the ti@@ res@@ nia in the past weeks at the road@@ side .
pl@@ ywood were re@@ constructed and one of the recording @-@ camps in the bor@@ place was changed .
the aim of this re@@ building wanted to speak no one .
Austria are now reaching a few refugees after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 migrants kept up to government claims but still in the country . &quot;
in Salzburg about 1400 people around the world are waiting for Germany .
the transport from there to Germany was stopped in the morning in order of the German authorities .
in Freil@@ ass@@ ing we met smaller groups of refugees on foot .

&quot; because England had surprisingly heavy due to the stream of rail transport with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee deal , it was offered in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; thus the town hall offering its assistance and the mess@@ engers together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the river Nahe Region . &quot;
&quot; before , we did not get the un@@ hop@@ ed guests once again , with al@@ lot of break and drinks . &quot;
we were immediately said to get them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; it was a matter of course for us , &quot; thus the City of O@@ Ö@@ N . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let him take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; this was very excited for us , &quot;
&quot; the passengers who had passed away from the ICE in Wels from a ICE in a regional train in the direction of Pass@@ au , to follow it after the short notice that the traffic @-@ traffic to Germany was still un@@ postpon@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the regional train , however , was placed in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn . &quot;
in W@@ ern@@ stein is the cross @-@ border generally high in the course .
the bridge @-@ firm association with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ able ; previously a two @-@ day for@@ ged spor@@ ty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; now Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent further Z@@ ig@@ nia , is an logical result of an apparent policy : &quot;
&quot; rather than in the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , rather in the construction of structures to help humanity , our Chancellor continued to state our Chancellor , officially , and publicly expressed the position of the Hungarian government in the district of the Nazi regime . &quot;
suffering from this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now facing the bor@@ derland with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; the whis@@ per@@ ation have to discover that the &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcomed nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a major challenge , given the continuing wave of refugees and the hiber@@ nation , with decent conditions for seeking asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria will be retained . &quot;
Konrad in Search of 35.@@ 000 hiber@@ nation quar@@ ry
Konrad has filled all hands with the refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to have his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ Ban@@ ker to raise the refugees to the thousand refugees .
the chaos in the first @-@ thought centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already been gained in this grip .
&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of 20,000 refugees came on Monday to Austria , be done without great action , &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; master@@ ing . &quot; &quot;
the Department was stated in contrast from a &quot; cr@@ ite situation . &quot;
&quot; overall , Konrad with a need for 8@@ 5.000 quar@@ antine on the previous year . &quot;
&quot; to fulfill the number must be found in the next few weeks more than 35.@@ 000 accommodations - 20,000 to the countries provide , 15,000 in the Bund . &quot;
&quot; should it be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a bot@@ tom@@ less pit &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
with the governor he has already led talks .
&quot; these would have asser@@ ted him , as well , as for the coming refugees quot@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ österreich it runs well , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Car@@ dinal Christoph Scho@@ born , to be clari@@ fied , as the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; great expectations also of the asylum @-@ ordinator of the Asyl@@ um , also committed to the &quot; &quot; OR@@ F &quot; &quot; campaign as we do . &quot;
the platform can offer private people and accommodations .
&quot; furthermore , one hopes for hotels that will be empty during the winter . &quot;
Konrad and Ma@@ ier criti@@ ci@@ zed the standards for the accommodation as &apos; very high .
&quot; in emergen@@ cies , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ors must have to keep a certain amount of the hand @-@ cl@@ amping holder or size of the dark . &quot;
for a short @-@ term time &quot; st@@ akes &quot; apply .
&quot; he was successful in opposition to the office where she is successful , reveals Konrad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am a older gentl@@ eman , which you cannot put without further into the face the fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause costs as they explained themselves .
your employees want to increase it on three to four .
the own qu@@ arti@@ er@@ list has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container on Steph@@ an@@ splatz in office .
but there are obviously problems with the permit .
Linz calls for better division
&quot; first , there is not an opening of urban sports halls and other buildings like Tips @-@ Arena and design center for keeping refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not at the moment when people are able to support those concerned without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; however , for the emergency , other sites will be tested on their efficiency . &quot;
criticism of the division and division of the refugees among the state of the state .
also other districts must be made here .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) the State of Josef P@@ it@@ inger ( VP ) has led to the continued procedure in the refugee question .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer reas@@ sured that German borders are not sealed .
the continuing journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
&quot; however , there is now the appropriate border controls . &quot;
special trains with refugees after Germany will not give it any more .
and the guards would however be brought to Germany with regular journeys to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the other EU member states , he asked for increased solidarity in the refugee question . &quot;
&quot; that Austria is now also to in@@ spec@@ tions to its borders , is a logical consequence of the action of German . &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
the &quot; &quot; Neue &apos;s &quot; &quot; ship@@ yard &quot; &quot; at the Lin@@ zer Industrial Section is officially completed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building of the IT @-@ company S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meter ) is designed to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area . &quot;
&quot; in IT the smart minds are our raw material and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
it can imagine investing in Start@@ up companies of the New Werft ship@@ yard and later on which to mig@@ rate .
&quot; already from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - that the Nieder@@ haus@@ er offers some promises : &quot; the next r@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; € 1,@@ 7 million Euros was invested by S &amp; T in the plant today , 3 million Euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to a third of the city of Linz , the country Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building has been p@@ aired by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square meter area in the building are already rented for another 40 percent give it requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened a second deal in the Arctic
in the new shop Fur@@ la @-@ Hand@@ bags are the centre of attention .
&quot; actually , Jut@@ ta wanted to lie a dog bro@@ adly . &quot;
this project had to get the 49 @-@ year @-@ old In@@ hab@@ itation of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the pig@@ e@@ markt @-@ arc@@ ades and finally got to get some growth in the shape of another business location .
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ shop in front of the business , in which they sold under amongst others bags , suit@@ case , shoes and skill@@ ets , is now all around Dam@@ en@@ Do in the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 Euro to have . &quot;
larger bags and accessories are up to 500 Euro .
since yesterday the new shop is in use .
&quot; before , several weeks ago was changed . &quot;
&quot; but I have long over@@ looks if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; says wide . &quot;
&quot; decisive for the decision was among other things , that also the Fur@@ la producers who are in Bologna at home from the idea of a dedicated site , where only their hand@@ bags are sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the fur@@ ry in the Greater Linz that sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has even Italian roots . &quot;
your fashion interest has been wide laid by her mother in the cradle .
most of me have emerged when something is developing and I can show new trends at high prices .
why so some woman to make a sight to a beautiful hand@@ bag into intake is also possible to answer the house@@ wife not with last safety .
perhaps it is because of a beautiful bag of every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ makers from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place , whose inhabitants will be appointed . &quot;
this property links some also with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president wants . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always off for set @-@ up .
&quot; whether he is expressed a foreign @-@ enemy , journalists or knowledge in the international crisis policy - the applicant indicates the election campaign against the candidate for the US presidential system . &quot;
and cuts well off .
&quot; this is also registered in the &quot; &quot; äl@@ z@@ isches K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grandparents of the estate with millions of people come from . &quot;
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road .
some of the 1200 @-@ inhabitants place is related via -@@ zig sites with it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palatinate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the election mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turns a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do vill@@ agers think about his goal to become more powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that somehow we find that somehow exciting , but in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters a lot was not really impressed , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous offspring , which in addition to Tru@@ mp also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up @-@ family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mod@@ est@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly also be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
to the king of the hearts he has not brought it there .
&quot; indeed , respect for the performance of the family , but also falling to the opinion that Tru@@ mp &quot; has already been a &apos; l@@ oud@@ mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ ded the nickname of the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the district , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ makers &quot; &quot; - to sky@@ scrapers : the car@@ penter , says they . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is thus found out of the village of the N@@ ero .
&quot; the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather immig@@ rant and in the USA opened a restaurant for the min@@ er . &quot;
corner@@ stone of the property group were first property sales in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grandparents was not free of Trag@@ ics : her desire to return to his time in his homeland , moved to the Bav@@ arian State , to whom the Palatinate belonged to the back then . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp , because he was once without a permit , the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ian History and People , Roland Paul , to the film start . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
it is in contrast to the agreements made by the descendants .
&quot; who had repeatedly talked about the import of Mexican immigrants in the United States , and called the construction of a border wall to desc@@ end illegal immigrants . &quot;
&quot; just as the pol@@ arity , that is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant kin@@ dre@@ d ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the op@@ a was born @-@ born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
the winem@@ akers in retirement sees the American rather dist@@ ancing itself &quot; he is always so tidy .
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; this can &apos;t be imagined , &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; land@@ lady Mas@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm mentioned like man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a post of the Heinz with a visit was something for the church organ , which is generally well anch@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; this can &apos;t be imagined from the Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they are better , if he did not want the choice , for &quot; he has such radical views , I do not know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had been the days at the time of his grandfather in the USA , had been like he , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more exciting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Kr@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not it , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; the grapes are mature without the President &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ dle Film , for the Tru@@ mp have long inter@@ viewed , have seen 12 000 kin@@ og@@ gles , also in the US the interest . &quot;

&quot; Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son came to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the liber@@ als of the Liber@@ als , but it has provided no great deport@@ ations to the reviews for today . &quot;
&quot; the show show of N@@ ine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the Federal Capital , as Mal@@ col@@ m &apos;s rotation , the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t . &quot;
&quot; the Riv@@ ale Sun@@ rise , with the anim@@ ators David Koch and Saman@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ Days , previously served in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television transmis@@ sions , to which also Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un . &quot;
&quot; this down@@ side of the resistance seemed to play no role for Australian TV @-@ viewers , since Sun@@ rise showed an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers in the five capitals , in comparison to today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today , an easy increase in relation to the rating of Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number was behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today in the last few months Today has closed the gap to sunrise .
&quot; in August today , today won an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 3@@ 30.000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 4@@ 0.000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; so far in September Sun@@ rise stands at an average of 34@@ 9.@@ 000 viewers to 3@@ 14.@@ 000 at Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happened every morning .
the winds of change are concerned these hours more than the Parliament .

&quot; the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man , but whom will he choose ? &quot;
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may obviously have ignor@@ ant who The Bachelor wins . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor &apos;s degree , has become the biggest secret . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not award whether she is the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before from three two , you may then acci@@ dentally give an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood continues to hold its lips until the final on Thursday .
&quot; all three women have om@@ itted on a ly@@ rical way , why wood is the perfect man and stressed his sense of hum@@ our , honest@@ y , family values and positive attitude towards reasons why she would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is put , &quot; If not you , who should get the last rose ? &quot; you might win their answers to the player , who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki inter@@ c@@ anned both fast , except itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood . &quot;
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one to one another .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sar@@ Allah ) and Sam@@ s energies are noticed because I felt it were quite compatible and I thought it was in the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with it , &quot; she added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen it together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel pleasant and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood is well suited as a couple .
&quot; from their point of view M@@ ack@@ ay said that the number of visitors a last week did her clear that wood &quot; &quot; could be &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ folded to him &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked , whom wood should vote , if not her , there she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say this , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girl alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
&quot; the Bachelor is on Wednesday , 19 : 30 hrs . , on Ten : &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ de Hay@@ ne had several options to start their N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his rel@@ ocation to the USA - and there were many other teams sent to their impressive open training day at the end of last year .
&quot; but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula , and it looks like a smart decision . &quot;
&quot; some coach would have run by Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank as he lost a k@@ angel , as it was the Aussie Rug@@ by League con@@ t at its first P@@ unt Return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota . &quot;
&quot; but Tom@@ s@@ ula sent his husband and gave the next chance to a p@@ unt return , and also to the ongoing game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula is still shown his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team encouraged by the grin@@ ding mill they encouraged them .
&quot; Tom@@ s@@ ula , Hay@@ ne was publicly known in his press conference after the game . &quot;
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who ri@@ et him to forget his place @-@ about catch , and to take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ de Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t with a st@@ unt , which was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings . &quot;
&quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ori@@ ent for his N@@ FL debut . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ ne left after the F@@ um@@ ble cur@@ ch@@ end the playing field and told later the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not imagine a bad start to his N@@ FL career , &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne caught the car@@ se@@ ater with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 in 2007 when a passport led at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area into a Tr@@ y for Queensland .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

the Austrian @-@ day @-@ operation of the Free voters t@@ aps up to Friday in the non @-@ fran@@ con@@ ian municipality .
actually all other main topics were intended .
but the record of the refugees also domin@@ ates the free voters meetings .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum is called &quot; &quot; Klau@@ sur &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ anger . &quot;
Ai@@ we@@ ep called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria in the way it existed during the Yugoslavia &apos;s wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; so we do not go on , we must lead to the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free voters &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the asylum seek@@ ers do not want to de@@ port the free voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; Ai@@ we@@ anger also demanded more staff for the administration who are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ we@@ anger . &quot;
the F@@ W head criti@@ ci@@ zed that several states are not consistently called : &quot; we bro@@ ws nation@@ wide uniform standards of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; Bavaria hi@@ ves off , others do not . &quot;
&quot; here , we have to be able to act . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional policy should not fall into the table under the table . &quot;

but that is not far enough .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W manager . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all the gymn@@ asi@@ ums that want .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen were shooting on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal shoot .
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after the police officers in a crowd , demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out in the district of R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , Chief District Apostle , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , with some of them stones and fire bom@@ bs . &quot;
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police have used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then shot up into the air before it returns on rubber @-@ fin .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were wounded , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber bands used , which is known to kill , but that they are traditionally used as less deadly alternative to produce such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the examination was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nepal than southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ adh@@ esi say that new provinces come in the framework of the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in Western Nepal by the ethnic group of the E@@ arus which want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been operating in violent disputes since the 10th century . &quot;
&quot; August killed , as the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal which has been central for centuries . &quot;

Em@@ den - The town of Em@@ den wants to market a roughly 4000 square meters of land in direct proximity to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently running .
&quot; the area is planned to use the grounds for a mix of trade , commercial and living . &quot;
&quot; if you look for appropriate offers , it is on the part of the city . &quot;
which investor to ask is not yet clear .

&quot; in addition , he fears like several other project cri@@ tic that would increase the traffic through the intended size of the plant : &quot; there are all bus lad@@ ders , so that this counts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens on the well one hect@@ are big area of the former host houses is still open .
there is no operator .

Google starts re@@ dou@@ bling donations to raise 11 million US $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ don@@ ating campaign that will help thousands of refugees seeking thousands of refugees , since the European nations are overwhel@@ med by the war , torn as they escape from war and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an unusual personal approach in promoting the donations of donations in his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google Doc@@ ter , who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old with her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; to our journey included many dark trains and bus trips , as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis grew in Europe , many people like my family are des@@ perate after help . &quot;
&quot; donations will attend four non @-@ profit organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , international Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Google said that the first global earned donations to a value of 5.4 million in googl@@ e.com / el@@ ong@@ ated to 11 million $ doubles . &quot;
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;

&quot; weight , weight loss may be helpful for slightly overweight di@@ abe@@ tics . &quot;
advantages of weight loss treatment for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last after a new study at least five years .
&quot; it is still too early to tell if slightly overweight people with diabetes after the weight loss treatment live longer than those that have non @-@ surgical treatments . &quot;
&quot; the mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote a leading article to the new study in J@@ ama Sur@@ gery . &quot;
weight@@ loss @-@ loss of surgical operations or obesity use various methods to red@@ res@@ ize the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absor@@ b food .
&quot; over the years , obesity has proven to be efficient for treatment of type 2 @-@ diabetes as efficiently , but most studies have been carried out in people with a body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain level of weight in relation to size , is regarded as normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that anyone is obes@@ e and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ gov / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital dates , which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity and gast@@ ric radi@@ al surgery - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people which were easily overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I , among those who under@@ went this operation , declined from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I was with those who do not have @-@ surgical treatments received approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; in those who under@@ went a surgical procedure , proceeds from 36 % the diabetes condition is totally and at 28 % . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes is completely generated only by one percent and in some with only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were found in controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol . &quot; in general , the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; researchers also monitoring the patient @-@ blood levels by hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood@@ stream over time . &quot;
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best viewed by 7 percent in writing .
&quot; after the surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level rose by about 9 percent to about 6 percent . &quot;
but the medical therapy group has remained stable at about 8 percent .
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as is reflected in the improved boom in A@@ 1@@ c level - reduced not the mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team provides the average results in the two types of the surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater returns on BM@@ I ( 7.3 % vs. 2.3 ) and hem@@ ost@@ als rather a complete overthrow of the Diabetes ( 46,@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence of a study of serious people in Sweden that surgery lead to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was subjected to obes@@ e people , who under@@ gone up to an obesity operation , roughly 29 per cent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group , the conventional methods tried . &quot;
&quot; although the new study has no advantage for survival in surgery @-@ patients , Black@@ stone , it is so@@ othing for individuals with a BM@@ I among 35 who are interested in the proceedings . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without the increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously once the patient lies with its BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we are waiting too long , until we take people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they accum@@ ulate these genetic changes , which have linked their body with obesity and diabetes , is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot;
love plays in H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
&quot; it is an issue that is being multip@@ lied in the times of fiction : a young woman , too popular and un@@ sight@@ ly , meets the shame of her youth after years and he loved it in her . &quot;
thus also in the recently @-@ created novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not that &quot; by Luisa bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück readers because it plays in bore and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the full @-@ time writer has grown up in bore and is pleased that she was able to spot a liter@@ ary monument .
&quot; it is impossible that everybody can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe can not absor@@ b all refugees , the Dalai Lama promised and added that the real solution of refugee crisis in the Middle East continued . &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leaders called for it to stop violence in the homeless people .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his 10 @-@ day visits in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford with ethics .
he claimed that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed against the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also pointed out that the reaction of the West European countries to the refugee crisis is worth its admir@@ able , but the situation is not reasonable . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everybody can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts at dealing with the crisis , he emphas@@ ised that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , is wonderful , but in the meantime you must think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
ultimately we need to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of force never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised to the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and turned out that the violent response from the US drew from un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; I have expressed my p@@ ity in a letter to President Bush on September 11 , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know , his motives were good , but he put violence and this has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
quad@@ ru@@ ary increase in intake of hand@@ san@@ iti@@ zer by children over the past 4 years
&quot; avi@@ our control centers in the United States report on an almost 400 % increase in the number of children under 12 years , including strongly alcoholic beverage funds , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , came the cases of revenues of hand @-@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years that report po@@ ison control centers , from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are coming more frequently to these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them go in the note , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant , while some are doing it to make their friends impress or because of a mut@@ ation in social media . &quot;
&quot; videos on YouTube show how young people of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants are just to drink , because of a cheap adventure . &quot;
young people have alleg@@ edly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with non @-@ alcoholic m@@ outh@@ wash to receive a tough@@ er drink .
younger children can be j@@ acked up by attractive sc@@ ents of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the attractions ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ ected .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and or@@ anges , which are very appealing for children . &quot;
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol .
particularly in small children can already lead a few sp@@ lash for alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the University of K@@ ansas , the Sender Fox and 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not let be@@ aten whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and if children come about it , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , which had recently taken four sp@@ lash of straw@@ berry after straw@@ berry com@@ for@@ ging instruments at school was taken into a emergency treatment . &quot;
&quot; your blood @-@ concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is referred to as required in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated them at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ends her words and was not able to walk , when they arrived in an emergency . &quot;
&quot; doctors super@@ vised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital with signs of mill@@ et trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had head to the head , &quot; &quot; Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; this was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; said Or@@ tor@@ ia Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has parents and teachers recommended to use non @-@ alcoholic products or inf@@ ect@@ ant and risk san@@ iti@@ zer outside the child &apos;s reach .
beyond alcohol poison@@ ing were also related to some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with deaths .
&quot; in 2013 two women in Ontario were killed in Ontario women after s@@ acks of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which were a tox@@ ic@@ able ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities assume that the product meth@@ anol contained , that the product meth@@ anol contained , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ yl@@ al@@ ko@@ hol , who was noted as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January there were three students from the fourth class in the State New York , their &quot; ma@@ stered &quot; teacher trained by placing bacterial products round the classroom , &quot; said a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to a de@@ mic inf@@ ect@@ ant and ex@@ iles it out of their space .
the police considered the ver@@ tex plan as &quot; bet@@ g@@ tz &quot; and the trans@@ discipl@@ in@@ arity measure to the school authority .
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; during a return fall on the cross@@ bar between Nordr@@ ing and In Her@@ ones , a few @-@ year @-@ old motor@@ ists have been easily viol@@ ated . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think that the players look forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in the Scottish football te@@ di@@ bor@@ ed Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former nation@@ alist of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er has said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic because there is no sign @-@ ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; Bo@@ er , currently a mess@@ enger for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland she show no highlights in the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk not just about the return of the R@@ angers .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they speak about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
I will turn things around and cri@@ ed D@@ ei@@ la .
&quot; Ronn@@ y D@@ ei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight for , but the Norwegian chief s@@ or to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat on Malmö and the following depart@@ ing from the Champions League followed the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ de@@ en , who now stand clearly at the top of the table with five points . &quot;
&quot; but D@@ ei@@ la said , &quot; Celtic had already been bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel that exactly - but we have to go .
we really need to really get the support from Celtic because that makes the player better .
up to now is so important .

the ex @-@ head of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January @-@ Transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the United Kingdom .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained in the period May to July unchanged at 16@@ 4.000 , whereas the number of people without work for the UK as a whole period rose by more than 10,000 million . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s work rate of 5.5 percent came across the U@@ CS of 5.5 per cent , such as the figures of the Office for National Statisti@@ cs ( ons ) . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the activity in Scotland was 12@@ ,000 for the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
the employment rate for Scotland was in the course of the quarter at 7@@ 4.3 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
the Permanent Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ el commented the latest figures and said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has placed the corner@@ stone for a stronger economy . &quot;
it &apos;s almost a year that Scotland has taken the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish job market with an increase in employment and decrease in unemployment .

&quot; the invitation was already made in January about its best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day came closer , I started to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see in the United States , and as often more applications are available as places available , there is a mak@@ eover lot@@ tery in order to decide which is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
&quot; who is chosen , who will watch it emoti@@ ve . &quot;
I cannot do that .
&quot; I &apos;ll be sitting in the narro@@ west friend beside Richard gl@@ si@@ ps , whom I developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often lau@@ gh a lot when we talk .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be permitted to take a not@@ ebook and take part to take up what I see . &quot;
I have to simply try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot;
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the prison@@ er , as he wants , and you will receive access . &quot;
I set me on her .
&quot; they dre@@ amed that they could &quot; would have better form@@ ulate , &quot; but they still think it is false , what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ sip had problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he does not tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it , even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
&quot; but he wants that an international re@@ por@@ ter is present , to write there . &quot;
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations is helping the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a writer of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts I made . &quot;
I will not go over here again in detail .
I can not say with security that Richard gl@@ sip is inno@@ cent .
his actions after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty to be a benefici@@ ary of action .
&quot; but I believe that a strong probability is found , that he is not guilty of the murder . &quot;
I think that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be truly objective .
there will be other re@@ por@@ ters that you can apply for this .
&quot; what you will receive from me , is what it says , a man to die an unnecessary death . &quot;
man after the mo@@ ist police mo@@ ist hunting animals to get from the C@@ anning River
the p@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman was dry even when he spoke the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt at a man of Per@@ th , who hang down the police was un@@ successful when he was in sei@@ zing and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters from a police demanded , who tried to over@@ ride it , to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was launched on Tuesday to a yard in B@@ ecken@@ ham .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them toward C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water - and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and take me , &quot; &quot; said Senior ge@@ ant Cast@@ l@@ ed@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; stable Sal@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about doing his Uni@@ form , therefore he turned to a reliable tactics - &quot; A good polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to escape , &quot; said Senior ge@@ ant Cast@@ l@@ ed@@ ine . &quot;

Peter Moody claims that ste@@ wards attempted to sp@@ y him and to end the racing sport
Peter Moody claimed that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria have tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables last year and dro@@ pping the race immediately .
&quot; he aimed on the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last stra@@ w that carried out on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moody said Fair@@ fax Media , that he is always trying to do what is best for racing sport and he found himself under difficult conditions , when he walked to the positive cob@@ alt @-@ Tup@@ id at Li@@ dar@@ is which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age alleg@@ ations , and did not want to see it &quot; &quot; see how too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had to say nothing about it and I have long before dinner , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything coming out again &quot; said Moody . &quot;
they know that it continues .
&quot; it is sometimes respon@@ sive and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to go up@@ t , and I want my owners think I try my best for her . &quot;
&quot; when they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be more trainers . &quot;
I need to think of what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moody the bom@@ b had used the bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the quality management department had tried to sp@@ y his stable . &quot;
&quot; in eight@@ een months ago , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart in a room with a man - I will design@@ ate when I will ask - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables for information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moody on rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they obviously believe that I am a sc@@ amm@@ ers .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly believe in its n@@ oses , because they have failed to grip me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Roul@@ ston , here . Chairman of the RU@@ L , David Moo@@ y , the founder President of the RU@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , present CEO of the RV@@ L , were aware of this and are still today . &quot;
should I consider this to be that it is personally ?
has the RU@@ L beh@@ aved himself and perhaps people outside of trainers are responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and come across me , and I have no doubt that what I say , she is now thinking about it . &quot;
&quot; now I arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t care , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
I will exercise the pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the Fru@@ ity levels of the trainer were constructed on the long @-@ lasting Kob@@ alt @-@ examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to that he said he &quot; &quot; could throw his license on the table . &quot;
&quot; Moody , best known by his preparation for Black C@@ avi@@ ar , the racing car treatment rule marked &quot; ridicul@@ ous , &quot; after a pack@@ ing@@ shot or sound had been applied to the horse , what came against the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has found ir@@ r@@ dly mistak@@ enly mud on the leg .
it would have been like that evening .
&quot; it could have been the whole day yesterday , what was so . &quot;
it had it also like that on the race day .
Moody may be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack of the race day . an investigation of this issue has been opened .
it is a joke .
&quot; people who face these rules , do not know anything about the horse . &quot;
&quot; we all see one that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; said Moody . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Stor@@ m @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy defe@@ ats against Riv@@ als for alleg@@ ations of Ring@@ ings
Melbourne @-@ Stor@@ m @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy is cri@@ tique of the Tac@@ tical of his players as an &quot; Agenda S@@ etting &quot; from the two Premier League of the NR@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee won the Stor@@ m players &quot; ring support &quot; with his team during the high Stor@@ m winners in the qualifying &apos;s finale in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Ben@@ nett made a hardly disgu@@ ised note to the Stor@@ m team , after his team won the Final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boy on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample book &quot; of Rug@@ by League and said that the two Queensland won &apos;t be &quot; good &quot; in the crack . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said they were concentr@@ ating only on their &quot; &quot; contact &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading coaches in his team make him confident , as it be@@ de@@ dly that they were worried that they were worried by the Stor@@ m team . &quot;
&quot; that emerg@@ es again and again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about Ring@@ fights &quot; , &quot; she said to us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can guarantee that nothing has changed in our broken system or techniques all year long . but over the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es a real focus . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he therefore is probably not used to get used to losing , so it was a bit of shock for him . &quot;
&quot; it is funny , as this happens over and over again at this time of year . &quot;
Bell@@ amy got Ben@@ ef@@ ts &apos;s idea from &quot; exciting football &quot; and his ment@@ or reminds that Ben@@ ef@@ ts St George Ill@@ awar@@ ra Dragons the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he was compared his play on Saturday evening with our on Friday evening and how exciting their play was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was criti@@ ci@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a she@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team who can play this and which we as exciting , especially his young players at their speed . &quot;
this is the bal@@ loon game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as they play . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger trust because they say these things , because they are a bit worried to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago she probably didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game of Stor@@ m against ro@@ sters obtained a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the bron@@ cos was a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts at our game but is it an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks ? do not make any points a wing@@ span ?
for me it is the plans .
&quot; when they mention , it means that we will be meeting on them in a phase . &quot;
&quot; the Stor@@ m team has arrived at this weekend since they have won the right to accom@@ o@@ date either North Queensland Cow@@ boy or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night in the Sem@@ i Park next morning . ticket sales starts starting tomorrow morning . &quot;
&quot; Ser@@ b with 200@@ .000 $ deposit , according to drug application &quot;
&quot; a guy who could potentially face a life @-@ long punishment because of its temp@@ ting to come into the possession of 40 kil@@ ograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that were placed by Queensland , was released against a deposit of 200,000 $ . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the police police took 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America over V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina in the mid@@ day and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ adh@@ ouse , where the police took 40 kil@@ ograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite an potentially li@@ vable punishment for an attempt to own a commercial set of co@@ ca@@ vi@@ vic , there would be no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café has been of a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter F@@ agan , was worried about the danger of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he stated the court on Wednesday . &quot;
in the war@@ matter the police led the police on his place of residence .
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and Sti@@ ef@@ father had a deposit of 200,000 dollars as safety together to achieve its release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the basic explanations of the two persons , it is clear that the issue of a security of 200,000 accounts is a real financial burden &quot; &quot; said judge fl@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from , but he burned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against deposit , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Serbian pass , who announces his Australian and himself on a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

&quot; H@@ og@@ g then pointed out to the officials that he would have done it , since it would lead to &quot; pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ ile in the internet , &quot; and he then presented a polic@@ eman in order to sc@@ ares them . &quot;
&quot; the government Ombud@@ sper@@ son E@@ ili@@ dh Robert@@ son told the Dun@@ de@@ e Sher@@ i@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addiction that he was addi@@ ctive , to sc@@ are people . &quot;

he asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the images and he asked to send more photos .
he said that he did it to l@@ ure them .
&quot; he said he is sick on his head , when he dro@@ wns , and he said , he wants to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Robert@@ son added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the tre@@ m@@ bling and crying . &quot;

on Friday there is no longer a look at the sun .
the mass does it : every two years show the high@@ ways on the I@@ AA to their innovations .
2015 is primarily a movement for the compact cars which are currently on sale especially well .
&quot; cars from the compact class are currently in demand at present : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of new registr@@ ations , they fell according to power lines ( KBA ) alone in August this segment . &quot;
this is reflected in the I@@ AA ( General Public Days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; in this year , between all the futur@@ istic conceptual design and new luxury cars and luxury cars will be presented for many new compact models this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premium for the German auto industry is the Opel Astr@@ a , which will be in the fall at the dealers . &quot;
&quot; Astr@@ a is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel &apos;s CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann in the exhibition . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; thus , the volume of volume is also well sold , the new Astr@@ a is also not being much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel represents an entry below the largest competi@@ tor VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
&quot; the current Astr@@ a costs starting from 16 9,@@ 990 . &quot;
&quot; with a new 1,@@ 4 @-@ l@@ iter engine with 74 kW / 100 HP . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the Hessen more diesel and gas@@ oline engines offer from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 b@@ hp to which for the first time also three cylin@@ ders . &quot;
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus there is the Opel Astr@@ a initially only as five @-@ fifth .
&quot; the second variant will follow the spring of the comb@@ i , which is also already seen at the I@@ AA . &quot;
and what is going on in addition to the Astr@@ a at the I@@ AA remaining on new fabric cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astr@@ a ri@@ val Mé@@ gan@@ e in the race .
on the fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only more than five @-@ fifth in a conventional and highly qualified sporting complex .
&quot; at the start of trade he comes to trade at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : very new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan Win@@ ner wants to find its position in the strong growing segment with the new model .
&quot; in addition , the compact Infin@@ iti is suitable for its s@@ inu@@ ous forms fully into the design line of the brand . &quot;
the base model will get a gas@@ oline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
in offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 HP or 125 kW / 170 HP .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno that celeb@@ rates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model with gas@@ oline engines , including a newly developed 1,0 @-@ l @-@ Tur@@ bom@@ ot@@ or , and an output of 82 kW / 111 HP . &quot;
the maximum torque is by manufactur@@ er@@ ans from 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe will be launched in spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model 4 , that is on the I@@ AA . &quot;
&quot; outside , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Abl@@ eg@@ ers laid hands on the front @-@ part in particular : here the cooler was re@@ marked and the changed spot@@ lights with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the inner space , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ant system has been moderni@@ zed , reduced the number of buttons via a touch@@ screen and the first Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play is being integrated . &quot;
&quot; in addition , on the I@@ AA in the compact class , a number of covers and new variants , such as the re@@ tool@@ ed Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ T@@ egel : five square metres cells are humane
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ prison@@ er of the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , which has been accommod@@ ated monthly in a small cell . &quot;
&quot; because of violations of their human rights , in@@ mates are fundamentally eligible for financial compensation if they are placed into small cells . &quot;
this has the Federal Constitutional Court in any of the Wednesday &apos;s decision .
sufferers may even hope for the judges even if only a few days were imprison@@ ed in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
&quot; that was an explosion @-@ prison@@ er with his constitutional referendum in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell Berlin @-@ T@@ egel in Berlin between June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five square meter floor ; the toilet was spatial , not sealed off . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who is now on the right foot , has been moved to a larger cell . &quot;
his crimes against the state of Berlin fails due to un@@ worthy liability conditions .
but the ruling fun@@ nel sw@@ ans the judgment of the Kam@@ mer@@ ger@@ ts in Berlin and sent the case to the renewed examination .
you see the man &apos;s men in@@ ju@@ red .
Chamber of Ap@@ pe@@ als now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if legal reasons of the frag@@ rant period just a few days of liability for the compensation may be decisive , be an ou@@ tru@@ er , was called it . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , it would be a dimin@@ ishing of the legal protection of the personality . &quot;
the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ als must now clear the amount of a dis@@ ser@@ tation .
the ruling class has often strengthened the rights of criminal prisoners in the past .
&quot; in April , they spoke to in@@ mate for in@@ dem@@ nity , because it was naked in a cell . &quot;
human @-@ worthy is one of the decisions of 2011 also the multi @-@ occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet .
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitutional Court , where a prison@@ er had reached an un@@ decent accommodation in November 2009 . &quot;
the dam@@ aging Kl@@ äger was aged between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell like in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pr@@ isons have come into the head@@ lines in recent weeks because of missing ones .
&quot; prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggressi@@ vity is increasing , even to but@@ chers it is supposed to have been due to the tense situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the judiciary , 21 places in T@@ egel because of the young@@ sters are not occupied , 19 shall drop off . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs this year , according to the statement by vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to absor@@ b a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated with resolve the unusual challenges : &quot; I am saying again and again : we can create that and we create it . &quot;
&quot; finally , what is coming to Germany gives the following overview . &quot;
&quot; are needed according to different forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Companies ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments every year , while the next five years will continue . &quot;
&quot; this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) . &quot;
&quot; dramatic , the lack of living space , but above all in paid renting object : annually fall 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing out of rent balance , and to apply these particularly favourable homes as well as refugees . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister for Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the promotion , from currently 518 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing per year would have to do , and for this , the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.5 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; however , scientists and Bundes@@ minist@@ ries agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in residential construction . &quot;
&quot; according to the Institute for labour market research and vocational research , 55 percent of the refugees who have en@@ su@@ aded in Germany long term is 55 percent of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany were not at all been systematically asked about their qualification to help them start the work , critic@@ ised by Claudia Walter , project man@@ ag@@ ger for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , it is crucial whether they find work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the civil society , but also for the self esteem of the listen@@ er , says Mig@@ rations , Diet@@ rich Thr@@ aci@@ an . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , it has given a political transition to Thr@@ aci@@ hardt : there has been a political change of refugees on recognition of labour . &quot;
&quot; during the earlier a working committee offered for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residen@@ cy light that asylum seek@@ ers to a residence . &quot;
in society - also because of the lack of qualified labour - mostly the view is asser@@ ted that refugees should be able to allow refugees crossing the labour market .
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are a lack of interpretation .
&quot; until now , there is still no adequate offer of general and CP@@ D language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs most commonly through personal contacts .
the creation of networks is therefore based on Thr@@ aci@@ hardt of the long@@ itu@@ dinal path on labour integration .
&quot; Berlin school administration has established that only a few refugees stop their children in the Kit@@ ts , estimated at ten to 15 percent , &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sch@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family from the advantages of the cas@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand @-@ list in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators would rise strongly due to the great number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for example , allowing more specialized schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students are prepared for classes without a German and welcome classes . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teacher and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also of teaching staff who only have one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; in them there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate St@@ ats from Berlin educational administration . &quot;
German Student@@ en@@ werk is estimated that around 20 percent of refugees aim to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no state asylum seek@@ ers or do not toler@@ ate the study - the only exception was Berlin , In@@ sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enk@@ el ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its stance . &quot;
unlimited refugees could be facilit@@ ated to the university .
&quot; as refugees with a residence permit or ul@@ c@@ ination , no services are received after the asylum seek@@ ers of Act more when they start a degree . &quot;
&quot; the latter , in principle , will not receive a BA@@ Fö@@ G since they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ firms . &quot;
&quot; refugees have to have lived in Germany for four years so far , to be entitled to BA@@ Fö@@ G and to shor@@ ten this gap to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this kind of financing should be closed , call Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Under@@ secretary for Science , and the German Student@@ en@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; Islam will in future play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims and the religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should follow the same rights for Islam as the churches have , and the existing state churches and churches to develop a new state of religion . &quot;
&quot; it would also be important to the founding of a Muslim @-@ organization association , who professionally take care of the di@@ mm@@ ers . &quot;
on the rights are obligations .
&quot; in this way , representatives of Islam must agree on clear and willing to work with the state in many areas and give him certain controls . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the readiness to act against religious fundament@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed on Thursday the concern of religious conflicts may also be entered into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to carry such conflicts in Germany have immediately got their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; said , &quot; said he in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arab .
integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society in future .
&quot; this will also have to change the majority @-@ society , the dismant@@ ling of discrimination and racism will also have to prevail . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - since a scar@@ ce decade of anti @-@ discrimination and a general gender equality law .
&quot; but it was slow to learn how the NS@@ U series , the police and authorities re@@ ign@@ ited the rac@@ ist motive systematically . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants and stakeholders are looking for a long time , and why international treaties such as anti @-@ rac@@ ist prevention of Germany must become reality in the coming years , when the country will remain peaceful and use its new citizens - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany has been able to supply the anticipated refugees by medical , says Her@@ tz@@ t@@ ep@@ en President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for Man@@ - Power and Cap@@ acity , we are creating that , &quot; &quot; said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be possible to flow extra money into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all off@@ cuts are equal to the registration of health cards . &quot;
it services could be completed later by the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; and in the long run it is highly question@@ able , so many people send to the limited service catalog , which means the asylum seek@@ ers of asylum . &quot;
otherwise make doctors first of all the language barriers .
&quot; even so far , the Berlin Government Sciences The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven to be more uns@@ ol@@ ved of their disease than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical doctors would have to be taken over transl@@ jo@@ vice , calls them . &quot;
&quot; it would be helped with many refugees , but even with more general health care than in the emergency . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
under refugee camp about there is clearly more untreated disabilities and among the young people there is about HIV education .
&quot; with the sometimes other medical doctors , German doctors came from their training but realized , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ites or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not as difficult to recognize . and what affects the lack of neg@@ ation , be of the refugees possibly even reli@@ eving in sight . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans would have a advanced training system , many refugees even are doctors . &quot;
&quot; to practice it , however , they would need to demonstrate their qualifications and possibly put tests again . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees quot@@ ing in Germany is vit@@ ally ill , according to the estimates of the Bund@@ om@@ psych@@ otherap@@ y@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , most of them suffer from post@@ injury or depression . &quot;
&quot; particularly viol@@ ated , refugee sk@@ in@@ der , explains Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study of the Technical University of Munich occupies that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; who is suffering from a post traum@@ atic stress disorders , suffering from among other things , suffer from so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with respir@@ atory , pi@@ z@@ zin@@ ess , and deaths . &quot;
&quot; further symptoms are in@@ som@@ nia and concentration disorders , strong det@@ ain@@ fulness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms chron@@ ically would be , be an early treatment necessary , stated Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; to date , only four percent of the psych@@ ic cranes has given a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; while psychological asylum seek@@ ers can present an application for psych@@ otherapy , but it usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices mostly Sach@@ de@@ workers or doctors , who are not trained for the psychological conditions , whether treatment is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this lead frequently to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;

&quot; the goal is to draw any age group in the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
&quot; now , the cir@@ cus loads in the man@@ ege on the brick , was@@ en to dream . &quot;
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie , , Animal wiz@@ ard and jun@@ k . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this slogan is the current maneu@@ ver@@ aging . &quot;
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has proven in the hands of the family .
the gift to inspiration is thus the family in the blood .
&quot; it is important for us to take away the people from their everyday life , taking them for two hours to a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ eg@@ en@@ cock@@ tail with world @-@ air @-@ flair , &quot; says Reinhard Hey@@ st maintains its concept . &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair .
the program of the cir@@ cus is convinced with talented artists from around the world .
honoured at the international Circus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ ar@@ ov Clo@@ wn Family draws the audience with wit and charm in their spell . &quot;
and the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .

60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Steph@@ en@@ mother , Brigitte . &quot;
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus @-@ animals are only too often subject in various animal rights organisations .
&quot; Stephanie thanks also takes position : &quot; &quot; it does not apply our animals well , it is also not good . &quot;
some 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ legged Arti@@ sts &quot; , &quot; as they are lovingly called , the possibility of every wish is read from the eyes . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
does the animal doesn &apos;t feel comfortable there is also not want to lie into the ring .
the first commandment was excellent : good for the animals .
&quot; particularly at her z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ lan@@ Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a z@@ ebra @-@ mare , the family is prob@@ able . &quot;
the two animals spent eight years in a c@@ row and nothing is happening .
&quot; but then , suddenly our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; she said Brigitte . &quot;
&quot; although the z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id is not ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the cir@@ cus . &quot;
something for each visitor is likely to be part of it .

Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mug@@ abe performs a false discourse in the parliament
&quot; Mr Mug@@ abe , South Africa &apos;s premi@@ ered guide , came down from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he was in@@ ju@@ red , but the video of the case spread quickly over the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the Parliament was also aff@@ lic@@ ted by the members of the opposition that they had anonymous consecutive death and they were warned that by Mr Mug@@ abe , who were called Mr Mug@@ abe . &quot;
&quot; in the past month , they had f@@ ted him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven votes @-@ politicians have received SMS messages on their phones they warned Mr. Mug@@ ab@@ es .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; death &quot; , &quot; he said journalists to Mug@@ ab@@ es . &quot;
&quot; it war@@ ns the affected Parliament members that ends the immunity in the parliament and as soon as they leave the parliament , their parliamentary immunity are no longer effective . &quot;
Chief Executive Officer said that the Morgan T@@ sv@@ ang@@ ir@@ ai &apos;s party is &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for the politicians .
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build up to 30.000 work@@ stations
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the services of the company .
HP will be split up later this year into two listed companies and separate the computer and printers business of his fast growing company hardware and their service business activities .
&quot; the expected capacity of seating leads to a burden of more than $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will allow a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair and Chief Executive who are leading the unity of separation . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard , becomes smaller and stronger focused than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deeper portfolio of shops that help companies move into a new style of business , &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard Company has more than 50 billion $ annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing overall , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; as an explanation of the company . &quot;
&quot; it is a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s , from the gradu@@ ates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett @-@ Packard , and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Sili@@ con Valley &quot; . &quot; &quot;
HP has running a massive restructuring to tackle the returning from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure by HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC @-@ maker and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the conviction that closely focused companies can provide a better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ cap@@ tains Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team mates before the game against the Dynam@@ o Zagreb is standing behind the ver@@ end Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger pointed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was just September and provided his rehabilitation after plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas at Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario actually means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is certainly missing at least the next four games for England and given its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain . &quot;
&quot; the great shame associated with this current problem is that po@@ sh@@ ere finished the last season after a separate k@@ nu@@ ckl@@ ing , and then back again to his old momentum during the pres@@ eas@@ on . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatened by the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; it is a bone , not a cure . &quot;
it is not a major issue .
that was only an accident .
&quot; it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ckl@@ es , or with the injury that he had previously had . &quot;
&quot; this may be true from purely legal point of view , but like spiral also recognized , there is the per@@ tin@@ ent danger of other injury , whenever a player temp@@ ted to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it is also developing an uncomfortable pattern .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd was awarded 23 different disorders of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als and lig@@ ap@@ pers in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for arsen@@ al is that they have been ranked in six of eight players since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League Clubs .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil @-@ group , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the risk of injury during the last season will last . &quot;
&quot; sometimes if you come back from a breach , you have a temporary period , a time when you have to strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope that the body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will have a career run from the way he deser@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ track in the coming Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger marks up a rotation within the team . &quot;
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia that means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of After@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to hold the balance and to give players that need a small break @-@ off , &quot; &quot; said spir@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal are clear favor@@ ites , by group F to return , the Mak@@ si@@ mir &apos;s stadium in Zagreb is among the pitch with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is also dis@@ ma@@ yed after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was started in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake , taking place on the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3.@@ 2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League surrender against Monaco and remains of the far hope , with his management the association to lead the association to his first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked on arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were in 2006 very close to it , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show who gave us serious lessons of male @-@ friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is evident , especially in terms of how the need for men to open up , now even dou@@ bt@@ ful as ever before , as self @-@ murder among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the main desire for men at the age of 20 to 45 in the UK , and it is three times more pre@@ valent in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ein ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a her@@ edit@@ ary life ) 2015 than the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to ask help to seek help when they need it . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle for master@@ ing this challenge .
&quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms showed that when the suff@@ erer had enough high percentage of friends with a healthy mood , his chances of recovery . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spirit@@ ually healthy friends are the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course , one has only once friends to make a friendship . &quot;
&quot; in the age of more than social media , with its focus on style on substance is the in@@ ability of the answer more important than a significant contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have the need to be strong , life @-@ fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this ficial success is dominated by who domin@@ ates what psych@@ ologist extr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all on cost intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affect our mental health much deeper . &quot;
and as a video @-@ invent@@ or and milli@@ ard Bear recently stated that money can really not be bought .
the beauty of Friends was that this focuss@@ ing on the head has been put .
&quot; each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , who treats the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler @-@ h@@ ugs , moments of football in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men can refer to them , even though they can often return to explore completely their feelings . &quot;
&quot; like an employee of the telephone , I explained to me : ... &quot; my audi@@ ences for people who feel de@@ pressed and confident , has clearly demonstrated me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
men who contact us feel often unable to talk with friends .
&quot; the old expression &quot; &quot; I come down &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks about problems openly . &quot;
Friends is one of the shows that comes to my mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ic mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men @-@ friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status can help people in eye @-@ eyes of the air and also help the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Festival with which to celebrate the day completely newly designed scenes . why do not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
&quot; or , even better if you &apos;re sitting in Star@@ bu@@ ck &apos;s anybody alone , give him a smile and say hello . &quot;
one never knows what difference your friendship could make .

di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to zer@@ mal@@ ms
angel Di Maria celeb@@ rates the Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and the son Cav@@ ani after his hit to Hun@@ edo@@ ara .
&quot; di Maria at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps to go to PS@@ G to Hun@@ edo@@ ara . &quot;
here are the report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Bass@@ son Cav@@ ani kept on course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ ces park on Tuesday started .
&quot; tue made less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League de@@ gu@@ ts as PS@@ G player , who finished the French Masters along the road , but afterwards she finished a number of occasions when Cav@@ ani achieved a head @-@ fe@@ eder into the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Chess Federation Don@@ ez@@ k , also in group A needed Paris a strong start to the Swedish Master , since they not only seek the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ l@@ aps but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ finals in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a class@@ play by Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Zlat@@ ni I@@ bra@@ him@@ o@@ vic@@ s missed opportunities before the gate . he later became in the game against his home town team and against the club with which he began his illustr@@ ative career already in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to win 2 : 0 , even if there are certain things that we have to tag in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
we wanted to win and we won because I regret that we haven &apos;t achieved one or two more goals .
&quot; I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic was returning after his injury to one of three changes to the Paris Team , which was able to hold a 2 : 2 un@@ decided at their own place against Bordeaux in the first League , but he was met in the fourth minute through Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine @-@ wing@@ ed festival was known as the husband to take the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he ran in the last month by Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he ran at Johan Ver@@ per@@ tis Pass behind the Malmö . &quot;
&quot; but if any one believed that PS@@ G would have a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
Malmö , the Celtic in a Play @-@ off proposed to reach this level , entered in An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and ended with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle ground up a heavy opponent . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passing far off Kevin Tr@@ p P@@ fo@@ sten at 34@@ th minute , they offered little in attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes had on , with some de@@ mean@@ ings and poor l@@ ures , not least from I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , who was not less than five sellers alone on the first half of that and then abandoned after the re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he pointed out much more skill@@ ful when he brought his fellow @-@ players to the game and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , the Di Maria turned into a shooting , which was drawn from Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the p@@ fo@@ sten ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate was finally soon after the hour @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay Chess recorded its sixth end @-@ down , after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic was created a left side of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; the finished all thoughts that Malmö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could make the end result low before the Ez@@ ra Lav@@ e@@ zzi abandoned a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ley , gave later that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwegian said , &quot; our last Champions League was last December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have played only in the Swedish League that did not have the same level . &quot;
the quali@@ fiers are not sufficient . &quot;
hat from before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film created
Matt Dam@@ on meets the af@@ ro@@ American fil@@ mm@@ aker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she didn &apos;t need the scenes .
&quot; during a result of the Sunday night from H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , when this empha@@ sized the need for alternative perspectives , stres@@ sing in relation to a black prot@@ agonist in the selected screen@@ play of the project . &quot;
&quot; talk about diversity , then do it in the cast of the movie and not at the cast of the show , &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; wa@@ hoo ! Wow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the actor from The Mar@@ tian &apos;s paved . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on and Brown joined the Produ@@ c@@ ers of Ben Aff@@ li@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers in order to discuss the show@@ fin@@ alists with the show . &quot;
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - as they treat the figure of harmony , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a n@@ ut@@ te , that is be@@ aten by her white sugar . &quot;
&quot; the producer of De@@ ar White People picked up for the Fin@@ alist Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on re@@ gener@@ te that their director may give us something , what we do not want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media den@@ ies against dis@@ approval via Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter Mr Po@@ oni aff@@ lic@@ ted his anger about the clip that he wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that is SO MU@@ ISS , that it hur@@ ts me . &quot;
the twe@@ et used more than 5.000 Ret@@ ri@@ ets and 4,000 likes since its publication .
&quot; Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come to a time when the precise rac@@ ist representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion . &quot;
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the Movement achieved Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter land@@ es@@ u@@ ders and authorities , discrimin@@ atory practices and anti @-@ discrimin@@ atory practices . &quot;
in February the voc@@ alist Prince made a landing on the movement during the introduction of the nom@@ ini@@ zed albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; Alb@@ ums is silent , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; as books and black life , also albums are still their significance . &quot;
&quot; more recently , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter published an explanation and in response to the question of the Fox @-@ News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , if the group should be seen as a hat@@ red group . &quot;
&quot; the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love @-@ group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was found that Dam@@ on was found on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media @-@ gu@@ le , who will be invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;

&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; kr@@ ing@@ t First Champion
&quot; professional sports@@ wear and operator of Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero , became the first Ath@@ l@@ one , who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of 1 million . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which finished just their 7th season , had never experienced an competition entry that was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , to the final . &quot;
the last task belonged to climbing to a 75 feet long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; passed the task within the time , when he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete , who Warri@@ or completed the stren@@ uous phase 4 of the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him true . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero talked to E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock over the gain of the prize of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never deser@@ ved more than 10,000 $ or to life , &quot; &quot; Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
so very suddenly ... as I can not even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leader producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why B@@ ritten , though he did first at all , did not get any price @-@ money . &quot;
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; when there is more than one fin@@ alists , he gets one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
how much the money is a wonderful price and life changed he receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t believe he will have a gru@@ dge himself .
he has just done so happy to have done what he did .
he received the masses of awards by fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be@@ aten by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
&quot; and I think Isaac was just as felt , if it had changed the roles . &quot;
&quot; America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or was extended for one eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak by Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
formerly they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball ; today the Tig@@ ers are on the last seat at the American League Central .
the tigers are reduced to their role as a Spo@@ iler but played this part in the Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target Field .
the T@@ wins a chance for Ascension within a game half of Houston G@@ ros for the second American League of Wild@@ Card place .
&quot; Detroit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word which was so difficult to grasp more about a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Ex@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; Tiger @-@ pit@@ cher Al@@ fredo Simon held his early offensive support , as Detroit offered three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth time . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) suggested 6 times to the 1 / 3 inside and enabled three run@@ ners .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year greatly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw at the bull@@ fighting every game , and I want to concentrate entirely in the game . &quot;
the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three commen@@ ces and was in two R@@ us , his first R@@ BI@@ s since the middle of August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits to the Seattle mar@@ in@@ ers on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he has ra@@ ving the true wood , &quot; &quot; said lev@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at ( stroke training ) , saw clearly better off in the bull@@ fighting , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ us at the back at the end of the seventh day , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der Byr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left line of the line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks finished a m@@ unt and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier for Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy Hard rain , the only guy who was confronted with whom he was confronted with , before the qu@@ ig@@ ni@@ ated Rookie bu@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run Dre@@ w Ver@@ h@@ agen to a two @-@ run . &quot;
with a pair of run@@ ners and the finish @-@ run the second Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ cke to a Double Play .
it was the major league leading 27 times in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ps proposed a double Play .
&quot; after Detroit added an Insurance Run , the wall made a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and recorded the booth of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ handed sc@@ an@@ ach is S@@ ano on three Pit@@ ches for his 5th Save . &quot;
Detroit benef@@ ited for the opening of the game from one yet mo@@ ve@@ able Phil H@@ ugh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers obtained 3 R@@ uns in the first two inside against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been rep@@ ain@@ ted before the game from the viol@@ ability list after having been missing for a back yard more than a month ago .
&quot; obviously , not the beginning I wished for , &quot; said H@@ ugh@@ es , &quot; but I felt at ease , when I put and feel some pretty good Pit@@ ches could be done in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ bat@@ ter , Hus@@ k@@ ick@@ ed a single of Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought a title by Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman of Castell@@ anos followed by a single on the right , managed to run a further run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , what the threat ended . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers put in the 2nd to the One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not take place well , but he caught the right place . &quot;
H@@ ugh@@ es was found in a Pit@@ ch Count and had not scored points in the third inning before he was replaced by the rel@@ ic R@@ igh@@ thand@@ ed A.@@ J.@@ Ach@@ ter .
Mr H@@ ugh@@ es came to three hits and a walk with four k@@ ke@@ els .
note : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal S@@ án@@ chez is divided because of a violation of the wor@@ ri@@ ck@@ school .
he is studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ chez in 2007 .
&quot; S@@ án@@ chez , since mid @-@ August at the viol@@ ability of a shoulder @-@ rung , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris from the viol@@ ability list will launch against the T@@ wins . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July . &quot;
he was missing since the 20th August because of a crus@@ hing in the right hip .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games in target Field on Wednesday

Isch@@ ia : German military measures in Syria have an option
&quot; the head of the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Security conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for an opportunity . &quot;
&quot; I think the f@@ arewell thinking about military action may not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he thre@@ w the European states &quot; collective away . &quot;
four years ago I was happy that the Kel@@ ch had gone to Germany with a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict escal@@ ates in front of our front door , &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German amb@@ assador in Washington also called for a massive form of international aid to refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
&quot; according to Germany , Austria has again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Interior Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner stated on the evening of the Austrian television station OR@@ F , and finally no one will be returned to Hungary now . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even Germany did not return refugees to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , that is so agreed &quot; &quot; stated . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of an agreement that Germany could include a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , was a proper conversation between the Director @-@ Director for Public Safety and representatives in Germany . &quot;
concrete figures did not call it and dism@@ issed on talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees were brought to the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary to Austria . &quot;
your goal is mostly Germany .
ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit with several other EU leaders and governments a special summit for next week .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have so far not been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis .
&quot; the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take a new start on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special appeal for the binding distribution of more than 120,000 refugees . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the federal states with the first intake and distribution of the people . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation is going to com@@ end this together with the countries , Merkel announced the late afternoon after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the registr@@ ar in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ scored , those people who are concerned , be@@ ating this too . &quot;
but who has no perspective on who would not be able to stay in Germany too .
this idea was often divided in the round .
the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge force effort . &quot;
thousands of des@@ perate refugees are now stuck on the Bal@@ kan@@ route .
Hungary was closed its 175 kilometers long border with Serbia in the night .
&quot; a few hours later the government announced in Budapest , also the border to Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary would w@@ ool to prevent the tu@@ g of tractors over Romania , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new Grenz@@ au@@ n . &quot;
the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
there was first arrest of people that inter@@ c@@ utter the fence .

&quot; when you buy Mang@@ os not too soft or too firm , smell to cra@@ wl . &quot;
the shell@@ fish alone says nothing about how ri@@ pe the fruit is - so can also taste green man@@ goes very delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then they taste of course pure or in sweet food .
but there is also a man@@ go and a special touch .
it mil@@ der the slightly bitter taste of some leaf@@ lets such as Ch@@ ic@@ or@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .

on Wednesday and in the night for Thursday the hair @-@ cave was partly transferred to the tor@@ ch by the landlord .
&quot; after a res@@ trained on Thursday morning , a striking cold @-@ front crosses us that brings more vigor@@ ous ra@@ inf@@ alls , wind @-@ bu@@ sts and a temperature shift . &quot;
&quot; as Mete@@ o@@ News in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure area across the British islands in a powerful south @-@ west flow . &quot;
on the alpine @-@ north side the night comes back to Wednesday of the mountain by the valleys .

Rome has a Martin Lu@@ ther slot
nearly 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin Lu@@ ther square .
&quot; in the presence of Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , on Wednesday , a date of un@@ less place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was bap@@ tised in the name of the German re@@ equ@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; , &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologist of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the park is located in the middle of the old Rome , next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um . &quot;
the nam@@ ing was requested by the evangel@@ ical Chur@@ ches of the evangel@@ ical Chur@@ ches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lu@@ ther@@ an Church in Rome , rec@@ alled on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es , over centuries only could only live in secret their faith . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic manner , become visible that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is appreciated . &quot;
Martin Lu@@ ther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) found himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k round the annual turn 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city back then as a worthy sin@@ ner .
his negative impressions are likely to have buried him according to historians in his later struggle against Rome .

Hammer artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main works that has painted Red mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and updated text texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not with the Oth@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which now appeared with brilliant pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , the image for Ot@@ abo@@ o has been formulated in 150 moti@@ fs his very personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; images . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , adapted to the respective topics , it can be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; about three years Ot@@ mar has worked on his Bible project , for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; book of all books &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these cycles are emerging for cycles that are dedicated to topics like cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or f@@ ather@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; thus , he has immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to the Lu@@ ther publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with his emphasis on artificial books . &quot;
and there is mainly the author Klaus Alt@@ ost ost which is based on painting with the particular gen@@ ossen@@ a .
&quot; he interpreted the be@@ ad@@ es of Ot@@ mar Alt Cap@@ ture and so Today , he translated into current connections . &quot; &quot;
these texts are like remaining mirror of Al@@ ts Pain@@ ting .
immersed in the original Bible from Martin Lu@@ ther and a sentence by the artist who form@@ ulates his very personal thoughts of the respective situation here .
the jewelry designer has golden letters .
this allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old at double a deep insight into his soul and his emotions .
this is a great deal of intimacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately born at all trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ j@@ ani Old , 1940 born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant ruling classes . &quot;
&quot; so the education already happened by the tube , &quot; is reminded of Oth@@ mar old . &quot;
&quot; I tried to re@@ plen@@ ish this , to bring me back to the Lord Father too . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to help the art in fast @-@ moving time again to be more important : &quot; the perception of image worlds is co@@ ined today by Re@@ kl@@ ame , and which is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being pushed out .
artists have a different desire and wish to show things .
pictures have always something mysti@@ cal and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wishes to allow themselves the spect@@ ator into the pictures . let them discover , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the picture looks for his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost renewed on Tuesday in the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old @-@ Foundation , &quot; &quot; has always been &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art , &quot; &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I have not taken care to grasp the Bible completely , but that selected for him important , also mysterious themes . &quot;
&quot; this was not collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explained . &quot; &quot; was created a images in the Bible . &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler , from the Lu@@ ther publisher , this work will invite you to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for M@@ öh@@ ler , both the biblical language of love and responsibility . &quot;

start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
&quot; plans made , place , have been commissioned , serving Erd@@ hü@@ gel for a tour course : one year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn was again gone . &quot;
&quot; om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administr@@ ations were given for adjustment , especially in the inhabitants that the train does not want to toler@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; so hill de@@ ed , new place - now with formal planning and application for construction clearance . &quot;
the approval was possible in October I was able to communicate the first municipal council Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee .
&quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; then there should be a &quot; &quot; further commemor@@ ate &quot; &quot; work with the works at the former Hall@@ enb@@ ad . &quot;
DF@@ B intensified dedication to refugees
the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees to 2019 ; the Bundes@@ liga takes a clear sign in the weekend .
football is responding to the respon@@ sive situation in Germany and ass@@ ures its policy with the challenges of tackling the upcoming problems .
&quot; I consider this the greatest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification .
&quot; then in principle nobody can say , this does not affect me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be interested in learning this topic on this subject , &quot; &quot; explains DF@@ B &apos;s CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he would like to intensi@@ fy the refugee situation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; I am the sign of the ch@@ anc@@ ellor and faithful , there the State Department of Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; as the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could and would like to w@@ ool it .
but the crucial key must provide the policy .
&quot; the German Bundes@@ liga must therefore extend its wave @-@ initiative &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot;
&quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
also some states support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ eine is putting a clear sign when they take place on the left tri@@ kot@@ cian instead of the usual sponsor@@ ing logos , taking place of the usual sponsor@@ ing logos ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot;
&quot; we also want to make clear that everyone should help , where and how you can only , &quot; &quot; Lever@@ k@@ ens Sport@@ manager Ru@@ di V@@ ö@@ ller the &quot; &quot; picture &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and marked the project as a &quot; &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee @-@ drama goes every one , nobody can imagine . &quot;
&quot; we can state football , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our ability to help the many refugees who have so incredibly ju@@ red , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim managing director Peter Ret@@ rac@@ ted spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
&quot; to the EM @-@ qualification game against Hungary at this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Ni@@ ers@@ bach marked the support of refugees as &quot; a large shared piece of German football . &quot;
&quot; that all 36 licensing agreements have launched its own projects , be great . &quot;
&quot; just as great , that small and smallest clubs are active . &quot;
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; that we have spent , will be in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the Association shared with the DF@@ B selection and the German Federal Government at 300 000 for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the associations have already called the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
Reports : SAP Pre @-@ St@@ ef now loses an eye in an accident
&quot; the head@@ board of Europe &apos;s greatest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost many reports by a fall in early July the left eye . &quot;
&quot; upon the accident at the stair@@ way in the house of his brother in the USA he was fallen in the USA after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost ble@@ eding , was power@@ less , then moved out to the street - that he told us so last week , &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ Where &quot; SAP @-@ Co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could go down his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet in front of the super@@ visory authority in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the 54 years old manager is involved with the meeting and &quot; full of labour . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thurs@@ days ) , in October he will come back to Germany and leading the pan@@ wers . &quot;
&quot; I am full of SAP , fully in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was able to see all the time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ promot@@ t comm@@ utes between Germany and the US , but since summer he was no longer at the German SAP Head@@ quarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important for him to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said something like that . &quot;
&quot; important is to stand up again , when you have fallen . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot magnesium except p@@ wh@@ ish ...
&quot; suddenly @-@ wit@@ ter@@ led a corresponding picture and declared , he suffered the injury , when he over@@ thrown off the wheel . &quot;
&quot; he therefore comes at night @-@ separate in Singapore over the weekend as little as a pre @-@ driver for the two pedi@@ gree Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and Jen@@ son Button , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ us@@ sia , Dortmund was able to final off all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group play in the European league . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well as in the du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 am / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot grasp it on him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ top@@ game against Lever@@ k@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach will be open again : &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of its pros , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his gene@@ alog@@ y position on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ position .
that is why novel Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes place the place of Bo@@ ke@@ eper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top @-@ level , &quot; praised the football @-@ teacher the world champion . &quot;
&quot; whether the course of course is used in all Europe @-@ league games for use , Tu@@ ch@@ el did not allow bank@@ ers . &quot;
with high probability he will also disp@@ ose the second participation .
&quot; the for@@ ce@@ tic statement of fellow @-@ players Re@@ us , that the final statement for the BV@@ B in the Europa League will be the aim of veri@@ fi@@ ably Julian W@@ eig@@ l for understandable : &quot; &quot; that &apos;s why Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think that we have a good chance to access the title .
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants to lead the pioneering role in Germany
&quot; according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany must be fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner by the German Federal Government on the transformation of the car . &quot;
&quot; the musician decided on Wednesday a strategy paper dating back to the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things can be investing in expanding digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke about Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the E@@ AA from an &quot; New Mobility Week . &quot; &quot;
&quot; automated driving and net@@ worked driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less steel , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said . &quot;
he wants to discuss this topic with his counter@@ part of the G@@ 7 states who are also coming together with representatives of the industry on the I@@ AA .
the Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ier of the Transport Ministry is among other things the importance of mobile broad@@ band design and a low level of growth on digital radio .
&quot; for testing new technology , a test circuit is currently being executed on the motorway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; to allow the driver &quot; &quot; no additional liable risks &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government intends to examine the legal framework &quot; legal framework , &quot; where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; thus , Germany wants to employ approximately internationally for that the permitted peak speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars of 10 to 130 km / hour is raised . &quot;
&quot; the German government is also aimed at supporting a change in the Vienna Convention so far , so far only to see the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; with automated driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
&quot; the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras , capture the environment and process the data in a matter of seconds . &quot;
&quot; following a study from the Ministry of Economic Affairs , the study will be technically feasible in high@@ ways until 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , driving cars are to be expected on public roads &quot; &quot; far to 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany , the study of the study for 2025 is about 8.@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital connectivity of the P@@ KW@@ s can lead to more safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; &quot; said the SPD &apos;s political police to Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of the driver must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
even the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; on Wednesday at the AA remaining survey of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the DU@@ CE@@ D decre@@ e comes to the result that only eight percent of the Germans believe that self @-@ autonomous cars will succeed in the coming ten years , 32 percent do not believe in it at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of the surv@@ ey@@ ed were surv@@ ey@@ ed until 2025 with self @-@ employed cars , over the US 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on an independent vehicle . &quot;
&quot; following a survey of the Digital@@ side Bit@@ k@@ om , only seven percent would be able to dis@@ connect while taking control during the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway that can be shown in flowing traffic after 15 percent , in St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; the Düssel@@ dorf@@ Congress will fight for the title , from 25 September to 4 October only in a single item . &quot;
the final decision should be handed down at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a great loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning , &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough , even without reaching the title , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jörg Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ ler said during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot;
B@@ oll has at this point on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsorship date in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return to Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the down@@ side , we are now no more such a clear favorite , &quot; explained single @-@ European politician Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ ci@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who led the se@@ duc@@ tor in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but reminded of the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; then , Timo was also missing , and we are European leaders . &quot;
&quot; in this we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; explained the World @-@ Air@@ one @-@ fifth . &quot;
the English soccer player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United had a serious injury to the right leg .
in the Champions League at the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven the def@@ ender was taken on a Tac@@ tical by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno and after a long treatment .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for a En@@ f@@ ant
there is a mixture of very great fashion show and a w@@ ax@@ work gre@@ gate tower : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : window man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ets which sc@@ ary thanks to video proj@@ ections .
&quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , which was described in other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits the great star of the Mo@@ des@@ scene - and with it that he put men in Romans . &quot;
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the end of Haute Cou@@ ture , because I made white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier it was very easy , meanwhile it is real , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th of September to the Kuns@@ thalle of the HY@@ PO Cultural Foundation , it is a bit of luck that the Mo@@ des@@ ch@@ ick pan@@ ties to a show about his person has changed . &quot;
&quot; actually he had been with it , because : &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a little bit after death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously made Canada in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; there is so much more than just beautiful dres@@ ses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the man &apos;s barely @-@ looking work of the man , in the fashion history , without ever having seen an education . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically the show is not structured but she is an excellent choreo@@ graphic work , for which much effort was operated : to fr@@ aming the doll@@ s , for example , became a sty@@ list . &quot;
14 tonnes of material have spar@@ ed the movers according to information of the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the October Revolution there was a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a le@@ ather@@ cord out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are slim as men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ ti@@ ers old Ted@@ dy is available in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ matic mo@@ dish @-@ testing of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he attracted his Ted@@ dy B@@ HS and clothes , he said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; with a pupp@@ et to play , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
the dism@@ ay of fashion was then joined later on .
he st@@ ined fashion journals and saw themselves the dr@@ afts of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich . &quot;
but later I bought the same course .
he was not able to pay the models for his first own fashion show .
they got nothing but thir@@ st but the gear .
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as fashion
previously it started on the long nit@@ rogen machines in and around Pl@@ auen to do meters .
&quot; the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and peaks have emerged in a great deal of customers , for example , for example to blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt , CEO of the Mo@@ desp@@ ised Gre@@ ys . &quot;
instead fashion is again important .
&quot; in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a bigger role , was then pushed through by the home textile industry - and now is re@@ discovered as an niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : top in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and in regional differences . &quot;
&quot; the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which rests in past styles , an increasing process of order . &quot;
who are not operated in Germany in the textile sector in Germany is no longer available on the market .
they already do their half of all orders in our company .
Mo@@ ol@@ ite Pl@@ auen is together with nine other companies member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and Stick@@ ers .
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
&quot; in the last 15 years , approximately 80 percent of the sales were broken . &quot;
private stores and also the wholesale trade is nearly no longer available .
our products can hardly reach the customer on this path .
the mass ware will be produced in the Asian region much cheaper and almost exclusively distributed on chains .
&quot; furthermore , the export comes to Russia and the United States . &quot;
enough reasons for new routes .
&quot; the branch association also tries to score points by environmental awareness , such as Cor@@ du@@ la Bauer of the nit@@ rogen in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year , we conduct a quality seal , that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; &quot; this also refers to the used materials . &quot;
Th@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Snow@@ eber@@ ger outside of the President of Z@@ wick@@ au - in the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embro@@ ider@@ ies and heads .
&quot; to continue with the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; it arises a cl@@ ash between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the factories , which must be above all economically . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly different to hold a customer base . &quot;
a few years consec@@ rated textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter the historical snow @-@ tip new .
the machine l@@ ures the machine in some areas of small cu@@ ffs .
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold gold@@ smith in Bianca Hall@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ kes , inspired by this : &quot; &quot; before I could not do anything with traditional sh@@ au@@ ener Spitze ® . &quot;
she now uses the snow@@ l@@ edges for your jewelry .
in an elaborate procedure they shaped the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the subject of &quot; &quot; Pl@@ au@@ ener &quot; &quot; - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - particularly to customers , their ancestors lived in ch@@ ew@@ ing and surroundings and who want to find a reminder . &quot;
I see my jewelry as a modern Ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; -@@ film
legends it does not have to be moved , but you still watch out a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it is not according to &quot; Entertainment Weekly &quot; but not a new approach , but about a kind of continuation , the 20 years after the first film with the magic child . &quot;
this is about the experience of the anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays out more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director is already firm : Rob Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI suggests the economy wider for the world
&quot; the economy must be wider outside , in order to foster growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said to the Tuesday of a group that was commissioned with the steering of the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should devote himself to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in an agreement at the 16th session of the central management group for further reform of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; new ups to promote and advance reforms will bring new momentum and vitality , and provide new space for economic growth , &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a number of policies , including a negative list to regulate the market entry , relaxation of border controls ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the sea @-@ system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement of a negative list , the sectors and companies will be identified , which will not come into question for investment . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance because it demonstrates the market a major role in the al@@ location of resources , a far @-@ state business environment and open the market , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also have control over the powers transferred to the companies and make sure that companies will decide how to manage their business .
&quot; the statement also said that China will allow China limit @-@ areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border business cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer , public controlled sectors will open , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will provide the right@@ ful interests of foreign firms and provide better services to them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it is made easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; which facilit@@ ates the requirements and the application process . &quot;
&quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors were also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; the meeting also played by Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important guides such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a declaration published after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mer@@ cury
the European Commission wants to double the threshold for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory and the consumers thus a clearly higher dose of the nerve .
&quot; the consumer @-@ organisation Food@@ watch , which is an appropriate working paper of the EU , criti@@ ci@@ zed the plans &quot; risks and side effects , mis@@ led industrial and environmental policy , &quot; stated Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , however , the threshold of the neur@@ otic for large fish at the end of the food chain such as Hai@@ der or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; &quot; economic reasons &quot; &quot; are raised by one on two milli@@ gram mer@@ cury in the kil@@ ograms of fish . &quot;
&quot; big be@@ asts , however , are so strongly exposed to qu@@ cury that are not allowed to be sold at current limits about 50 percent of the cat@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling of the threshold values , then only 14.8 percent would be de@@ ven@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in return for this attrac@@ tiveness , the EU wants to be tight@@ ening the threshold values with other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ gram to 0.1 milli@@ gram mer@@ cury and kil@@ ograms per kil@@ og@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; but Food@@ watch , but also referred to as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller bur@@ gl@@ ers , such as carp , are mostly so low to keep their planned maximum levels today . &quot;
&quot; the pul@@ ling in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ des of the pul@@ ver , that helps &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Mer@@ cury is a very poison@@ ous for man to reach the food chain of especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory pu@@ ff@@ ers .
&quot; the government is war@@ ns therefore , that &quot; small quantities are already capable of especially in the nervous inj@@ ections of the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Ministry of Environment explains in his homepage with regard to the current limits , however , that a &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
Mer@@ cury is due to the coal burning in the environment .
&quot; according to a written confirmation of the Federal Ministry of Environmental Office , the German Environmental Office of Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the production of Germany em@@ it@@ ated total . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish is about in El@@ be , the Rhine and the Danube is &quot; permanently growing , &quot; had c@@ ited the &quot; mirror &quot; in March of the paper . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings before mer@@ cury in fish are already one of the most common health risks in the EU War@@ n@@ system RA@@ SF@@ F . &quot;
