&quot; this data does not need to become in@@ cum@@ bent on the organization , provided that they remain in@@ accessible to further examination by the organization in the premises of the community without further access . &quot;
a ) i ) The organization carries the consent of the Community and States to the nam@@ ing of insp@@ ectors for the states .
&quot; II ) the Community raises either against a proposed designation or at any point against a ren@@ aming claim , the organisation of the Community and the States proposes one or more alternative ben@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; ( III ) If according to the repeat@@ able ordination of the community , the nam@@ ing of in@@ spec@@ tions of the organization will be disabled , the Council ref@@ using the ref@@ us@@ al to meet the executive director of the organisation - in the following as &quot; Director of Direc@@ tor@@ ate @-@ General , &quot; with the aim of meeting appropriate measure . &quot;

&quot; each State applies to the organization , including its assets , funds and funds , as well as to their spec@@ s , and other officials responsible according to this Convention , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the prer@@ og@@ atives and liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the backup measures according to this Convention are ended with regard to core material when the community and the organization has found that material consum@@ es or in a way that it is suitable for nuclear action , which is no longer usable or practically non @-@ reco@@ ver@@ able . &quot;
&quot; according to this Convention , the Community dict@@ ates the transmission of nuclear material from the states that is subject to securing the backup measures according to the Convention . &quot;
&quot; securing actions according to this Convention are concluded with regard to core material as soon as the recipient state , as in this Convention , has provided the responsibility for it . &quot;
&quot; the organisation guides documents from which each transfer and , if necessary , the recovery of the backup measures carried out on the further nuclear material . &quot;
&quot; should nucle@@ us material , backup measures according to this Convention is subject to non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the production of al@@ loy@@ s or ceramics , so agreed the community with the organization of such use of material , under which circumstances the backup measures should be termin@@ ated in relation to this material in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the measures shall be used during the duration of the non @-@ application of the backup measures according to this Convention for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear forces .
&quot; B ) The organization and the Community meet a settlement , that the li@@ tigation actions provided in this Convention will not be applied only as long as the core material used in such activity . &quot;
&quot; as much as possible in the regulation , such as long and under what circumstances these security measures are not applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the backup measures will be applied again in this Convention as soon as the core @-@ material will be attributed to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization is carried out above the total quantity and composition of this material in the relevant country , or on any transfer of such material from this state or the states on the current state . &quot;
&quot; this explains its consent as quickly as possible ; it extends only to affairs , such as temporary and procedure for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ s@@ ement or ren@@ unci@@ ation of military activity , and does not refer to the following usage of the core material . &quot;
the organisation ; the community and the States bear the costs that each of them will grow out of their respective obligations under the present Convention .
&quot; from the community , the states or individuals who are subject to their territory , however , as a result of a particular experience of organizing the organization , the organization re@@ imb@@ urs@@ ed this costs , provided that they are prepared in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation contributes to the costs of all additional measurements and sampling some of the organization &apos;s in@@ spec@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states certainly make sure that the liability shall be safegu@@ ar@@ ded for nuclear damage , including an insurance policy or other financial security , according to their laws and other regulations governing the purpose of implementing this Convention in the same manner as to the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
&quot; any claim to the Community or a State against the organization or the organization concerning the community or a state due to damage - with the exception of damage from a nuclear incident , resulting from the implementation of the backup measures according to this Convention , is regulated in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; if the advice follows from the General Director , the Council will not be able to make sure that the organization has not been subject to re@@ membran@@ ce , that no core material , which according to this Convention measures must be subject to stat@@ utes , or other nuclear missi@@ les , and may also take part in the other measures intended there . &quot;
&quot; taking into account for such steps the Council has been taken into account , in which mass was achieved by the applied backup measures , the community or the state - as far as each of the two contractors is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to allow the Council to provide the necessary security . &quot;

the purpose of this section of the Convention is to establish in the implementation of the terms of part I on backup measures as required .
&quot; the purpose of the backup measures established in this Convention is the timely discovery of the descent themes of nuclear prolifer@@ ation , nuclear weapons , for non @-@ known purposes , as well as the deter@@ rent of such an incl@@ ination by the risk of early discovery . &quot;
&quot; to the accessibility of the Article 28 designated targets , the material management is used as hed@@ ging of fundamental importance , and the observation of the spatial input and observation as an important suppl@@ em@@ ental measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical in@@ spec@@ tions of in@@ spec@@ tions through the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for any material amount , is specified for a specified period of time , under specification of the degree of accuracy for the specified measurement . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out their reviews , the organization makes for articles 3 full use of the backup system of the community . &quot;
the account@@ ant and control system of the community for core @-@ material according to this Convention is based on a division of material balance .
&quot; in applying its f@@ use measures , the community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following types and they , as far as required , as far as necessary , are intended for purpose other purpose and are practical : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system to determine the amounts of preser@@ ves , manufactured , transmitted , lost , or in other ways out of the stock of distant core and the creation of components ; &quot;
B ) the evaluation of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of the fair security ;

&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which existed for each material balance area , and the changes of this continu@@ ance , including the One - and outputs of the material balance zone , &quot;
g ) precau@@ tions that make sure that the data @-@ procedures and agreements shall be performed correctly ;
H ) methods for re@@ imb@@ urs@@ ement of reports to the organization in line with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the backup measures according to this Convention does not extend to material in the mining industry or the mining processing .
&quot; ( B ) becomes Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ hal@@ ogen@@ ous material which has not yet reached under code c ) in the United States , the community of organisation shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided that it is not implemented for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes . &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material , which is made according to composition and purity for fuel production or the process phase , in which it is made , or is applied that nuclear material or other , introduced in a later phase of the core @-@ powered nuclear material into the states , so it is subject to the others in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) The backup measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall not termin@@ ate for core material under article 11 mentioned conditions , however , the community is not liable for the recovery of nuclear material , the backup measures according to this Convention is not possible or desired , so consult the organization and the community across the use of appropriate backup measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The pre@@ backup measures intended in this Convention are concluded for core material under the pre@@ conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community notice that this core @-@ material is practically non @-@ reco@@ ver@@ able . &quot;
at the request of the Community the organisation fre@@ es the following core @-@ material for the backup measures according to the following Convention :
a ) special sp@@ alt@@ ed material when used in gram@@ ms or smaller amounts when sensor is used in instruments ;
&quot; B ) nuclear material when used in non @-@ nuclear activities after article 13 , if such core @-@ material is re@@ trac@@ eable , and &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with a Is@@ ot@@ open@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 who is over 80 % .
&quot; on request of the Community fre@@ es the organization nuclear material that would otherwise be subject to complete backup measures , provided by these backup measures , provided that the entire , due to this article in the States eman@@ ated in the states to no point more than &quot;
a ) a total of kil@@ ograms of special p@@ alt@@ ed material that can be made up of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of his weight , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment that lies under 0,@@ 2 ( 20 % ) and above the scope of natural uran , is calculated by multi@@ pl@@ ation of his weight with the thirty @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of ten met@@ ric tons of natural uran and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium by more than 0.@@ 005 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty met@@ ric tons de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium by an enrich@@ ment of 0.01 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; should eman@@ ate core @-@ material along with core material , which is subject to the backup measures according to this Convention , processed or stored , so will be made for the resum@@ ption of f@@ use measures on the material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organization of supplements which is required in the scope , which is necessary to determine the successful and effective regulation of the tasks of the organization according to this Convention , to determine the process specified in the Convention . &quot;
&quot; the suppl@@ em@@ ulations can be extended or modified , by amending the Convention and the Community without alter@@ ation to the Convention . &quot;
&quot; the suppl@@ em@@ ental con@@ ges@@ tions occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organisation , the Community and the States are able to enter into force by the entry into force ; an extension of this period requires the assum@@ ing between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; the organisation is based on the initial report on the basis of the complete report , the backup measures of this convention in the States , regardless of its origin , and execute this matter due to the subsequent reports and the results of their assessment . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) . &quot;
&quot; in ER@@ WA@@ EG@@ ING NA@@ CH@@ STE@@ IN , GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The EEC has decided to contribute to the Conference on International Economic Cooperation established in order to help the immediate requirement of individual countries with low income , whose development is disabled by general Res@@ sour@@ centr@@ alist problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the target of the EEC and the Member States , that the entire agreement has been tied to the agreement within six months , and as far as possible to enter into force in the form of loan , and the organisation will do its way to achieve that goal . &quot;
&quot; D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed execution and management of this agreement and the middle binary , to ensure a broad and balanced geographic distribution within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the EEC has submitted a table from which is apparent in what manner it intended to apply the criteria specified in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization establishes a special account among the term &quot; special account &quot; which consists of the funds , which is managed by the Member States under this agreement to the special response account ; this account will be referred by the Organisation as an &quot; &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; , &quot; and only in this agreement the organisation designated as &quot; &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; &quot; ) , and to the provisions stated in this agreement , and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special account will be separate and separated from any other accounts and activities of the organisation .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or in@@ alien@@ able deb@@ d@@ ment of the member states , which are to be paid upon request in the currency of the particular State on order of the organization as an administrator of the special reaction and in the organisation of organization of the organization in the relevant country . &quot;
&quot; B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . H . contribution shall be made between the EEC or another between the EEC and the administrator at the time ; &quot;
&quot; II ) the second amount of the amount of the paper to the 1 . January 1979 or at any other date , which was agreed between the EEC and the administrator , taking into account the deadlines given for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget . &quot;
C ) E@@ ach Member State can make payments before the above @-@ mentioned dates .
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker takes about the usual procedure of the organization about dis@@ proportionate pul@@ ations to the cash or the school , to cover the issues for the special respon@@ sive and to equi@@ p the special respon@@ sive account within appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; in the gran@@ ting of this loan , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided according to the conditions of the EEC of the following factors : &quot;
III ) to the extent that international economic factors have contributed to the current and subsequent economic problems of the country ;
&quot; VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service , and its further credit capacity to loan agreement , without delay ; and &quot;
VII ) the extent that the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each special loan can be assessed for financing a clearly fl@@ edged and rapidly ext@@ end@@ able development programme or lectur@@ er ( including a sect@@ oral program ) , which is independent , approved and managed according to the proceedings and practices resulting from the relevant entities of the organisation funded through ( letter ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this deal @-@ mentioned aims of the en@@ act@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special agreement must not be used instead of private funds from the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or organisation , which have already been approved within the framework of a loan or credit , which was approved by the directors of the Bank or the organisation . &quot;
&quot; apart from Section 4 we are subject to the same return conditions , which are generally valid for the development granted by the Organization ; they are thus refundable at ten years of age in 50 years . &quot;
special @-@ activity loan can be granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are payable in these currencies .
&quot; amounts to pay these fees are directly to the organisation , which it reserves . &quot;
&quot; each non @-@ special loan can be compens@@ ated by a separate loan agreement between the benefici@@ us@@ land and the car@@ et@@ aker , in which the origin of the means is given . &quot;
&quot; the revenues from any special offer can be used for expenses in the currency of the benefici@@ aries or for goods or services , which are manufactured in developing countries , the members of the organization are determined and which could be determined by the administrator at the time of the loan granted , recei@@ vers of a special reaction . &quot;
&quot; capital pay@@ outs from special content can take place on the special account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a Member State will be back as soon as possible by the administrator at the relevant member states . &quot;
the car@@ et@@ aker has taught until the completion of all special content : the EEC relating to the directors in preparation made by the directors in preparation and over the directors and programmes approved by the directors .
&quot; during the time of the payout of the special loan , the EEC Commission has taught the EEC quarterly every year over the development of the special offers and the spending . &quot;
the car@@ et@@ akers will be submitted to the EEC as soon as possible after completion of the business year &apos;s account for a detailed statement of the agreement with an announcement of its external audit@@ or .
&quot; after full payout of the non @-@ special loan , the EEC Commission provides as soon as possible an extensive report on the funds financed by the Group &apos;s special account . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker created and carries out suitable records and evalu@@ ations from which the contributions received on the special response account , made from the account issued and the account in@@ paid from the account and the pay@@ outs made to the Member States are obvious . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the complete issue of the special reaction account from time to time , through special respon@@ sive programmes or plans and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; if this agreement was agreed on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , the EEC and the organization may not agree , then the agreement and all the commitments arising from the parties are due to immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; the entire capital is to be paid back in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and transferred to Member States , so this agreement and all the commitments arising from the parties are ended with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement needs appro@@ ve of the individual member states and the EEC in accordance with the legislative provisions of each party .
governments of the Member States responded to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of the European Communities as the conclusion of the proceedings concerned .
the Secretary @-@ General leads these Noti@@ fications together with a notification of the proposed approval of this agreement by the EEC to the organization .
this agreement will become effective and entering into force on the first day of the month which follows on the day of input of the mentioned Noti@@ fications in the organisation .
&quot; this agreement is defined in two acts of Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch language , with each wording of the same period . &quot;
&quot; whereas the agreement in the form of a letter to change to the App@@ endi@@ x section 1 to the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss con@@ federation ( 1 ) , H@@ AT signed the following regulation : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss con@@ federation on the territory of the controlled nuclear fusion and Plas@@ tic@@ hy@@ si@@ k
&quot; the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community , below &quot; Euratom &quot; is represented by the Commission of the European Communities , below &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; , &quot; &quot;
&quot; and in the Swiss con@@ federation , the &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , below the &quot; Bundes@@ rat , &quot; below &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large pilot plant , the J@@ ET ( joint European Tor@@ us ) project , the construction and operation of a Common Company according to Chapter V of the Euratom treaty - below &quot; &quot; Common Company J@@ ET &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been dealing with research in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and Plas@@ map@@ hy@@ si@@ k and is well acquainted with the area in question . &quot;
&quot; as far as the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion is still comprehensive work to carry out , it lies in the interest of the contract parties in the present agreement , to avoid unnecessary over@@ cuts and have attained their respective research , which have attained a higher level of pri@@ ori@@ zation . &quot;
&quot; this agreement will enable every party to be able to take by a mer@@ ging of their research efforts in the area of the controlled nuclear plant and the Plas@@ tic@@ hy@@ si@@ k , as well as the common goal of these research practices , i.e. , cost @-@ efficient electricity generation , by using the controlled nucle@@ us action to reach faster . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the aim of the present agreement , the parties associate their respective application in Annex I and II of this agreement defined research programs , the &quot; Euratom program &quot; and &quot; Swiss programme . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss program assumes the long @-@ term objectives and forms of cooperation between the Euratom programme ; it will be amended or modified by the institutions mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , that it may include new activities that will be relevant for the Euratom program . &quot;

&quot; in the form of a letter between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ inian republic , about the trade of Ham@@ mel - and Lamb , &quot;
&quot; I honour myself , on the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to establish rules on imports of Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are as follows : &quot;
- Fresh or frozen Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV ) ) ;
&quot; as part of this agreement the export opportunities for Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b and goat meat from Argentina to the community are set to the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in array @-@ weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to ensure a fl@@ aw@@ less functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure that the agreed amount is not exce@@ eding the agreed quantity , and executed in accordance with conventional supply forms ( frozen or frozen ) . &quot;
&quot; if a change of the Offer form is possible , as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties shall consult with each other before introduction of such a change in the under number 10 , to find a proper solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community assumes the protection clause , it is obliged to bear the concern that in this agreement , access to Argentina is not touched to the community market . &quot;
&quot; for the event that the in@@ ro@@ de from Argentina can exceed the agreed volumes in one year , the community reserves the right to susp@@ end the ports of Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to restrict the exhaus@@ tion on import made by this agreement on a twe@@ et from 10 to H . ad val@@ or@@ em to limit .
&quot; by entering new member states , the Community in consultation with Argentina holds the number 2 fixed amount according to the extent of the Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
the duty of duty for these new Member States will be determined according to the rules of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; here the number 5 above Ho@@ ech@@ el@@ shall be taken into account .
&quot; the total quantity is set on number 2 , with the date of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community to 23 000 tons of battle weight . &quot;
&quot; the community takes everything to avoid market development , which could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine Ham@@ mel - and L@@ amm@@ ish on the common market within the agreed amounts . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community hits the community , in order for the sales of intervention stocks in fr@@ or@@ ted meat due to the implementation of the regulation of Argent@@ ine Ham@@ mel - and Lamb , not under@@ min@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; considering the goals and regulations of this agreement , the community agreed that any actual application of refund or other funding measures for the removal of ham@@ mel - and lam@@ bs , as well as from the ab@@ sent@@ encing certain living bases and lam@@ bs occurs only at prices and conditions that are associated with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of community trade in these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are set in a way that is compatible with Article XVI from the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention to the design and application of Article VI , XVI , and XX@@ III of the General inch and trade agreement . &quot;
Argentina guarantees the compliance with this agreement in particular that in agreement the quantities fixed within this agreement are given a fixed amount of export @-@ licenses for the products specified in this agreement .
&quot; the Community has committed itself to meet all necessary precau@@ tions to establish all necessary arrangements for the above @-@ mentioned products with origin in Argentina from the submission of a export license , which is designated by the competent authorities . &quot;
&quot; the details for the application of this system are determined so defined , that on the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ing of the company licence for the request of demand . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in Implem@@ entation , the competent authority of the competent authority of the Community has been filed in the responsible manner of the Community in regular intervals ; these details may be given as appropriate to identification country . &quot;
the committee is worried that the agreement is properly applied and smoothly works .
&quot; it exam@@ ines the tendency on the Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b and goat fl@@ esh@@ y market of both parties and on the world market , as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions which are important for the number 7 mentioned below . &quot;
&quot; the committee is concerned that the proper application of this agreement will not be affected by any products from Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b and goat meat in the agreement not named Tari@@ ff numbers after the community . &quot;
the committee discussed all questions regarding the implementation of this agreement and recommends suitable solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this agreement are beyond words beyond the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the quantity set under number 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December .
the amount entered into force by the entry into force of this agreement until 1 . January of the following year is set in relation to the total @-@ year quantity and bears the seasonal character of trade .
&quot; this agreement applies to the territories where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand the contract is on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the one hand . &quot;
&quot; it is valid until 31 . March 1984 ; after that time , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to cancel it with a deadline of one year in writing . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be checked before the 1 parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that must be comprehen@@ sible for necessary . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would like to agree with the consent of your government .

&quot; it respon@@ ds with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that the an@@ tigen D does not contain . &quot;
&quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D Sera must have a tit@@ anium from at least 1 : 32 towards C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0,@@ 9@@ 5.0 leaves . &quot;
an &quot; in@@ complete &quot; anti @-@ D ser@@ um is parallel to the uns@@ ol@@ ved of the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) Ser@@ um or a corresponding reference to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood@@ shot .
&quot; in addition to a reaction with all the red blood cells , which contain the an@@ tigen D , the ser@@ um is subject to the possibility of blood cell , the Do @-@ An@@ y contain . &quot;

anti @-@ C ser@@ um is extrac@@ ted from the blood of one or more people who are immun@@ o@@ zed through the on@@ or@@ o@@ ids C of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it respon@@ ds with floo@@ ding human red blood cells , which contain the an@@ tigen C , but not included with the human red blood cells that are not included in the C connector . &quot;
&quot; Sera are therefore specific for the C @-@ an@@ tigen only , specifically , if the blood @-@ tested blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percentage can be w@@ aved . &quot;
&quot; the title of the Anti @-@ C Sera ( &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 towards C@@ cd@@ de@@ e @-@ blood cells . &quot;
