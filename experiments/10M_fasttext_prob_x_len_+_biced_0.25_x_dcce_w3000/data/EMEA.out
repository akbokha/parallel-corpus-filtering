&quot; this document is a summary of the European Public Administration ( EP@@ AR ) , in which explains how the studies has been conducted according to the committee for human therapeutic products ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to provide recommendations regarding the use of the drug . &quot;
&quot; if you require further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package location ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or a pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you require further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg mel@@ ting @-@ coated tablets ( tablets , which can apply in the mouth ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection @-@ solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; am@@ us@@ res thinking and Spe@@ ak , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and mani@@ pulation ; • Bi@@ polar disorder , where patients can have various episodes ( periods ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood . &quot;
ins@@ fy is used to treat severe severe severe episodes and prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients suffering from the past to the drug .
injection @-@ solution is used for quick control of increased in@@ tru@@ ism or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both conditions , the solution can be applied to the one or the mel@@ ting @-@ coated tablets in patients , those stro@@ lling of tablets difficulties . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are simultaneously inter@@ fere with other medicines that are to be dismant@@ led , the dose of bili@@ fy should be adapted . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances , which allow communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ z@@ ole probably appears above all as a &quot; partial Ag@@ onist &quot; for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ otonin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ wns , such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in a slight extent than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters acts to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder , the activity of the brain contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thus reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and it will be prevented . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of bili@@ fy , to prevent the re @-@ emergence of the symptoms , was examined in three studies by up to a year . &quot;
the effectiveness of inj@@ uri@@ ous solution was compared in two studies with 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or similar diseases resulting in increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy over twelve weeks of 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study had stabili@@ zed the effectiveness of bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo , to prevent re @-@ occur in 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabil@@ ised with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
the effectiveness of bili@@ fy inj@@ ections was carried out in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that compared to increased dis@@ qui@@ ties with the by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies the change in the symptoms of patients based on a standard sk@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients , which spoke to the treatment mentioned . &quot;
&quot; the company also led studies by exam@@ ining the body , how the body conver@@ ts the mel@@ ting @-@ coated tablets and the solution to initi@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies with the injection @-@ solution patients , the bili@@ fy in doses of 5,25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received , a significant increase in symptoms of increased in@@ tru@@ ism than the patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder sufferers by bili@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ term studies man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo .
furnis@@ fy it also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo the re @-@ recur@@ rent sle@@ ek episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administ@@ ered in addition to an existing treatment .
bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses reduced more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similar effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to take ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , sea@@ weed ( mon@@ ast@@ ering ) , shr@@ ine , nau@@ sea ( sol@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , reduction , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , fatigue , fatigue , in@@ som@@ o@@ ness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ ek@@ iness ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the committee for human therapeutic products ( CH@@ MP ) stri@@ ves to conclude that the advantages of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ical episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes spoke to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , opposite the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Committee came to the result , that the advantages of inj@@ ecting anxiety in the fast control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , or in patients with some episodes of bi@@ polar@@ isation , if a oral therapy is not suitable to predomin@@ ate the risks . &quot;
June 2004 also shared the European Commission of Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Limited Ltd . a licence for marketing integration by A@@ bili@@ fy throughout the European Union .
A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is used for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ical episodes of the Bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ical episodes and their man@@ ical episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of the meals .
&quot; an increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as secondary or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar@@ ised disorder in patients &gt; 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient population , a lower initi@@ al@@ ous dose should be considered , if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ R@@ ector is set out from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
the appearance of su@@ ic@@ ide behaviour belongs to mental illness and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy ( see Section 4.8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder no increased addi@@ tive risk with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole in comparison to other anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ous diseases ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions , which are used for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ cr@@ ine , treatment with ble@@ eding drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which one year or less di@@ gesti@@ ble , there were occasional reports of during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; if at one with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y treated patients signs and symptoms of a sp@@ ig@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , should be considered to reduce the dose or break down the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that hin@@ der upon a m@@ ns , or unclear risk fever without having an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ otic , including A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , will have to be set . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ z@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was used in patients with c@@ amp@@ art cases in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or with states , which are used with caution and be applied with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene in patients with psych@@ oses which were treated with Alzheimer disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , an increased Ster@@ ber@@ k@@ isi@@ ko compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the appeal for unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ acid or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ary coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; there are no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia related negative events , with the A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic agents , to allow direct compar@@ isons . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ dac@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of gl@@ uc@@ ose levels . &quot;
&quot; gaining weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , and in patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie due to com@@ bi@@ dity , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , where weight is observed as a side @-@ effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle which could lead to grave complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally @-@ effective medicines such as star@@ vation ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a stomach acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ z@@ ole , with this effect however as clin@@ ically is not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers , increased a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Chinese ) the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ j@@ ole around 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to expect other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as fluor@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ is@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; at CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) Met@@ abol@@ ized &apos; , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in a higher plas@@ ma @-@ concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole resulting in comparison to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; if you take into consideration the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , the potential benefits should predomin@@ ate the potential risks to the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV @-@ proteins , can have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ is@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; after lowering of the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y should be lifted to the tin height before the beginning of the companion therapy . &quot;
&quot; dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be administ@@ ered together with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentr@@ ations . &quot;
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene per day has no significant effect on the met@@ abolic disorders of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ morph@@ an / 3 @-@ Metho@@ xy@@ mor@@ in@@ an @-@ Rati@@ o ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Wa@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ morph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should get out to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or have a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to the insufficient data base for safety in humans and due to the concerns studies at the animal studies , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the possible utility justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , in other anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines the patients should be fore@@ warned that hazardous machines , including power vehicles , to operate , until they are safe that Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 ) on than those plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medical side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the listed side effects are defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study for 52 weeks occurred in patients , which were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total of lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ern , D@@ yst@@ olic and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . ( 5@@ 7,@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS is 19 % in patients using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol @-@ treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients on plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study , over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients suffering from O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ical episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment . &quot;
&quot; in another study about 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % was in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under li@@ thium @-@ treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term endurance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; a comparison between patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , with which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , revealed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases the CP@@ K ( creatine ph@@ opho@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene ( patients ) compared to 2.1 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients . &quot;
&quot; for the side effects which was reported in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and about their appearance also during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ z@@ ole syndrome , Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and coll@@ amp@@ arts among older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
clinical trials and since the launch of the market launch were acci@@ dental or inten@@ tional hyper@@ sensitivity with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and no death .
&quot; although there is no information on the effectiveness of an at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; it is unlikely that hem@@ aly@@ sis is carried out in the treatment of an over@@ dose of flu@@ ori@@ zation , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol has a high degree of plas@@ tic@@ isation . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar@@ isation I can communicate via the combination of a particip@@ ative effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ ht@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on Ser@@ otonin 5@@ ht@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole showed in vit@@ ro a high affin@@ ity to the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ or and a moderate ag@@ ility to the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , for the ser@@ otonin 5@@ ht@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 in@@ ep@@ tive and for hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ or . &quot;
&quot; with gift from Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ z@@ ole in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy volunteers , the Pos@@ it@@ ops tom@@ ography showed an dose @-@ dependent reduction in the bond of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 rec@@ ept@@ or Lig@@ anden , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the coup . &quot;
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ z@@ ole in comparison to plac@@ ebo a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psychological symptoms .
&quot; in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study was in week 52 for the share of the Resp@@ onder patients , which included a response to study media , in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values made out of sc@@ ales , which were defined as secondary students , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery ampli@@ fiers , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo controlled study above 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , for Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher reduction of the return rate , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ on@@ z@@ ole group and with 57 % on plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in controlled , multinational double blind study conducted at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients acquired a weight increase of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dos@@ ages over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder revealed a plac@@ ebo over plac@@ ebo over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ z@@ ole towards plac@@ ebo no superior effectiveness .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole showed a compared to plac@@ ebo over superior effectiveness in week 3 and a locking effect that was comparable to that of li@@ thium or semi@@ op@@ i@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Ari@@ z@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also referred to 12 a compar@@ ative share of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ie , like li@@ thium or semi@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with an man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ mon@@ otherapy in therapeu@@ tical ser@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ mon@@ otherapy in therapeu@@ tical ser@@ um@@ - , y@@ iel@@ ded the con@@ gest@@ ant &apos;s effectiveness in reducing deficiency symptoms compared to the mon@@ otherapy with li@@ thium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase , over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , with Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ z@@ ole had achieved a re@@ mission with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly in preventing a return to the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on vit@@ ro @-@ studies , the enzy@@ mes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the Deh@@ y@@ dri@@ ch and hydro@@ xy@@ modelling of Ari@@ pi@@ j@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ sion is cat@@ aly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 cat@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ es period lies with approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ z@@ ole on CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ er@@ ers on CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; with Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in the pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic investigation of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia in patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
an item @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics y@@ iel@@ ded no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in the ethnic origin or the effect of the smoking on the pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol was similar in patients with severe kidney suff@@ iciency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose of study with a split of liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ P@@ ugh grade A , B and C ) showed no significant effect with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis in class C , which does not suff@@ ice to draw conclusions on their met@@ abolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on security sp@@ harm@@ ac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeti@@ tive gift , reproduction , gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity and for can@@ ic potential , the pre@@ clinical data have no particular danger to man . &quot;
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with doses or ex @-@ positions that have significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure at people so they are limited to the clinical use only limited or no meaning .
the effects embr@@ aced a dose @-@ dependent utilities ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ yma cell loss ) with rats for 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ fold the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State @-@ Ex@@ pos@@ ure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum @-@ dose for humans ) .

it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar@@ isation I can communicate via the combination of a particip@@ ative effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ ht@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on Ser@@ otonin 5@@ ht@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in controlled , multinational double blind study conducted at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients acquired a weight increase of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca . &quot;
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ z@@ ole towards plac@@ ebo no superior effectiveness .

A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y injection @-@ solution is applied for quick control of Agi@@ at@@ edness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with some episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if a oral therapy is not recommend@@ able .
&quot; once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be termin@@ ated with Ari@@ pi@@ ste injection @-@ solution and with the oral use of Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
to boost the res@@ or@@ ption and minimize the vari@@ ability is an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus @-@ Maxim@@ us muscle under re@@ fraction of adi@@ c regions recommended .
a lower dose of 8@@ mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can be given on the individual clinical status taking into account already for en@@ coding or acute therapy to be given ( see section 4.5 ) .

there are no investigations on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole inj@@ ections in patients with Agi@@ at@@ eness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were different from schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and man@@ ic ep@@ ages of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ins in addition to Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol inj@@ ections is regarded as necessary , the patients should be observed in terms of extreme se@@ di@@ ments or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole inj@@ ectors are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poison@@ ing ( by prescribed or illegal medicine ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ous diseases ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions , which are used for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ cr@@ ine , treatment with ble@@ eding drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;

&quot; clinical manifestations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consciousness and signs of autonomous instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ o@@ y , swe@@ ating and cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ dac@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of gl@@ uc@@ ose levels . &quot;
&quot; gaining weight increase is generally observed in z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia patients and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie due to com@@ bi@@ dity , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , where weight is observed as a side @-@ effect and could lead to grave complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was larger compared to the after all of the goods of Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ z@@ ole , in a study , in the healthy progression of Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) and which at the same time Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H@@ 2 @-@ ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a stomach acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ z@@ ole , with this effect however as clin@@ ically is not relevant . &quot;

&quot; the effectiveness of abra@@ x@@ ane has been studied in a prime study , participated in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , some of which had received an anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of abra@@ x@@ ane ( in all forms or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the use of a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicine ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 patients treated patients with abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients on the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients received the conventional Pac@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; consider only the patients being treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between drugs and survival such as the deterioration of disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer in terms of these indicators that x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicine . &quot;
&quot; it must also not be applied to patients , breast@@ feed , or before the start of the treatment low ne@@ ut@@ roph@@ ils in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the committee for human therapeutic products ( CH@@ MP ) introduced that x@@ ane in patient , where the first treatment could no longer be obtained , more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicine and that it has to be given in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs to reduce side effects . &quot;
January 2008 illustr@@ ates the European Commission to the undertak@@ ings xis Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited filed a licence for in@@ transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ b@@ ted to the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients , in which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is failed and for which a standard anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine therapy is not shown ( see also section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in case of patients with severe ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie ( Ne@@ ut@@ roph@@ ils ) &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or severe sensory N@@ europ@@ athy during the x@@ ane therapy should be reduced to the subsequent series to 220 mg / m2 .
&quot; in sensory N@@ europ@@ athy degree 3 is the treatment to inter@@ rupt , until an improvement of degree 1 or 2 is reached , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies conducted with patients with han@@ dic@@ apped ren@@ al function and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for applying at children under 18 years due to sufficient data for in@@ consistency and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ baked nano @-@ form@@ ulations of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should be removed immediately and symptom@@ atic treatment , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in the patients there should be no renewed abra@@ sive therapy cycles , until the ne@@ ut@@ roph@@ ils has increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and has increased the thy@@ ro@@ id number again &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while one clearly has not been proven in connection with x@@ ane in the context of the car@@ oto@@ x@@ icity , cardiovascular disease cases are not unusual , especially in patients with younger anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine treatment or cardi@@ ac disease . &quot;

ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was the most noticeable important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ B &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients with x@@ ane patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ B &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; in Table 1 , the side effects are listed in combination with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at any dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) . &quot;

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug which has already been approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also &quot; Reference quart@@ z &quot; ) .
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood cells , where in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur , in case prior to the intervention an own ble@@ eding is not possible and in which a blood loss from 900 to 1 800 ml can be expected . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be led under the supervision of a physician , who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the drug is shown . &quot;
patients with kidney disease and patients who want to make their own ble@@ eding is se@@ amed in a v@@ ene to in@@ ject .
injection can also be made by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have received appropriate instructions . &quot;
patients with chronic kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency or patients who receive any chemotherapy should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per Dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
&quot; the iron levels of all patients are to be controlled before the treatment to ensure that no lack of iron , and iron supplements should be administ@@ ered during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who receive any chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney disease can be caused by an@@ emia due to an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency . thus , that the body is not sufficient to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used to increase operations in order to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the effects of a blood @-@ loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell , into which one gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with administration as an injection in a V@@ ene in the frame of a main study with 4@@ 79 patients , who suffered in one with kidney problems caused by ren@@ unci@@ ation problems . &quot;
&quot; all participating in this study was reported at least eight weeks in E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , before they were introduced to se@@ amed or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the change in hem@@ ost@@ bin@@ ds between the beginning of the study and the evalu@@ ations period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also laid out the results of a study in which the effects of pr@@ pro@@ long@@ charged ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients were investigated .
&quot; in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ ost@@ bin@@ s of patients were maintained on Ab@@ se@@ amed , maintained in the same degree as with the patients who continued to obtain E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to these , patients showed continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl the output value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptom of a enc@@ ephal@@ op@@ athy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ inging , head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
se@@ amed must not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or one of the other components .
se@@ amed as inj@@ ecting among the skin is not recommended to treat kidney disease as further studies are required to ensure that this is caused by no allergic reactions .
&quot; the committee for human therapeutic products ( CH@@ MP ) led to the conclusion that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the provisions of the European Union , proof that the drug has a comparable quality , security , and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

the hem@@ ost@@ bin@@ an@@ aft should be about 1 g / dl ( mandatory m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of high blood pressure .
patients with chronic kidney suff@@ iciency and clin@@ ically evi@@ dity coron@@ ary heart disease or in@@ suff@@ iciency should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 The upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in objectives .
&quot; according to present findings , due to treatment of an@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney suff@@ iciency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency is not accelerated . &quot;
for tum@@ our patients with chemotherapy should be taken into account for assessing the treatment cost of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa gam@@ ble and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin response ( patients that may have to be trans@@ formed ) .

the decision for applying re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a health @-@ risk weighing under the participation of each patient which should also take into consideration the specific clinical context .
&quot; for patients who are intended for a larger elect@@ or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic procedure , if possible , prior to the beginning of the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who under@@ go to a larger elect@@ or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic procedure should obtain an appropriate Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ prophy@@ la@@ xis , since they have an increased risk for Lyme disease and vas@@ cular diseases , especially with an underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting point gate of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk for post@@ operative O@@ vas@@ cular events can be found . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , a epo@@ et@@ ine was not proven that they can improve the overall survival in tum@@ our patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ emia . &quot;

the most common side @-@ effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence thro@@ mb@@ osis events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ inen .

survival and tumor were examined in five large controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double blin@@ king plac@@ ebo@@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between the patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin patients to patients and the patient &apos;s patient .
&quot; in these studies , people treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ eness ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin @-@ treated patients with an an@@ emia due to various more common mal@@ ign@@ ome consistent , statisti@@ cally significant mortality than at controls . &quot;
the overall survival in the studies could not be expressed through differences in the incidence of thy@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis and therefore related complications in combination with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ eness ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin @-@ treated patients and at controls satisfactory .
&quot; there is an increased risk for ste@@ el@@ em@@ bo@@ char@@ ism in tum@@ our patients who are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ eness ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , and a negative effect on the overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are treated for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin in tum@@ our patients with the goal to transfer at least 13 g / dl , as too few patients were included with these characteristics in the in@@ consistent data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa determin@@ ations according to repeated @-@ given intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ value of about 4 hours with healthy volunteers and a somewhat prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney suff@@ iciency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the ser@@ um mirror of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is much lower than the ser@@ um mirror that are achieved after intraven@@ ous inj@@ ecting . &quot;

&quot; applied to patients with high frac@@ turing risk ( bon@@ rup@@ tions ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a s@@ ant hip , as with the fem@@ ur , a disease , which changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et at least 500 mg calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with ac@@ ac@@ upuncture should obtain a great dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; administration of Par@@ acet@@ amin@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy for inflammation ) shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ asta can reduce the symptoms associated with inf@@ usion , muscle aches , gri@@ p@@ pe@@ similar symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; since the ingredient in A@@ cl@@ asta der@@ &apos;s is like in z@@ eta , a part of the data box for Zom@@ eta was used for the rating of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis , and it was investigated the number of sp@@ ine and hip textures over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study comprised 2 127 men and women with o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis over 50 years , which recently suffered a ac@@ credit@@ ation ; it has been examined the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et A@@ cl@@ asta in two studies have tested on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared to six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
&quot; main indication of the effectiveness was , whether the salary of the al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ase in Ser@@ um ( an enzy@@ me , which builds bone structure ) in the blood to normal again or by at least 75 % compared to the output value . &quot;
in the study with older women the risk of sp@@ ri@@ dium in patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without other o@@ steop@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ ed@@ ents ) was reduced by 70 % compared to patients in plac@@ ebo by 70 % .
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without other o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis ) with those below plac@@ ebo , the risk of ac@@ ul@@ tures has been reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study with men and women with ac@@ ul@@ ac@@ upuncture 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta is a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients on plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ asta occur within the first three days after the inf@@ usion and are less frequent with repeti@@ tive inf@@ usions less frequently .
A@@ cl@@ asta may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other components .
&quot; as with all Bis@@ phosph@@ ates , patients are subject to patients with A@@ cl@@ asta to the risk of kidney failure , reactions to inf@@ usion and O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( die of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta provides information material for doctors who contains A@@ cl@@ asta to treat o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis which contains references how the drug is applicable , and similar material for patients in which the effects of the drug can be explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot;

to treat the post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis and o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis in men is given a intraven@@ ous Inf@@ usion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ asta once a year .
in patients with low @-@ traum@@ atic ac@@ upuncture , the administration of inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended two or more weeks after operational care for ac@@ credit@@ ation ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; for the treatment of the mor@@ bus Pag@@ et should be prescribed by A@@ cl@@ asta just by doctors , experience in the treatment of the mor@@ bus Pag@@ et . &quot;
after a treatment of the mor@@ bus Pag@@ et with A@@ cl@@ asta has been observed a long re@@ vocation period in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to save in patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta . ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently exp@@ edited low @-@ trau@@ mati@@ cal ac@@ upuncture , an initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 is i.e. or@@ ally or in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular vitamin D in front of the first A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , may be reduced by means of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
patients with kidney dys@@ functions ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended as limited clinical experience to this patient population .
older patients ( &gt; 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and eli@@ formity in older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
&quot; children and young people of A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended for use in children and young people under 18 years of age , as data for in@@ consistency and effectiveness are lacking . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended in patients with heavy kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) as for these patient population only limited clinical experience .
a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia is before the start of therapy with A@@ cl@@ asta by sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; because of quick retri@@ eval the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure can develop a temporary , occasionally symptom@@ atic Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ z@@ emia , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta so@@ - ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to save in patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta . ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer treatment , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ tical stero@@ ids , poor oral hygiene ) should be raised before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ ates an examination with appropriate correc@@ ting dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who require ori@@ ental gri@@ ps , no data are available if the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates reduce the risk for O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the max@@ im range . &quot;
clinical evaluation by the prescri@@ bing doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual self @-@ risk assessment .
&quot; frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days of administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , may be reduced by means of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ asta to@@ cks ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; incidence of as serious @-@ effect @-@ in cases of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation was increased in patients , the A@@ cl@@ asta got ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received plac@@ ebo ( 0,@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis studies ( PFT , HO@@ RI@@ Z@@ ON - Recur@@ ise Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall prevalence of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ asta ( 2.7 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.@@ 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( &gt; 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( &gt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) unwanted medication effects are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
kidney @-@ function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney function , which is expressed as acceptance of ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um creatures ) and in rare cases as an acute kidney failure . &quot;
the change in Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured before the administration of administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were comparable in a clinical study during o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis over three years compared to the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in Ser@@ um Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ asta treated patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; based on the evaluation of lab findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values described below the normal Schw@@ ab@@ l / l ) , at 2.4 % of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical study treated patients compared to 21 % of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et studies treated patients . &quot;

it follows that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate gall@@ bladder up to 35 ml / min does not require dosage adjustment to the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
&quot; because for heavy kidney functioning ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only restricted data , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;

&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a sub@@ class , called the bis@@ phosph@@ ate , and is used to treat o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , the o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis in men and the mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the fem@@ ur . &quot;
&quot; decre@@ asing blood levels of sex hormones , mainly est@@ rogen , which are made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass that is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; Pag@@ et Pag@@ et takes place of bone structure too fast , and new bone material is structured into being sub@@ ordin@@ ated what makes bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta works by setting the bone structure again norm@@ alized , thereby creating a normal bone formation and thus giving the bone again strength . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or you need to under@@ go a dental surgery , notify your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; use A@@ cl@@ asta to other medicines Please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ists or nursing staff if you use other medicines or have been used recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicine from those who are known to damage the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; for applying A@@ cl@@ asta along with food and drinks , you are worried that you take sufficient fluid according to the instructions of your doctor &apos;s doctor before and after the treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year which is administ@@ ered to you by your doctor or the patient as inf@@ usion into a V@@ ene .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to increase the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after operational care of hip . &quot;
Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et The usual dose is 5 mg that will be administ@@ ered to you by your doctor or the patient as inf@@ usion in a v@@ ene .
&quot; since A@@ cl@@ asta for a long time acts , you will be required to require further dose only after one year or longer . &quot;
&quot; it is important to follow these instructions exactly , so that the calcium levels in your blood will not be too low in your blood from inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et can work A@@ cl@@ asta longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment . &quot;
if the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta did not suit immediately with your doctor or hospital in order to arrange a new date .
&quot; before completing the therapy with A@@ cl@@ asta Falls you are ending the treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta weed , please use your next doctor &apos;s call and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
side effects in connection with the first inf@@ usion very frequently occur on ( with more than 30 % of patients ) are after the subsequent inf@@ usions but less common .
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches , occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; currently it is unclear whether A@@ cl@@ asta did causes this irregular heart attack , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice these symptoms after you get A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; physical signs due to low calcium levels in blood , such as muscle cr@@ amps or self @-@ brain feeling , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;

&quot; persistent pain and / or not healing wo@@ unds in the mouth or in the ja@@ ws were mainly reported in patients who were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ ate because of other diseases . &quot;
&quot; about allergic reactions , including rare cases of respir@@ atory problems , nuts and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , the tongue or in the throat ) , has been reported . &quot;
&quot; inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects you are considerably lower or you notice any side effects which are not listed in this usage information . &quot;
&quot; if the drug is not directly used , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 h at 2 ° C up to 8 ° C shall not be exceeded . &quot;
patients with a recently exp@@ ul@@ sing low @-@ traum@@ atis@@ ed ac@@ upuncture is recommended to make the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the operating supply of hips ac@@ upuncture .
before and after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta s the patients need to be sufficient with liquid ; this is particularly important for patients who received a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
&quot; because of quick retri@@ eval the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure can develop a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hy@@ po@@ kal@@ z@@ emia , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta so@@ . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently exp@@ ul@@ led low @-@ sad ac@@ upuncture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. local or in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular vitamin D before inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended . &quot;

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Publi@@ cation report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which explains how the study has been conducted to provide recommendations regarding the use of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insul@@ in diabetes ) . • There can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medication ) can not be applied together with another di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medication ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
&quot; it can be applied in addition to Met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which cannot be adjusted with metals in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; combined with a sul@@ ph@@ yl coating , or insul@@ in can be kept in combination with hy@@ po@@ gly@@ co@@ lic or insul@@ in with insul@@ in treatment ( low blood sugar ) , except for patients with hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here it should be reduced to the dose of sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ osis or insul@@ in . &quot;
&quot; this means that the physical insul@@ in insul@@ in can be better utilized in better and the blood sugar levels , thus reducing type @-@ 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients , the effectiveness of acet@@ yl@@ ated in tri@@ ple@@ therapy has been examined ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ yl resin , in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that blood sugar levels by using the doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg were cut . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the study therapy study , the effect of the additional gift from Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ yl har@@ dener was shown in a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by employ@@ ing plac@@ ebo on a reduction of 0.35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of account and insul@@ in in 28@@ 9 patients was examined , patients who increased Ac@@ tos in addition to insul@@ in revenue , to reduce the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 10 % after 6 months compared to patients who took additional plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual defects , infections of the upper respir@@ atory tract ( decre@@ es ) , weight increase and hypo@@ cris@@ s ( decreased sensitivity to maturity ) . &quot;
&quot; accounts may not be applied to patients suffering from drugs which may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic K@@ eto@@ oth @-@ t@@ ami@@ fications - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos in the framework of a mon@@ otherapy ( when used to use ) as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
October 2000 dealt with the European Commission of the Company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited permit permission to appro@@ ve Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , dom@@ ed and wear on one side the mark@@ ings &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the &quot; AC@@ TOS &quot; page . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also shown for the combination with insul@@ in in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is inadequate in insul@@ in and with which Met@@ form@@ in due to contr@@ ain@@ dic@@ ations or intoler@@ ance is un@@ suitable ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; for the use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. former heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should begin the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose of dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain or ec@@ de@@ me , especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve . &quot;
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure to gain weight gain and o@@ de@@ me when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insul@@ in .
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was performed .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports of heart failure was in@@ suff@@ iciency but did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased output li@@ enzy@@ mes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should not be used .
&quot; when the AL@@ T mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the standardization range are increased , the liver enzy@@ mes are re@@ acted as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that point out on a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ resolved nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , degrad@@ ation , degrad@@ ation and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are the liver enzy@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the decision whether treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on will continue , should be led by the clinical parameters of the clinical assessment . &quot;
clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has been proven to be a dose @-@ dependent weight loss which is caused by fat deposits and is associated in some cases with an hydr@@ ation projection .
as a result of a her@@ modi@@ l@@ ution performed under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a slight reduction in the middle hem@@ ost@@ bin@@ dings ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.4 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ ative controlled studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients with met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ ost@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant and insul@@ in ( relative reduction of the resulting form of 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ ost@@ ok@@ r@@ its at 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insul@@ in sensi@@ tiveness , in patients , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as oral or triple @-@ combination therapy with insul@@ in obtained , the risk of dos@@ oc@@ ular hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the launch was performed under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , about an up@@ surge or deterioration of an di@@ ab@@ etic Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ edi@@ an , with a reduction in visual ac@@ u@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ men , but distor@@ ting doctors should be aware of the possibility of a Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ edi@@ c ; a suitable oph@@ thalm@@ ologic diagnostic evaluation should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summar@@ izing analysis of announ@@ cements from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 Fr@@ ak@@ ings per 100 patient @-@ years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on untreated women and 1,@@ 1 Fr@@ ak@@ ings per 100 patient @-@ years in women , who were treated with a compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study about 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events , gradu@@ ates with 44 / 9@@ 05 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1,0 Fr@@ ak@@ ings per 100 patient @-@ years ) , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 Fr@@ ak@@ ings per 100 patient @-@ years ) patients treated with a compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes or enters into pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is decre@@ asing ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the investigation of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical @-@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ sag@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes , e.g. or@@ ale contrast por@@ in , calcium @-@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ellers are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on around the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 connector ) resulted in lowering the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to being due to treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which dimin@@ ished in the pregnancy and increased insul@@ in resistance of the mother@@ hood and thus reduces the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ate for the fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very frequently &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from present data not estim@@ able ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ mo@@ ors and the breaking @-@ inde@@ er of the lens as they can also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ le played over the triple of the upper limit of the stand@@ alone area frequently on as below plac@@ ebo but rare as in comparison groups below met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant . &quot;
in an Out@@ come study in patients with existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease the incidence of severe heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than those below plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; since the market launch has rarely been reported via heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , however , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insul@@ in or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; it became a summar@@ izing analysis of announ@@ cements from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8.@@ 100 patients treated with the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on untreated groups and more than 7,@@ 400 patients treated with related subjects . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years of running pro@@ active study , frac@@ tures from 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ) of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated patients compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) for patients treated with a compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days were no symptoms . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to work through a activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) which leads to the animal model to an increased insul@@ in sensitivity of liver , fats and skel@@ eton @-@ muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces gl@@ uc@@ ose production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral gl@@ uc@@ tance in case of insul@@ in resistance .
a clinical study conducted with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as Mon@@ otherapy has been continued for two years to study the time up to follow the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &gt; 8,@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatments ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the therapy started , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,@@ 0 % ) obtained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on at 69 % of the patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo@@ controlled study about 12 months , patients whose blood sugar has been dis@@ continued despite three @-@ month fail@@ ures with insul@@ in inadequate to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c , compared to the patients who received only insul@@ in ; a reduction in insul@@ in pul@@ sion in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
in clinical trials over a year in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has consistently shown a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the album / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ ot@@ ien@@ te compared to the output values .
&quot; the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , on 18 weeks submitted investigation into type 2 di@@ abe@@ tik@@ ern . &quot;
in most clinical trials were observed compared to plac@@ ebo a reduction of the total plas@@ ma tri@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as low @-@ foot@@ ed but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels .
clinical trials over a period of up to two years reduced Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total plastic @-@ matrix gly@@ z@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol . &quot;
compared to plac@@ ebo was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels observed during met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de reduced values .
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks reduced Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , not only the so@@ ber @-@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also enhanced also the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial enhanced tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d@@ mirror , which affects both an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ ca@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as on the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ co@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease in groups random@@ ized which received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; after oral application Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on quickly res@@ or@@ bi@@ ert , whereby the peak @-@ concentration of un@@ change@@ able pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in the plas@@ ma generally reach 2 hours after the application . &quot;
&quot; based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to efficacy in some of the triple is the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in Inter@@ action studies , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one could not have any relevant effect on pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical @-@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ sag@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 connector ) and lowers the Plas@@ tim@@ on@@ cent@@ ric of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radio@@ active mark@@ edly pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in people the mark@@ er was mainly found in mit@@ es ( 55 % ) and to a lower extent in the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the mean plas@@ ma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ ary period of un@@ changing pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on amounts to people 5 @-@ 6 hours and all of the active Met@@ abol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
the Plas@@ tic@@ on@@ cent@@ ric concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its Met@@ abol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy volunteers , but the fr@@ ying of the or@@ al Clear@@ ance of the mother sub@@ stance is similar . &quot;
&quot; in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies occurred with mice , rats , dogs and monkeys , subject to repeti@@ tive administration , plas@@ ma @-@ aug@@ mentation , an@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ cent@@ ric du@@ bi@@ ous hyper@@ trop@@ y . &quot;
this is due to being due to treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which decreased in the design of hyper@@ insul@@ in emia and increased insul@@ in resistance of the mother@@ hood and thus reduces the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ate for the fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were in@@ duced during the Rat elevated inci@@ den@@ ces of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male R@@ atten ) of the bladder epith@@ eli@@ um .
in a animal model of the family @-@ friendly Pol@@ yp@@ osis ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other Thi@@ avi@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons led to an increased frequency of col@@ lo@@ os .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and wear on one side the mark@@ ings &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the &quot; AC@@ TOS &quot; page . &quot;
&quot; the frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 Fr@@ ak@@ ings per 100 patient @-@ years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on untreated women and 1,@@ 1 Fr@@ ak@@ ings per 100 patient @-@ years in women , who were treated with a compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study about 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events , gradu@@ ates with 44 / 9@@ 05 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1,0 Fr@@ ak@@ ings per 100 patient @-@ years ) , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 Fr@@ ak@@ ings per 100 patient @-@ years ) patients treated with a compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
in a further study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in each with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were examined .
in clinical trials over 1 year the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has consistently shown a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the album / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ ot@@ ien@@ te compared to the output values .
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks reduced Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , not only the so@@ ber @-@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but improved also the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial enhanced tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d@@ mirror , which affects both an effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ co@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as on the hep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study clari@@ fies the target with regard to its primary end point , having a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ deadly m@@ yo@@ car@@ dinal disease , gre@@ enh@@ ances and re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , put the results close that with the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one there are no cardiovascular risk of risk . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and wear on one side the mark@@ ings &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other hand the &quot; AC@@ TOS &quot; page . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of announ@@ cements from random@@ ised , controlled , double blind trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and received more than 7,@@ 400 patients who were compared with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and showed increased incidence of bones in women . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study about 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events , gradu@@ ates with 44 / 9@@ 05 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1,0 Fr@@ ak@@ ings per 100 patient @-@ years ) , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 Fr@@ ak@@ ings per 100 patient @-@ years ) patients treated with a compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;

&quot; Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of cryst@@ all@@ ab@@ uses , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or seal ( &quot; stones &quot; ) , i.e. greater document cryst@@ als , which can lead to joint and bones . &quot;
&quot; if the urine test is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ ay for two to four weeks , the dose cannot be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment arrangements , still escal@@ ations may occur ; therefore it is recommended that patients must take at least during the first six months after treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic , further drugs for prevention of gi@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; the drug is not recommended in children and in patients , which had a tran@@ splan@@ tion , as it has not been studied for these groups . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , conducted at the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three of various Aden@@ ur@@ ic disp@@ arities ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to a plac@@ ebo ( hypo@@ medi@@ cam@@ ents ) and from Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine to treat hyper@@ ur@@ emia ) . &quot;
in the second study two dos@@ ages of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once every day 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 762 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once daily ; patients with kidney disease received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of the effectiveness has been the number of patients whose ur@@ inary tract has been under 6 mg / dl on the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study we had 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients , the Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who participated once daily 120 mg in the last three measurements of under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was in 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in no one of the 134 patients suffering from plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed between 1 and 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , rash and ab@@ normal li@@ vi@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; in particular in case of patient with cardi@@ ac disease , there is also an increased risk of certain side @-@ effects which concern the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the committee for human therapeutic products ( CH@@ MP ) stri@@ pped at the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ inary tract in the blood , but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects associated with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ in@@ emia in diseases that have already led to Ur@@ at@@ abl@@ ag@@ grad@@ ations , including one from the medical history known or currently present G@@ icht@@ ner and / or a G@@ ich@@ tar@@ thritis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ser@@ um line sp@@ ine after 2 @-@ 4 weeks still is &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dosage increase to AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function , the effectiveness and safety of security have not been fully examined ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and youths have no experience in children and juven@@ iles , the use of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient population is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; tran@@ splan@@ ts receiver since there is no experience at home tran@@ splan@@ ts , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease in patients with a isch@@ e@@ er heart disease or de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure is not recommended in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( see Section 4.8 ) .

&quot; the experimental studies do not release directly or indirect effect on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful with the control of a vehicle , handling of machinery or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C has not influenced their performance . &quot;
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the test @-@ in @-@ cardiovascular events in the Pi@@ vot@@ al study group was observed in the Pi@@ vot@@ al study program compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the Pi@@ vot@@ al study ) and in long @-@ term - extending studies ( 1.9 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient @-@ years ) although no statisti@@ cally significant differences could be found and no caus@@ al connection with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at .
the risk factors in these patients were a arter@@ ial @-@ erotic disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ous or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in health history .
&quot; frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( &gt; 1 / 1.000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( &gt; 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects which were reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and in all Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at treatment groups in total more than once reported are shown below . &quot;

&quot; the primary activity point was in each study the share of patients , in which the last three month have been specified in particular Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ els , &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;

the AP@@ EX study showed in terms of lowering the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ els level among 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) ( see chart 2 and figure 1 ) the statisti@@ cally used doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ act study showed significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional used dosage Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficiency rate of 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) patients achieved . &quot;
there has been no clin@@ ically significant differences in terms of percentage of serv@@ ings of ser@@ um@@ um dis@@ ent@@ ations in both their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in a group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function ) .

the data collected in two years collected data of the open extending study analysis of phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ saw sp@@ ine ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) decrease the incidence of incidence in the months 16 @-@ 24 . i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a G@@ ich@@ tsch@@ ub ) .
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the h@@ ops size , which in 54 % of patients had a complete dis@@ appearance of the k@@ ick@@ ness up to the month 24 . &quot;
raised T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5,@@ 5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.2 % ) in the open long @-@ term renewal studies ( see section 4.4 ) .

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis ( a disorder in which the bones are invali@@ d ) in women after men@@ opause , where there is a risk for a small vitamin D mirror . &quot;
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acid , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ - and vit@@ amine supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the oph@@ agus , the patient is allowed to take place until after the first food intake of the day , which is scheduled for 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; as Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from each other in pharmac@@ euticals , which are approved in the European Union , put the data submitted by former studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing the vitamin D mirror .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mirror in the patients were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those who recorded exclusively in Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also laid data before , indicating that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dosage is exactly the dose which is needed for preventing a bone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed during 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal he@@ ats ( muscles , bone or joints ) and symptoms of the diges@@ tive apparatus ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , mis@@ ation , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , mis@@ carriage , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ie ( fin@@ es ) , tag@@ ged abdom@@ en ( s@@ wir@@ es ) , as well as s@@ lei@@ gh abdom@@ en . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a possible hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D@@ 3 , or any other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE can not be applied . &quot;
it must not be used in diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus ; in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission shared Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ men Ltd. for the work of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE approved in the European Union . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , beverage or intake of drugs ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vit@@ amine supplements ) for the day . &quot;
&quot; following references are to be followed , to reduce the risk for ag@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) : &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed after the day of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ ynge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before the first food intake of the day , at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cus , active gast@@ ro@@ sive ble@@ eding or surgical procedures in the upper guest @-@ st@@ inal tract , except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , are given just under special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; eco @-@ carbon reactions , such as eco @-@ soph@@ ism , ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al ero@@ sion , were rare in patients with the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly were this severe and demanded a hospital instruction ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor is therefore to pay attention to all signs and symptoms that point out on possible op@@ oph@@ age@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out upon the appearance of symptom wor@@ os@@ oph@@ age@@ al pain , or new or become worse pain , pain , or new or worse off the medicine ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe weight@@ less side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or upon appearance of symptoms that point to an os@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation , continue . &quot;
it is very important that all d@@ osing instructions can be given to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large cases clinical trials was established with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk , became rare ( after market launch ) stomach and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , reported ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the p@@ ile , commonly referred to with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including O@@ ste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was given for cancer patients whose therapy @-@ ime has been given for intraven@@ ously cl@@ ot@@ ated bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there is no data available to give the hints , whether the de@@ coder of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy for patients who require a kie@@ ffer surgical procedure , reduces the risk of an o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the p@@ ile . &quot;
clinical assessment by the prescri@@ bing doctor is author@@ it@@ ative for the therapy planning of each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted that she should take the tablet into the next morning after taking notice of a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed its failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking on intake of one pill a week as originally planned for this week@@ day . &quot;
other diseases that inter@@ fere with the metabolism of minerals ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ di@@ tism ) should be also handled at the beginning of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ end@@ ron@@ at food and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some or@@ ale medicines can imp@@ air the res@@ or@@ ption of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at when they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait after the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific inter@@ ac@@ tion@@ studies have not been conducted , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was prescribed in clinical studies with a variety of usually prescribed drugs , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended solely for use with post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not used during pregnancy loss of nursing women .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at let not let any indication of directly ou@@ trag@@ eous effects with regard to pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development can be seen . &quot;

the effects of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at on bone mass and fr@@ act@@ ment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( FIT : N = 6.@@ 459 ) .

&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the cradle of the BM@@ D of sp@@ ine and Tro@@ chan@@ ter continues to maintain ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur@@ hal@@ ses and the whole body was maintained . &quot;
fit consisted of two pl@@ az@@ ebo@@ controlled trials included daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily to either 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily gift of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was reduced the appearance of at least a new sp@@ ine by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

&quot; in o@@ steop@@ or@@ os@@ ex@@ dia , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first eating or drinking of the day . &quot;
healthy volunteers has led the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( increasing funding in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
&quot; 9 distribution of studies on rats have revealed that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate disp@@ ers@@ ed according to intraven@@ ous goods of 1 mg / kg temporarily into soft parts , but then quickly re@@ distributed to the bones or after the urine . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous goods of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at have been found approximately 50 % of radio@@ active marked substance within 72 hours with the ur@@ anium used , and little or no radio@@ activity was recovered in the sc@@ rap . &quot;

Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is not sign@@ aled with rats not via the su@@ ction or bas@@ ic transport system of the kid@@ neys and therefore it won &apos;t be thought that it influences the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines through these transport systems .

&quot; although there is no clinical data on it , it is nonetheless expected that the ren@@ al Eli@@ mination of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at as in the animal will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;

Adv@@ an@@ raf is administ@@ ered for adult patients to prevent a kidney or liver to avoid a rep@@ lication of the tran@@ splan@@ tion used by the immune system .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft already used in the EU , the company has submitted the results of the study carried out previously with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft and data published in the published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transpl@@ ant , while the application of Adv@@ an@@ raf was compared with pro@@ gr@@ f / pro@@ gr@@ aft or Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; main indicator of the effectiveness has been the number of patients , where the transpl@@ ant after a treatment duration was sent from a year ( by example , how often a renewed organ @-@ transpl@@ ant or a resume of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , more studies have been carried out in 119 patients with kidney transpl@@ ant and 129 patients with liver transpl@@ ant surgery and investig@@ ates how Adv@@ an@@ raf is recorded in comparison to pro@@ gr@@ f / pro@@ gr@@ aft of the body . &quot;

&quot; in patients with a possible hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other components may not be applied . &quot;
patients and doctors need to be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines will be taken at the same time with Adv@@ oc@@ raf as the Adv@@ oc@@ raf dosage or the dose of the same medicine should be adjusted accordingly .
&quot; Hart@@ bl@@ ackl@@ es , ret@@ ardi@@ ert yellow @-@ orange gel , printed in red ink on the light yellow cross with &quot; &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; &quot; and on the or@@ st Kap@@ sel@@ dom part with &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transpl@@ ant patients should classi@@ fy this medicine or make changes in the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant characteristics of the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to tran@@ sh@@ allow@@ ances or to an increased incidence of side effects , including sub @-@ or o@@ immun@@ o@@ repression . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; change@@ over of formulation or regime should only be conducted under the stric@@ test control of a transpl@@ ant experienced physician ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; in a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dosage adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ enti@@ raf should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ airing and toler@@ ability in the individual case and on blood @-@ conditions ( see below &quot; recommendations
&quot; after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ent raf , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ mirror should be controlled before the switch and over two weeks after switching . &quot;
&quot; on day 4 was the system@@ ic exposure , measured as a tal@@ mirror , with both phr@@ as@@ ings for both the kidney and the patient @-@ based patient . &quot;
careful and repeat@@ able controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transpl@@ ant under Adv@@ an@@ raf to ensure proper substance exposure in direct follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clear@@ ance , can take a change to the Adv@@ ent Dos@@ is@@ esch@@ as several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient does not permit any oral intake of drugs , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be given ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml ) to manufacture an inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of application z@@ ur repression of tran@@ sp@@ elling must be maintained ; consequently , consequently , a maximum duration of the oral therapy can not be specified . &quot;
dosage suggestions - kidney transpl@@ ant prophy@@ la@@ xis of Tran@@ spl@@ ant@@ at@@ degrad@@ ation The or@@ ale Adv@@ oc@@ raf @-@ therapy should start with 0.20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; further dosage adjustment can be required later , as the pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after a transpl@@ ant . &quot;
dosage suggestions - liver transpl@@ ant prophy@@ la@@ xis of Tran@@ spl@@ ant@@ at@@ degrad@@ ation The or@@ ale Adv@@ oc@@ raf @-@ therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dose recommendations - switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ an@@ raf must be transformed by twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules upon a once daily intake of Adv@@ an@@ raf , so this conversion in proportion 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , referred to the entire day dose to take place . &quot;
kidney and liver transpl@@ ant after switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ an@@ raf once daily must begin the treatment with each in ari@@ al and liver transpl@@ ant initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis for prophy@@ la@@ xis of Tran@@ spl@@ ant@@ at@@ degrad@@ ation .
&quot; heart tran@@ splan@@ tion In adult patients , who are converted to Adv@@ ent , is a or@@ ale initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day every day at the morning . &quot;
&quot; other tran@@ splan@@ ts , although there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ oc@@ raf in pul@@ mon@@ ary , pan@@ ni@@ - and ectal sep@@ oul@@ ation patients , came down in a local initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.05 - 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day and in intestinal ul@@ tran@@ splan@@ ts in an or@@ al initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / day to use . &quot;
dosage adjustment in special patient @-@ groups patients with limited living @-@ function bl@@ ur maintenance of ble@@ ak in the targeted field can be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a lowering of the dose .
patients with reduced kidney function As the ren@@ al function has no influence on the pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required .
&quot; due to the neo @-@ Shi@@ oto@@ x@@ ic Pot@@ enti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ at@@ in@@ incl@@ ine levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ incl@@ ination and monitoring of ur@@ inary tract ) . &quot;
change from Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ent raf in conversion from a Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in@@ - to an Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the decline of whol@@ eness . the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ airing and toler@@ ability in the individual case with the aid of full @-@ time Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ tal@@ mirror controls .
&quot; it is recommended to perform common controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ levels during the first two weeks after transpl@@ ant operation , followed by peri@@ odi@@ cal checks during the period of accounting therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood @-@ escal@@ ation of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also change after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ an@@ raf , Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tion , changes the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in simultaneous use of substances , which might change Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full ble@@ eding ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ an@@ raf is a drug with a low clear@@ ance , you can need adjustments to the dose for several days until the ste@@ ady State entered . &quot;
&quot; the data in clinical studies can be concluded that successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the tal@@ mirror in the blood 20 n@@ g / ml is not exceed . &quot;
in clinical practice the tal@@ mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us usually lie in the first time after liver transpl@@ ant@@ ations usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with glands - and a low @-@ based patient at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent detection therapy of liver , kidney and heart tran@@ splan@@ ts have usually been used ble@@ eding in the range from 5 to 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to severe undes@@ irable events , including tran@@ sh@@ edding poll@@ ut@@ ations or other side effects which can occur due to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Under@@ standing or Over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; change@@ over of formulation or regime should only be conducted under the stric@@ test control of a transpl@@ ant experienced physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 Z@@ ur treatment of adult patients with transpl@@ ant rep@@ ul@@ ators , which proved to be proven to be a clinical trial compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants as therapy . &quot;
&quot; to prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transpl@@ ant studies in adult sl@@ ut@@ ant planning , and transpl@@ anting in childhood there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of Adv@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions formed to avoid a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels in blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal extracts ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) included , or other phy@@ to prevent defects during treatment with Adv@@ an@@ raf ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentr@@ ations in the blood is offered , since the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels will be subject to severe fluctu@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , such as cardi@@ omy@@ op@@ athy was described in Kam@@ mer@@ - or sep@@ t@@ oral hyper@@ trop@@ y , which therefore can occur even under Adv@@ an@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; additional factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ tical stero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid @-@ load and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be limited because of the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sun @-@ protection by means of a high protective factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered consciousness levels , cl@@ amps and visual dys@@ functions , should show a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ an@@ raf Hart@@ z , ret@@ ardi@@ ert , sol@@ act@@ ose , is offered in patients with rare her@@ edit@@ ary Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ intoler@@ ance , lact@@ ants lack or gl@@ uc@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@
&quot; simultaneous application of drugs or herbal remedies which are known as Hem@@ mer or indu@@ s of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reduce blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore advised to change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels in simultaneous storage of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain unchanged . ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was developed with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics like K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and Vor@@ os@@ ol , and with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ protests ( z . &quot;
&quot; Pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics studies , that the increase in the blood level is mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the im@@ itation of gast@@ ro@@ sive degrad@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ performance pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as is used in acute exp@@ ul@@ atory actions , can increase the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood or lower . &quot;
&quot; the effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as a CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines that can affect their metabolism through CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 met@@ abolic metabolism . &quot;
&quot; because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us de@@ pl@@ ore the Clear@@ ance of Ster@@ oid @-@ double @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tive and thus increase the hormonal ab@@ outs , is particularly careful with decisions about recep@@ tive measures . &quot;
the results of animals have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us inv@@ oc@@ ate the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ time .
&quot; the results of a small number of studies on transpl@@ ant patients , have no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , compared with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is a risk of unwanted events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy . &quot;

the tribut@@ ary profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants can often be found precisely because of the under@@ sc@@ iss@@ al infection of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; in the following are shown the side @-@ side effects according to their frequency in decre@@ asing order : very frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 , not known ( frequency based on the available data not transfer@@ able ) . &quot;

it has been reported on good or mal@@ ign@@ ant Ne@@ oplas@@ men including EB@@ V@@ - Associ@@ ated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours in connection with the treatment of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ uble and the high bond of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and Plas@@ map@@ rot@@ eine can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ zed . &quot;

Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a lack of factor VIII related diabetes ) .
dosage and frequency of use are assigned to whether Adv@@ ate is used for treatment of ble@@ eding or prevention of ble@@ eding in surgical interventions .
&quot; patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII lack , causing ble@@ eding issues such as ble@@ eding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extrac@@ ted from human plas@@ ma , but is produced according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; : &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which one gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of the human body factor VIII .
&quot; Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union named Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similar , but it is different from proteins to human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe up to medium heavy duty hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including 53 children under six years , the use of the medicine was examined for prevention of ble@@ eding , as well as surgical interventions . &quot;
&quot; in the main study the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate was assessed in the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new ble@@ eding sep@@ t@@ ments with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; respectively . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ z@@ zin@@ ess , head@@ aches , Py@@ re@@ xy ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human cont@@ ag@@ ation factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or one of the other ingredients . &quot;
March 2004 the European Commission president B@@ ax@@ ter AG shared a licence for transfers from Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution treatment are based on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII measure according to the place and extent of the ble@@ eding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following phase of hem@@ ical events the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period cannot be attributed to the indicated Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel ( in % of the norm or in i.e. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated . &quot;
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeated until the risk for the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment program , to control the dose of dosage and the frequency of inj@@ ections , an appropriate determination of factor VIII @-@ plas@@ mas@@ cot . &quot;
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 prophy@@ la@@ xis - prophy@@ la@@ xis of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be doses between 20 and 40 i.e. from factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plas@@ ma activities will not be achieved , or if the ble@@ eding is not controlled with an adequate dose , a test must be carried out to prove a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic interventions must be raised . &quot;
&quot; the delivery speed should be directed after the patient , with a maximum inj@@ ecting rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alised antibodies against factor VIII is a known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plas@@ ma by means of modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk , inhibit@@ ors to develop , cor@@ relations with the extent of the exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 will be positioned at the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
untreated patients ( P@@ TP@@ s ) with more than 100 ex@@ position@@ ages and an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ sch @-@ known In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or@@ development was observed after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another which is observed ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of the hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding has no experience . &quot;
&quot; in the greatest number of patients rising AD@@ R@@ s were inhibit@@ ors to factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who all previously untreated patients had a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ z@@ zin@@ ess ( each 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; very frequently ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , common ( &gt; 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1.000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , is not known ( frequency based on data available ) . &quot;

previously untreated patients from an ongoing clinical trial evaluated 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE untreated patients inhibit@@ ors to factor VIII .
the immune response from the patient to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed through the investigation of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant up@@ trend as well as an ongoing peak of the antibodies against anti @-@ Ch@@ o @-@ cell proteins , otherwise however no signs or symptoms resulting from an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;

&quot; based on the data acquisition since the initial design of the initial data , the CH@@ MP opinion has been rated as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP was required on the basis of the security @-@ fil@@ a of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which requires a filing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the approval has to apply for 5 years . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited filed a committee for human therapeutic products ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company reg@@ res@@ c@@ ind its application for approval by Adv@@ exin for treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; however , the chest , the brain , the bones , or the soft parts ( tissues that surround the other structures in the body , surround it and base ) . &quot;
it is a type of virus that has been so changed gene@@ tically so that it can be a gene on the body &apos;s cells .
&quot; with the virus in Adv@@ exin , it is a &quot; Aden@@ auer virus , &quot; that has been so changed that there can be no copies of itself and therefore cannot any infections in men . &quot;
advoc@@ acy would have come directly to the tum@@ ors and thus allow cancer cells to make the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is made from the non @-@ broken in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to the restoration of sh@@ ame@@ ful DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA can not be recovered . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , where the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company laid data from a study with a patient , at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of sub@@ building , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had responded to the questions of the company , some questions were still uns@@ ol@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; based on the initial documents submitted , the CH@@ MP is created on day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
according to the CH@@ MP opinion it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ exin in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore benefits for patients .
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration , and the security of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not proven enough that Adv@@ se can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company does not inform the CH@@ MP if the withdrawal consequences for patients , who currently participate in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ antage . &quot;
&quot; changing active ingredient &quot; means that the tablets are so assembled , that one of the effective components can be released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptom of seasonal Rhin@@ i@@ tis ( ha@@ y@@ fever , caused by an allergy to poll@@ en caused by nas@@ al infection of the nas@@ al tract ) in patients with nas@@ al s@@ end@@ omet@@ rium ( co@@ op@@ ed nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and young people over the age of 12 , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the no@@ stri@@ ps ( hidden nose ) . &quot;
a treatment of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be pursued by the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main factors have been the changes of the sever@@ ity of the h@@ ay fever symptoms that have been reported from patients before the start of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study patients were carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a default sk@@ ala , how heavy the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; during consideration of all ha@@ y@@ fever symptoms , the patients reported the Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , received through a decrease of symptoms by 46,@@ 0 % , compared with 35,@@ 9 % in patients , the pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al s@@ end@@ omet@@ rium , the patients showed an all@@ evi@@ ation of the symptoms by 3@@ 7,@@ 4 % compared to the patients who took des@@ o@@ at@@ adin alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate ( cardi@@ tis ) , phar@@ yn@@ gi@@ tis , tox@@ icity , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ ep@@ iness ) , sle@@ oc@@ ular disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is allowed to be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other components , viol@@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine ingredient or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( other medicines to treat allergi@@ es ) are not to be applied . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must not be used in patients suffering from a Eng@@ angle glau@@ coma ( elevated water pressure ) , cardi@@ ac or vessel @-@ conditions including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ osis ( hyper@@ ten@@ tion of the thy@@ ro@@ id ) or have already had a risk for hem@@ orrho@@ id stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission shared the SP Europe for authorisation for in@@ coming from aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is to swal@@ low in the whole ( i.e. without it cr@@ ush , to break or ch@@ ew ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to mis@@ use of data for in@@ consistency and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) not in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the end of the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the use of time for 10 days , since long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can be di@@ spar@@ ate by the time . &quot;
&quot; after decrease in the swelling of the mu@@ cos@@ as in the upper respir@@ ation , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin than mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contr@@ ain@@ dicated in patients who are treated with a mon@@ o@@ amine oxid@@ ant ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within the 2 weeks after the ter@@ mination of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tical activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o @-@ con@@ stri@@ pe , per@@ go@@ id , cab@@ erg@@ amine , al@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amin or other de@@ con@@ ges@@ tive Rhin@@ ology , phen@@ yl@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; the security and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient stret@@ cher , and the data are not enough to address the corresponding recommendations or dosage . &quot;
safety and effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dis@@ rup@@ ture and the data are not enough to address the corresponding recommendations or dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed that treatment in appearance of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ cardi@@ ac or ha@@ e@@ at@@ balls , ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a rein@@ forcement of head@@ aches ) . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of the following patients groups , patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia - patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ous in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours prior to performing dermat@@ ological testing , as Anti@@ hist@@ amine otherwise positive reactions to indicators for main actions or reduce their extent . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of clinical trials with Des@@ tru@@ at@@ adin , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol additionally administ@@ ered , however , were not clin@@ ically observed any clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ cent@@ ric of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests no significant differences could be observed between the patients with des@@ o@@ at@@ adin and those treated with plac@@ ebo regardless of whether dis@@ lor@@ enz@@ at@@ adin was taken alone or with alcohol .
&quot; the enzy@@ mes of disaster for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ tru@@ at@@ adin has not been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be ruled out . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 has not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor an in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; the in@@ consistency of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies but no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities as compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; as Re@@ production studies on animals do not always have to be transferred to people , and due to vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ al properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be used in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; patients should be elu@@ ci@@ dated about it , however , that it can occur in very rare cases to a fuel , that may result in impair@@ ment of per@@ versity or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms can vary between a Z@@ N @-@ depression ( Se@@ al , ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular conditioning ) and a Z@@ n@@ NS stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ter@@ als . &quot;
&quot; head@@ ache , anxiety , delicate Mik@@ tion , muscle mi@@ stress , and increased muscle voltage , coron@@ ation , fail@@ ures , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , t@@ innitus , t@@ innitus , t@@ innitus , t@@ innitus , t@@ innitus , t@@ innitus , and hyper@@ tension , or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ n@@ NS stimulation is especially most likely , just like A@@ trop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ drying , p@@ up@@ illen@@ rigi@@ d and - di@@ lat@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gast@@ ro@@ genic symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the im@@ itation of the umbi@@ lical cy@@ to@@ k@@ ins such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human m@@ oph@@ ile cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the im@@ itation of the expression of the adj@@ an P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ per . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults showed des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective s@@ laughter or the tasks connected to the flies . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials was observed in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily by no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the oral application of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can yield additional sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as increasing blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ cardi@@ ac or manifestations of a Z@@ S arousal . &quot;
&quot; there were 1.@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal rhin@@ i@@ tis , whereby 4@@ 14 patients received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determines the basis of the total cor@@ es for symptoms ( except nas@@ al fl@@ acci@@ dentally ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the decre@@ asing effect , determined by the nas@@ ac@@ ul@@ sion skin , was significant higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation groups . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose @-@ study on the pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is veri@@ fiable within 30 minutes after the administration in Plas@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; according to the per@@ or@@ ical application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze on healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow of flowing weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in day 10 . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of a pharmac@@ ocr@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ disciplinary one , which has been conducted with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult pro@@ ps , was noted that four pro@@ ps des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was poor@@ ly altern@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; a component respon@@ sive study indicates that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the sole source of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , according to the sole source of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine @-@ bio@@ compatible was for exposure to a Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on security sp@@ harm@@ ac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeti@@ tive gift , gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity and the Re@@ productive Tox@@ icity , do not allow pre@@ clinical data with des@@ o@@ at@@ adin but no special dangers for humans . &quot;
the combination poss@@ essed no greater tox@@ icity than its individual components and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine .

&quot; further studies were submitted to prove that the body is used the sy@@ rup , the solution to the one and the mel@@ ting @-@ coated tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application of children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us have been an average withdrawal of the sym@@ scores ( symptom score ) by 25 to 32 % in comparison with the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria was the decrease of the sym@@ ph@@ ant after six @-@ week @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % compared with plac@@ ebo patients . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us must not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin , or any of the other components . &quot;
January 2001 shared the European Commission of the company SP Europe for appro@@ ve of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
&quot; a tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to all@@ evi@@ ate the symptoms associated with allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter @-@ animal and Persian Rhin@@ i@@ tis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical trials to efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ el@@ adin in young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ ro@@ ught Rhin@@ i@@ tis ( Performance of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous disease process and can be resum@@ ed after the end of the symptoms and can be resum@@ ed with their resum@@ ption of treatment .
the pers@@ ist Rhin@@ i@@ tis ( Performance of symptoms associated with 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant interactions have been established in the context of clinical studies with des@@ o@@ at@@ adin tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol additionally administ@@ ered ( see below 5.1 ) . &quot;
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study the performance of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol was not reinforced by alcohol ( see below 5.1 ) .
&quot; patients should be elu@@ ci@@ dated about it , however , that it may occur in very rare cases to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , which may result in impair@@ ment of per@@ versity or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic urine tests , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects , reported on the more common than those plac@@ ebo were reported ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , Mund@@ y ( 0,8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0,@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
during a clinical trial with 578 patients from 12 to 17 years the most common side @-@ effect head@@ aches were treated with 5.2 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ el@@ adin and at 6.9 % of patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , administ@@ ered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ et@@ een clinical dosage ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the im@@ itation of the resulting cy@@ to@@ k@@ ins such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human m@@ oph@@ ile cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the im@@ itation of the expression of the adj@@ ac@@ al molec@@ ule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of a clinical trial with multi @-@ professional , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was administ@@ ered in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was administ@@ ered in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dosage ) over ten days , no extension of Q@@ T@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in a single @-@ dose study with adults , Des@@ tru@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes including the strengthening of subjective or the tasks connected to the flies . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis was A@@ eri@@ us effectively in the all@@ evi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ chin@@ ess of the nose , it@@ ri@@ ver@@ ence and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ chin@@ ess on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al which can be allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis in dependence on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent Rhin@@ i@@ tis and Persian allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent Rhin@@ i@@ tis is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks .
Persian Rhin@@ i@@ tis is defined as the appearance of symptoms for 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as provided by the total cor@@ es of the questionn@@ aire to the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ economic vi@@ tis was dimin@@ ished A@@ eri@@ us effectively produced by seasonal Rhin@@ i@@ tis stra@@ ined by seasonal Rhin@@ i@@ tis .
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic jud@@ g@@ aria was also examined for further forms of jud@@ g@@ aria since the underlying path@@ ological ology regardless of the in@@ ology in different forms is similar , and chronic patients may be visi@@ bly forced to recru@@ ited patients . &quot;
&quot; since the history of synthesis is an indispensable factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ultur@@ al diseases , is expected that deser@@ v@@ at@@ adin will also lead in other forms of jud@@ g@@ aria to improving the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic urine , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the lowering of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose of tin . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic urine was the minority of patients suffering from anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , from the study . &quot;
an improvement of the itch to more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients with des@@ lor@@ el@@ adin treated patients compared to 19 % of patients with plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and vig@@ il@@ ance , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics study , in which the patients infected with the general seasonal Rhin@@ i@@ tis population was comparable to 4 % of patients achieved greater concentration of des@@ o@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
there are no cl@@ ue as a clin@@ ically relevant sor@@ row after a once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
&quot; however , the enzy@@ mes for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ tru@@ at@@ adin was not yet identified , so that interactions with other medicines could not be excluded completely . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 has not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor an in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty sample , cal@@ orie breakfast ) does not apply to the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; the clinical trials performed with des@@ lor@@ el@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin , with a comparable grade of exposure to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no qualitative or quantitative differences in regards to the tox@@ icity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and from Lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on security sp@@ harm@@ ac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeti@@ tive gift , gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity and the Re@@ productive Tox@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin can recognize no special dangers for humans . &quot;

A@@ eri@@ us may be taken regardless of meals to all@@ evi@@ ate the symptoms associated with allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter @-@ animal and Persian Rhin@@ i@@ tis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of Rhin@@ i@@ tis are caused by children under 2 years of infection ( see below Section 4.4 ) and that no data are pre@@ valent to provide a treatment of a infectious rhin@@ i@@ tis with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ alies should play a role in diagnos@@ ing the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical investigations and corresponding laboratory tests and cut@@ ters . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of met@@ abolic des@@ i@@ fy ( see below Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years old , which are restricted met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical with those in children that have normal met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains Sac@@ char@@ ose and Sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not take with inherited problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , gl@@ uc@@ ose @-@ absorption or a Sac@@ char@@ ase inhibit@@ or in@@ suff@@ iciency of this medicine . &quot;
clinical @-@ relevant interactions have not been observed in the context of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets that Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol additionally administ@@ ered ( see below 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in@@ gest@@ ant intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the performance of alcohol are not reinforced ( see below 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall prevalence of the side effects of children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; clinical trials with adults and young people in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic urine tests , were reported in the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ professional study of adults and adolescents , administ@@ ered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ et@@ een clinical dosage ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 years ago , received a daily dis@@ lor@@ ative therapy of 1.25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
because the course of allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ill@@ ot@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults and children are similar to the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults can be extrac@@ ted to the children &apos;s population .
&quot; within the framework of a clinical trial with multi@@ disciplinary one to adults and juven@@ iles , in which des@@ lor@@ enz@@ adin was applied in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. the committee for human therapeutic products ( CH@@ MP ) officially distributed that the company rel@@ ay its application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of b@@ av@@ arian H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov , in adults and elderly people should be applied to the protection against flu , which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A @-@ virus . &quot;
&quot; this is a special type of vaccine , which could cause before a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; a Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out , if a new tribe of the grip virus emerging , that can easily spread from man to man because humans have not yet built immunity ( no protection ) . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the immune system the parts of the flu @-@ virus as &quot; &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
this is the immune system later able to form in contact with a grip virus this pedi@@ ms faster antibodies .
&quot; afterwards , the clo@@ ak of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recogni@@ zes the human body as body @-@ foreign ) , and is used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
an inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study had not been carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; by doing so , the extent of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine does not consist of fulfilling the requirements of the guidelines of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vaccines . &quot;
should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information on your treatment please contact your prescri@@ bing doctor .
&quot; if you require further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , with the human immune immun@@ o@@ evi@@ rus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which inf@@ ects the acquired immun@@ weak@@ ening syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is being taken as a solution for installation , but this cannot be investigated together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , since the safety of this combination was not examined . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be en@@ acted when the doctor has examined , which anti@@ viral medicines has taken before , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood has been judged that the virus is going to address the medicine . &quot;
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily working together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in children between the ages of four and twelve , and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is based on body weight . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ are reduced in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines the HIV lot in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
&quot; AIDS not cure AIDS , however , can delay the immune system and also delay the development of HIV infection and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , investigated in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ in@@ infected adults , which had not been dealt with in previously . &quot;
&quot; this with low do@@ si@@ sted rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicine A@@ gener@@ ase was taken in 206 adults , which had formerly taken protests , with other protests . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with no evidence of HIV in the blood ( virus @-@ last ) or the modification of the virus @-@ last after treatment .
&quot; in the studies involving patients having had no protests in previous studies , even after 48 weeks in A@@ gener@@ ase , more patients had a virus last below 400 copies / ml as being on plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children by reduced A@@ gener@@ ase , however , the Vir@@ us@@ last , however , were dealt with by the children , who had previously treated with prot@@ eas@@ ers , only very few on the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults , the formerly been treated with prot@@ eas@@ ers , lo@@ wered the viral therapy with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced drug A@@ gener@@ ase after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other protests : &quot;
&quot; in the patients suffering from HIV , the against four other prot@@ eas@@ ants , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the Vir@@ go last after four weeks as with the patients who continued their previous protests : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ are ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( Bl@@ ending ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , rash and Fati@@ gue ( ti@@ redness ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Am@@ pr@@ en@@ vi@@ r or any other components .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase must also not be used in patients , the cur@@ rants ( a herbal remedy for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are just as well as A@@ gener@@ ase , are taking place in high concentration in blood health . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines to HIV , patients may take the risk of a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( ab@@ die of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activ@@ ator syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of a infection , which are caused by the immune immune system ) . &quot;
the committee for human therapeutic products ( CH@@ MP ) have concluded that the benefits of A@@ generic medicines used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat with other anti@@ retro@@ viral infections in adults and children over four years towards the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken along with the pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic amplifier , but the committee confirmed that the use of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients having previously not taken any protest . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally registered under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific purposes only limited information . &quot;
October 2000 the European Commission shared the G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited for appro@@ vals from A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ eas@@ eless adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
&quot; for usual , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administ@@ ered by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r should take place under consideration of the individual viral Resi@@ sters and the patient treatment ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take is 14 % lower than by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ change@@ able on a milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r twice daily with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fication on@@ set of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ vi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of de@@ generative in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other pre @-@ chambers were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for applying for children under 4 years , due to the lack of data for in@@ consistency and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ generic medicines should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
simultaneous application is intended to be used in patients with mild or moderate liver @-@ functioning with caution ; in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions it is contr@@ ain@@ dicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ate of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ me 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements which may contain cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ cent@@ ric and a dimin@@ ished therapeu@@ tical effect of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tioned that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can also continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contam@@ ination with blood .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are usually applied together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients infected with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver impacts with potentially fatal consequences .
for the event of simultaneous anti@@ viral therapy of hepatitis B or C please read the specific technical information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing restricted liver function including a chronic @-@ active hepatitis also show an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on or other glu@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , is not recommended , unless the possible use of a treatment is the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ tical stero@@ ids , including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Stock@@ ression of the adren@@ al function . ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; because the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ atin and Sim@@ fer@@ atin greatly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of an@@ gener@@ ase and Sim@@ fer@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines , may cause serious or life @-@ threatening unwanted side effects such as Car@@ b@@ Amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Nor@@ mal@@ ised Rati@@ o ) , are methods for determining the substance con@@ centr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ are may be less effective due to decreased plas@@ mas@@ ons ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interactions with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ vi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills can be changed , however the information is not enough to estimate the nature of interactions . &quot;
&quot; when Meth@@ ad@@ on is given simultaneously with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be reported on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of tox@@ icity of a risk of tox@@ icity , due to the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col , it is contr@@ ain@@ dicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patients . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set at duration 5 when a rash may be accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms . ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; in patients , which received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including proteins , has been reported by diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an exc@@ itation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases in which therapy medicines were required to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with medication @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and the associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in h@@ amm@@ ile patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants , reports of an increase of ble@@ eding including spontaneous oni@@ ans and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ es were introduced . &quot;
&quot; at HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune def@@ ective , at the time of introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fact@@ orial mod@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ tical stero@@ ids , alcohol intake , heavy immun@@ o@@ repression , higher Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ) , were reported cases of O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ sub@@ str@@ ates with small therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with pharmac@@ euticals that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ate of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ me 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ate with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase is allowed to be non@@ stero@@ ids along with pharmac@@ euticals whose active ingredients are mainly associated with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and for the increased plas@@ mas@@ ons with heavy weighing and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical judge and lead to a res@@ end@@ ent development .
&quot; in trying to offset the reduced plas@@ mas@@ ons through a dosage increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , they were often observed unwanted effects on the liver . &quot;
I@@ oh@@ emian ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirror of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r can be hum@@ ili@@ ated by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient takes on cur@@ rants , the Am@@ pr@@ en@@ vi@@ r@@ ück is and , if possible to check the Vir@@ us@@ last and de@@ for@@ age the cur@@ d . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered along with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ vi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
&quot; 5@@ 08 % increase , for C@@ max , by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ vi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
clinical trials were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily that verify the effectiveness and in@@ consistency of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % lower when Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with calcium ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r in Plas@@ ma , which were achieved in combination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with calcium ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are administ@@ ered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a d@@ osing capacity for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , there is a narrow @-@ friendly monitoring , since the effectiveness and integrity of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there has been no pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic study on the application of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with th@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , however , is recommended due to the invali@@ d component of Di@@ dic@@ osis in order to lie at least an hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ vi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment required . &quot;
treatment with o@@ bl@@ avi@@ r@@ ence in combination with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ers would be ex .
the effect of ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in on other proteins and available restricted data allow us to be Ne@@ viral to the Ser@@ um@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ vi@@ r .
&quot; if these medicines should be utilized at the same time , caution is advisable , since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din due to the decreased / possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ mas@@ s@@ ails could be less effective . &quot;
&quot; when these medicines be applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical surveillance should be made , as a precise predic@@ ting the effect of the combination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to apply . &quot;
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in Plas@@ tic@@ on@@ cent@@ ric ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus a rise in the effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; when it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase is to be administ@@ ered to a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; Pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic Studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , however , the plas@@ mas@@ on of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol a day led to increasing the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in Plas@@ ma by 25 mg and the AU@@ C ( 0 replies ) once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines which are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhi@@ bit or indu@@ s of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are applied together with A@@ gener@@ ase , may result in interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be used on toxic reactions associated with these medicines when used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ eas@@ ants , it is advisable that Ant@@ azi@@ da should not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it can be too res@@ oral disorder . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ si@@ ves that are known as enzy@@ min@@ de@@ duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r can lead to a hum@@ ili@@ ation of the plas@@ mas@@ onry of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ can@@ al@@ di , such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ an@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ ai@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ vi@@ r , which may increase the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing with A@@ gener@@ ase can increase their plas@@ ma concentr@@ ations considerably and reinforce with PD@@ E@@ 5 @-@ inhibit@@ ors in connection with the side effects including Hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and Pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in a clinical trial in Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days of pro@@ str@@ ands , whereas the endo@@ gen@@ ase cor@@ ti@@ sol increased by about 86 % ( 90 % discount : 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase is recommended with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these gl@@ uc@@ co@@ stero@@ ids not recommended , unless for possible benefits of treatment the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ tical oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; at H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors like Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ il@@ atin , whose inst@@ ant@@ ation is greatly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced H@@ unting of the plas@@ mas@@ onry in con@@ current administration of an@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; since plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ers can lead to these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to My@@ op@@ athy , including an@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ se , the combined application of these medicines is not recommended with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to be a common monitoring of the therapeutic concentr@@ ations to stabili@@ zation of the mirror , since the plas@@ ma concentr@@ ations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase is not to be applied along with or@@ dis@@ ed Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while on the same application of A@@ gener@@ ase , must be approached with par@@ ental Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ ic Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ eas@@ e@@ oli@@ s indicate a possible rise in the plas@@ ma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am about 3 @-@ 4 times .
&quot; when Meth@@ ad@@ on administ@@ ered along with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be reported on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the low cost of reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation is given , like the Am@@ pr@@ en@@ vi@@ r@@ - dosage is to be adapted when Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered at the same time with Meth@@ ad@@ on . &quot;
&quot; in simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ mal@@ ised Rati@@ o ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of the an@@ thro@@ mb@@ al effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive is not predic@@ tive as well as alternative methods of contrac@@ eption .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended when using A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied according to me@@ tic@@ ulous dis@@ rup@@ tions of the potential benefici@@ aries for the mother in comparison to the possible risks to fet@@ us . &quot;

&quot; a reproductive study on pregnant rats , which was administ@@ ered by inhal@@ ation in the uter@@ us up to the end of breast@@ feeding Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , showed during the lac@@ tation period a dimin@@ ished increase in 12 body weight loss in post @-@ income . &quot;
the further development of the ann@@ on@@ ation including fer@@ til@@ ation and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r to the dam .
the iner@@ tia of A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults with children over 4 years in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most of the effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment effects were mild to moderate , occurred early and led rarely to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another simultaneously on HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the under@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; most of the above @-@ mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with releas@@ ers previously untreated patients 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( degrees 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ator than in connection with the degree of study , and in more than 1 % of patients occurred , and also under the treatment course of law changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ) with HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of vit@@ ro @-@ fat tissues , multip@@ lied in@@ tra@@ ab@@ domin@@ ating and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissues , hyper@@ trop@@ y of the breasts , and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ vi@@ cal fatty acid . &quot;
&quot; among 113 anti @-@ retro@@ fitted persons , who were treated with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ dov@@ ud@@ in over a medium duration of 36 weeks , was only observed ( pin b@@ aking ) ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;

&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ algorith@@ m defines resistance for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defined resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F / C / F / C / F / C / F / F / V / C / F / F / V / C / F / V / V / C / F / V / C / V / C / V / C / V / C / C / V / C / C / C / C / C ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended , always moving the current inter@@ pret@@ ations of the results of Resi@@ sten@@ cy tests . &quot;
on ph@@ onic resistance @-@ based analyses of clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phenomen@@ al inter@@ pret@@ ations of the activity of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ ants @-@ resistant insul@@ ates .
&quot; companies , which prop@@ el diagnostic resistance tests , have been used clin@@ ically @-@ phenomen@@ al cut @-@ off@@ s ( partition points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance testing . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r Associ@@ ate genetic patterns creates a certain bur@@ resistant to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on the resistance resistance between Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and other pre @-@ chambers , for all four Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r Resi@@ sten@@ cy , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ fitted patients , with which a Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r mentioned scheme ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ j@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 insul@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r retained his activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ants resistance resist@@ ances ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the insul@@ ates . &quot;
the early break@@ down of a reconc@@ ile therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits that may affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; the proof of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , treated with PI ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ kl@@ e@@ osi@@ dan@@ alog@@ y ( NR@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , so@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with a lower Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one NR@@ TI were included in the part study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis provided the non @-@ sig@@ nia of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the So@@ C @-@ PI group with regard to the time @-@ ad@@ mitt@@ edly change from the output ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the Plas@@ ma ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in Plas@@ ma after 16 weeks after a non @-@ under@@ weight shaft of 0,@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; the proof of the effectiveness of un@@ geb@@ oo@@ st@@ ved an@@ al@@ ase is based on two un@@ controll@@ able studies with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ generic solution was developed by 15 mg / kg times daily , 20 mg / kg times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereas the majority of patients were 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI patients had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) together with A@@ gener@@ ase previously administ@@ ered NR@@ TI@@ s .
&quot; after 48 weeks , about 25 % of patients included in the study showed a plas@@ ma @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ ated increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the starting value . &quot;
19 Basi@@ cs on this data should be considered in the treatment optim@@ isation of with PI pre @-@ treated children who were expected to be expected from &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ st@@ ained &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
after or@@ nam@@ ing the average duration ( t@@ max ) up to maximum ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
&quot; 5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max , by contrast 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) met with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; administration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % increase of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained in@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the scale and rate of the remains . &quot;
the seem@@ ing volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves to close a large distribution volume as well as a tremendous penetration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream in the tissues .
&quot; this change leads to decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in the plas@@ ma , whereas the amount of un@@ covered am@@ bo@@ un@@ avi@@ r that constitutes the active share , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bund@@ le Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components during d@@ osing capacity in the Ste@@ ady state @-@ state across the area of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min . ss &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines , which represent CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ ducing or inhi@@ bit or a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution should be given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ generic capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r @-@ Ex@@ pos@@ ure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is out of the solution 14 % less bio@@ compatible than the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ generic capsules are not inter@@ change@@ able based on a milli@@ grams basis .
&quot; the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neglected , therefore the effect of a ren@@ al function is likely to be minor to the Eli@@ mination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r @-@ plas@@ mas@@ ons comparable to those who are employed at healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r twice daily without con@@ current administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for can@@ ogen@@ eit@@ y with mice and rats , with male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ular Aden@@ omas with d@@ osing ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - triple ( rat ) of exposure to men , after twice daily gifts of 1200 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ vi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hep@@ at@@ oli@@ th@@ ular Aden@@ omas and Car@@ cin@@ ome has not been stopped and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
&quot; from the present exposure data on people , both clinical studies and the therapeutic application , however , has little evidence of adop@@ ting a clinical relevance of this findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity testing , the bacterial @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel testing to rats and chromos@@ om@@ al test , micro @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was amalg@@ am@@ avi@@ r neither nuts or c@@ oto@@ x@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver tox@@ icity can be detected and proven in clinical daily life by measuring A@@ ST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; so far in clinical studies , no significant liver tox@@ icity has been observed in patients suffering from the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase , even after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on the tox@@ icity in juven@@ iles , which were treated at an age of 4 days , both with the control and the animals treated with the Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in a system@@ ic plas@@ ma dimension that lay significant among ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage , however , a number of minor changes including Th@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and s@@ und@@ y skel@@ eton may be observed that point to a consuming development . &quot;
24 . if A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fication on@@ set of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ vi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
simultaneous application is intended to be used in patients with w@@ aking or easier liver @-@ functioning with caution ; in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions it is contr@@ ain@@ dicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; 26 For some medicines , may cause serious or life @-@ threatening unwanted side effects such as Car@@ b@@ Amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Nor@@ mal@@ ised Rati@@ o ) , are methods for determining the drug centr@@ ation . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set at duration 27 if a rash may be accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms . ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; an increased risk for a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y has been associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and the associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical judge and lead to a res@@ end@@ ent development .
&quot; 5@@ 08 % increase , for C@@ max , by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ vi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r in Plas@@ ma , which were achieved in combination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with calcium ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are administ@@ ered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a d@@ osing capacity for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , there is a narrow @-@ friendly monitoring , since the effectiveness and integrity of this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with o@@ bl@@ avi@@ r@@ ence in combination with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ers would be ex .
&quot; when these medicines be applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical surveillance should be made , as a precise predic@@ ting the effect of the combination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to apply . &quot;
&quot; when it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase is to be administ@@ ered to a reduction in dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there is no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium @-@ inj@@ ectors , such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ ai@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ vi@@ r , which may increase the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine . &quot;
in a clinical trial in Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days of pro@@ str@@ ands , whereas the endo@@ gen@@ ase cor@@ ti@@ sol increased by about 86 % ( 90 % discount : 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ mal@@ ised Rati@@ o ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of the an@@ thro@@ mb@@ al effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg of E@@ thin@@ yl@@ es@@ tradi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r by 22 % b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be applied according to me@@ tic@@ ulous r@@ amping of the possible use for the mother in comparison to the possible risks to the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study on pregnant rats , those of the att@@ estation in the uter@@ us until the end of breast@@ feeding Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r was administ@@ ered during the lac@@ tation period , showed a decreased increase in weight loss in post @-@ income . &quot;
the iner@@ tia of A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults with children over 4 years in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in the event of an over@@ dose , the patient is an indication of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) if required , are necessary support measures . &quot;
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated on gro@@ ove and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ ist cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % of shirts ( IC@@ 50 ) by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is located in the range from 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in the infected cells and amounts to describe N@@ µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ mo@@ g = 0,50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r retained his activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ants resistance resist@@ ances ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the insul@@ ates . &quot;

the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ular Aden@@ ome and Car@@ cin@@ ome has not been stopped and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
&quot; from the present exposure data on people , both clinical studies and the therapeutic application , however , has little evidence of adop@@ ting a clinical relevance of this findings . &quot;

the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take is 14 % lower than by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ change@@ able on a milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .

&quot; the application frequency and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dara depend on the treatment of treatment : • At a maximum of 16 weeks in the genital area Al@@ dara is up to a maximum of 16 weeks weekly , with four weeks of pause between the treatment of treatment , three times a week . &quot;
the cream is stra@@ ined from bed@@ side th@@ inner to the affected skin areas so that they remain enough ( approximately eight hours ) on the skin before it shall be washed away .
&quot; in all studies Al@@ dara was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( same creams , but without the active ingredients ) . • Al@@ dara was tested in four main studies for 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area each 16 weeks . &quot;
main indi@@ an for the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete cooling of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dara was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small b@@ ular cell car@@ cin@@ oma in which the patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dara or the plac@@ ebo either daily or five times weekly .
the main indicator of the effectiveness has been the number of patients with complete cooling of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara was also tested in two studies in total 505 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ants .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dara was more effective than the plac@@ ebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the full re @-@ healing rate was taken from 66 % to 80 % in those treated with plac@@ ebo patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dara ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or itch ) .

inter@@ ruption with the treatment described above should be raised when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or when in the treatment area an infection is observed .
&quot; if in the follow @-@ up investigation 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the races treated only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose was om@@ itted , the patient had to carry the cream if he / she noticed this and then continue with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; i@@ mi@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream is in a thin layer of puri@@ fying and puri@@ fied in the puri@@ fied manner , with co@@ war@@ ts in@@ duc@@ ted skin areas until the cream is completely de@@ duc@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in these patients there should be an imp@@ lication , between the benefits of treatment with i@@ mi@@ tigation and the risk associated with a possible dis@@ cour@@ aging of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot;
there should be a wast@@ ew@@ ater treatment between the benefits of treatment with i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organization of organ or dit@@ ing @-@ host@@ - reaction associated with these patients .
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily van@@ ity hygiene was carried out , two cases of severe ph@@ im@@ osis and a case with a circum@@ c@@ ision of leading stri@@ des were observed . &quot;
with an application of i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream in higher than the recommended dosage there is an increased risk to heavy local skin irrit@@ ation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases were also observed under proper use of heavy local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) which made a treatment needed and / or to a temporary physical impair@@ ment .

local main actions are frequent but the intensity of this reaction takes on general during therapy or the reactions are returned after completing the treatment with i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream .
&quot; if it is required due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to gravity of local door@@ step actions , a treatment break can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical result of therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after treatment .

&quot; i@@ mi@@ i@@ od@@ ine was not used for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ess ker@@ at@@ ants on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or the ears or on the Li@@ p range inside the lip@@ stick . &quot;
there are only very limited data regarding the use of i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od for treatment ac@@ tin@@ ess ker@@ at@@ ants of anatom@@ ical points outside of the face and the sc@@ alp .
&quot; the data available on the ac@@ tin@@ ess ker@@ at@@ ant on the under@@ arms and hands are not supporting the effectiveness in this application process , therefore such application is not recommended . &quot;
local main actions are frequently shown but these reactions usually take the intensity of intensity or go back after the therapy with i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream .
&quot; if the local trans@@ ac@@ companies are causing great discomfort by the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for some days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 AK@@ RAS are reduced to less complete heating rates as patients with less than 8 units . &quot;

&quot; those from an open , un@@ controll@@ able long term study after four years of present data show that about 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients clin@@ ically cured and this was also for 48 months long . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od at three times weekly use in one or two treatment rooms of 4 weeks , interrupted by a fort@@ night , treatment @-@ free period , has been studied in two double blind , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ trop@@ ic , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic AK@@ - L@@ ä@@ gen@@ ts within a @-@ related 25 c@@ m2 large treatment resort than on the un@@ easy pair of sc@@ alp or in the face . &quot;
the first @-@ year data from two combined monitoring studies show patients with clin@@ ician cooling after one or two treatment rooms a recur@@ ren@@ al rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
&quot; the approved indications of external co@@ war@@ ts , ac@@ credit@@ ation ker@@ at@@ ose and Super@@ dis@@ graphic bas@@ k@@ om occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients in general not and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dara Cre@@ me was studied in four random@@ ised , double blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( i@@ mi@@ i@@ od@@ n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od could not be shown in these studies with the d@@ osing programs there ( 3x / week for a period of &lt; 16 weeks ) .
a minimum system@@ ic intake of the 5 % of i@@ mi@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream with the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during three weeks during the three weeks .
&quot; the highest class concentration in the Ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amo@@ unted 0.1 , 0,@@ 2 and 1,6 n@@ g / ml for use in the face ( 12,@@ 5 mg , 1 bags ) , on the sc@@ alp ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated half @-@ time period was about 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ hours half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous study ; this points to a prolonged re@@ ten@@ tion of the drug in the skin .
the data on system@@ ic Ex@@ pos@@ ure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od according to top@@ ical application of patients aged 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to that with healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ visor .
in a four @-@ month study on the painting tox@@ icity in the r@@ atte led doses from 0.5 to 2.5 mg / kg KG to significantly lower weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; another four months long run con@@ stric@@ ted study to the paint application y@@ iel@@ ded no similar effects in the mouse .
a two year @-@ old study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity of mice in three days a week in@@ duced has no tum@@ ors at the application site .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od only possesses a low system@@ ic absorption out of the human skin and is not mut@@ ations , is a risk for man due to the system@@ ic exposure than very low . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice , which was treated with the real @-@ free cream , formerly known in larger number than in the control group with low waves . &quot;
&quot; it may harm other people even though these same symptoms have as you . − If any of the listed side effects you are considerably lower or you notice any side effects which are not specified in this usage information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
● Bo@@ war@@ war@@ ts ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itals ( genital organs ) and the anus ( After ) is a common basis ; slowly growing shape of the skin cancer with very low probability of the spread to other parts of the body .

&quot; in the study , the safety of the drug was tested , however , it was also measured by its effectiveness ( by reducing the effect regarding reducing gases concentr@@ ations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years of lo@@ wered Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , the G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in the urine of about 60 % , and half of the treated children rejected a normal great liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me at patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , pain @-@ pain , skin pain , pain pain ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limb@@ s ( in hands and feet ) , fever and reactions to inf@@ usion lines . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of the pul@@ mon@@ ary function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ the ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may be used in patients who may potentially have strongly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) on lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) , not to be applied . &quot;
&quot; the European Drug Administration ( E@@ MEA ) will update every year to all new information that may be known , and to update this summary as necessary . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients , the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , with regard to the reaction to inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies . &quot;
June 2003 the European Commission shared by the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for authorisation from Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by means of re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mam@@ mal @-@ cell cultural ( Chinese ham@@ ster of the Chinese Ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is at the long @-@ time enzy@@ me therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ out@@ let I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor that has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edit@@ ary met@@ abolic disorders .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be improved if the patient does not toler@@ ate all 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 e / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years has not been determined and used for these patients no d@@ osing scheme is recommended .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver suff@@ iciency has not been identified ; and for these patients no d@@ osing scheme can be recommended .
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients , patients may develop inf@@ usion reactions , which are defined as any associated side effects which occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion itself ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , specifically these patients should continue to be monitored in close @-@ ma@@ z@@ y , and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done only in a reasonable clinical environment , in the re@@ vit@@ alizing facility for medical emergen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , expected to form nearly all patients Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the treatment of treatment . &quot;
patients to develop the antibodies or symptoms of a inf@@ usion reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; because little experience with regard to the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , it must be cau@@ tious due to the theoretical risk of an over@@ sensitivity reaction after a break in treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the beginning of inf@@ usion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ movable ) to minimize the potential appearance of inf@@ usion reactions .
&quot; in the event of a light or medium @-@ severe inf@@ usion reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen should be raised and / or a reduction in inf@@ usion rate at half the inf@@ usion rate , in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a single , heavy inf@@ usion reaction , the inf@@ usion has to be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decrease , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen . &quot;
inf@@ usion can be recorded with a reduction in inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of inf@@ usion rate where the reaction occurred .
3 are ( Anti@@ hist@@ amine and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction in inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of inf@@ usion rate during which the predicted reaction occurred .
&quot; al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular image of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is applied . &quot;
&quot; the experimental studies do not release directly or indirect effect on pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; as no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , over the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended , during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me not to be silent . &quot;
the adverse reactions in clinical studies were evaluated mainly as inf@@ usion reactions that were observed at 53 % of the patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years of age ( duration up to 1 year ) .
&quot; unwanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during phase 3 @-@ 3 study and extending a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment of up to 4 years , are shown in the following table following the following incidence : very frequent ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) ; common ( &gt; 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ conditioned part of the upper respir@@ atory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history , moreover , heavy reactions to , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , air@@ still@@ s and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children &apos;s unwanted effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , who were reported during a Ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with mainly severe form of treatment and treatment of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg of intraven@@ ous once a weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg of intraven@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg of intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg of intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients there came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version in three months after treatment , whereby most of the patients under the age of 5 came up to a ser@@ otonin version ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature exp@@ ul@@ sion from the study ) , at 13 / 45 patients there were no attri@@ but@@ able antibodies before , including 3 patients , with which there never had been to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ versions . &quot;
patients with fl@@ es to lower anti@@ body levels are a robust setting of the G@@ AG Spi@@ eg@@ els in the Har@@ n while in patients with high antibodies to determine a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the resin .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ale until low @-@ neutral lar@@ ity activity in vit@@ ro that seemed to imp@@ air the clinical effectiveness and / or reducing G@@ AG in the har@@ p .
&quot; the presence of antibodies seemed to stand out in connection with the incidence of unwanted medicines , even if the appearance of undes@@ irable drugs , typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies . &quot;
the justi@@ fication for the en@@ gen@@ esis therapy is in one of the hydro@@ fluor@@ ic subsidies and the prevention of another accumulation of adequate recovery of the en@@ gen@@ tivity .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous Inf@@ usion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the cycle and cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were examined in a random@@ ized , double blind , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study that exp@@ elled the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients was from the middle phen@@ otype and only a patient rejected the heavy phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an for@@ ci@@ zed exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and 5 feet .
the primary outcomes for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute en@@ roll@@ ment in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
&quot; all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label instrument , where they were further 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients over the plac@@ ebo group an improvement of pul@@ mon@@ ary function and in@@ capacity which is represented in the following table .
&quot; in an open extension study , an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows from the following table . &quot;
the decrease of the expected percentage FE@@ V is not significant over this period of clin@@ ically significantly and the absolute lung @-@ vol@@ um@@ ina increased propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a Hep@@ atom@@ y , the treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal liver size . &quot;
within the first 4 weeks a marked increase in the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) has been observed until the study was constant .
&quot; regarding the heter@@ ogen@@ eous path@@ ogen@@ s between patients , using a combined end point , the clin@@ ically significant changes can be taken into account ( an expected process normal FE@@ V , distance in 6 @-@ minute intervals , for movement for 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the security and pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was investigated at the time of their intake in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients suffering from severe dis@@ continued form and 4 with mid @-@ course form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased due to increased gen@@ AG@@ - mirror in the urine week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 e / kg . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a heavy growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight increase ( n = 3 ) has been established after the Z @-@ score for these age groups ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mid @-@ course form , whereas the older patients with severe dis@@ infection can only limited limited or even no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , studies of a pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me met@@ ering circuits on the G@@ AG mirror in the resin , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg of intraven@@ ous once a weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg of intraven@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg of intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg of intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the d@@ osing scheme with 200 E / kg of intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks may be in patients who have difficulties with weekly infection , a reasonable alternative ; however , is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two d@@ osing is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate all new information which are available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug is updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged 5 years was similar to the elderly and less affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on security sp@@ harm@@ ac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in one non @-@ recur@@ ring gift , tox@@ icity in a repeti@@ tive gift and Re@@ productive Tox@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data do not allow special dangers to humans . &quot;

the active form of pesti@@ cide slow@@ down into the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to divide .
&quot; the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in its active form goes more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentr@@ ations of the active form of the drug and a longer rate of cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had not received any chemotherapy against their disease before . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ specific lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study were compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , which had previously been treated with chemotherapy , using the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;

&quot; patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin , passed an average of 12,@@ 1 month , compared to 9,@@ 3 months at the all administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received an chemotherapy , the average survival @-@ time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared to 7.3 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , patients , in which cancer is not the record epith@@ el@@ ial cells , in administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer periods of survival compared with the compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
September 2004 divided the European Commission to the company El@@ i Lil@@ ly Ne@@ derland B.@@ V. for authorisation for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each diar@@ rhe@@ a must be released with 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % iger so@@ dium @-@ injection @-@ solution ( 9 mg / ml ) - which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - S@@ IS is taken from below and with a 0.3 % natural so@@ dium injection @-@ solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml more dil@@ uted ( see Section 6.6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is used in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin displayed on first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ kl@@ ed bron@@ chi@@ al cardi@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is shown for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - or metastatic non @-@ metastatic bron@@ chi@@ al cardi@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body peak ( COM ) administ@@ ered as intraven@@ ous Inf@@ usion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as inf@@ usion for a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - Inf@@ usion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in case of patient with non @-@ low Bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma after prior chemotherapy is the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administ@@ ered as intraven@@ ous Inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; to reduce the incidence and gravity of home actions must be given the day before and on the day of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re @-@ gift , as well as on the day after treatment a cor@@ tical oid . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , it must be taken as at least 5 doses and the intake must be continued during the entire treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients must also obtain an in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular inj@@ ecting vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) during the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dosage and after each third quarter of the action cycle .
&quot; in case of patients who receive p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , every gift should create a full blood image , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a plat@@ el@@ et counting . &quot;
the al@@ kal@@ ine Ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( A@@ ST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ anine @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be &lt; 3 @-@ fold of the upper border value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle a dosage must take place under Ber@@ kl@@ ess of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood pressure or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ ic@@ ology tox@@ icity of the predicted therapy cycles .
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to references in tables 1 , 2 and 3 that are treated for ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or combined with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute common toxic C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) &gt; C@@ TC grade 2 hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age .
should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity &gt; degree 3 ( excluded neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity ) while therapy with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted before the patient is the value of treatment
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA has to be broken when in patients after 2 dos@@ ages reduction tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ? 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - at the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity .
clinical trials have no indication that in patients aged 65 year@@ - or in comparison to patients aged 65 years of age and up to 65 years there is an increased by side effects risk .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to sufficient data for in@@ consistency and effectiveness .
clinical trials were required in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance by &gt; 45 ml / min no dosage adjustment necessary to go beyond the dose of all patients recommended dosage .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance from under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients were examined with a liver ab@@ norm@@ ality of &gt; the 1.5 meter of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ der and / or Tran@@ sam@@ ase value of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper threshold ( near liver disease ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper border ( in the presence of liver disease ) not specifically studied in the studies . &quot;
patients need to be monitored with regard to the Kno@@ - mark@@ ings and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be administ@@ ered to patients before their absolute ne@@ ut@@ roph@@ ils are worth a value of &gt; 100,000 cells / mm ³ and has reached a value of &gt; 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dosage @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute Ne@@ ut@@ roph@@ ils number and maxim@@ ally non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity in the previous treatment cycles - see ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity such as ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie has taken place when a pre @-@ treatment with fol@@ ate and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients will need to be dependent on fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a preventive measure to reduce risk @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to middle kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ meth@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ meth@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ ated anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before therapy to avoid therapy and min@@ des@@ - TEN@@ S 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , intended for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is necessary to avoid taking ne@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ time for at least 5 days prior to therapy , in the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred , had corresponding risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid , accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space is to be weigh@@ ed into a dra@@ inage of the result in front of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re treatment . &quot;
&quot; serious serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ous acts , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events have been reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this substance is commonly administ@@ ered in combination with any other cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of shadow of life @-@ related diabetes ( except yel@@ lowing , this vacc@@ ination is con@@ trained ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible sk@@ ull of reproductive capacity is made up of reproductive capacity , men should be informed before the treatment unit , advice regarding the sper@@ mac@@ er@@ vation . &quot;
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &gt; 80 ml / min ) can result high doses non@@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ yl@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid in high dosage ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) lead to a decreased pair of effects of side effects .
therefore caution is advisable if in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &gt; 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or acet@@ yl@@ t@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid in high dosage .
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - TEN@@ S 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed will be avoided ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as no data is subject to interaction potential as with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , with a long half @-@ time , such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fec@@ ox@@ ib , must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - . &quot;
&quot; the large in@@ tra @-@ individual variation of the straight@@ ening status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ dec@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ mal@@ ised Rati@@ o ) , when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; there are no data for use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - An@@ tim@@ an@@ ol@@ ites are expected to become heavy duty defects during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be used during pregnancy , except if necessarily , and after thorough check of the usage for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible hypoth@@ esis of reproductive capacity is made , men should be referred to before the treatment of treatment to consult with regard to the sperm level of treatment . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed reads in the mother &apos;s milk , and unwanted effects in the Asc@@ ended Inf@@ ant cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of unwanted effects that were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with Mes@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om , and the random@@ ized cis@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed reads as well as 163 patients with Mes@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om , the random@@ ized cis@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;

the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients who received the medical treatment ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the mal@@ ig@@ ail Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om was shown in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin @-@ Arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the all@@ one Cis@@ pl@@ ine T@@ in @-@ Arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment movements are characterized by an improvement of the lung @-@ function parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin @-@ arm and a locking of pul@@ mon@@ ary function over time in control arm .

the probability of occurrence gast@@ ro@@ sive symptoms ( see Section 4.8 ) can increase if alli along with a fat meal or fet@@ ched diet is taken .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes may be in@@ compatible with improved met@@ abolic control , patients suffering from diabetes , before beginning a therapy with alli gains a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic must be adapted . &quot;
&quot; patients , which should be alli as well as drugs against high blood pressure or an increased cholesterol levels , should consult its doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage of these medicines must be customized . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to meet additional pregnant women , in order to fix the oral contrac@@ eption of the oral contrac@@ eption ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;

&quot; the experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of Or@@ li@@ stat are mainly gast@@ ro@@ sive nature , and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , since the absorption of las@@ ered fat is prevented . &quot;
the gast@@ ro@@ ve@@ al side effects were obtained from clinical trials with Or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporarily .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( &gt; 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( &gt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on data available ) . &quot;

&quot; clinical studies have been derived , that 60 mg of Or@@ li@@ stat , is taken three times daily , absorption of about 25 % of the food plant . &quot;
&quot; two double blind , random@@ ized , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I &gt; 28 kg / m2 occupy the effectiveness of 60 mg of Or@@ li@@ stat , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ or@@ ical , fet@@ ched diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change of body weight towards the output value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , has been rated as follows : as a change of body weight in study program ( table 1 ) and as percentage of those studies that have lost over 5 % or more than 10 % of its output weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction of 12 months was observed , the greatest weight loss occurs in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in the overall cholester@@ in was with Or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg -@@ 2.@@ 4 % ( output equivalent to 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and on plac@@ ebo + 2.9 % ( output equivalent to 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

&quot; Alo@@ xi is applied for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chemotherapy , the excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as Cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ ere , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
alo@@ xi is able to increase the effectiveness of alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a drug which can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics ) .
the use in patients under 18 years is not recommended as the effects of this age group does not require enough information .
&quot; this means that the ingredient is extrac@@ ting the attachment of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was investigated in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults , which received chemotherapy , which are strong or excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in cases of chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 59 % of the patients were treated with Alo@@ xi ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in cases of chemotherapy , the excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 81 % of patients showed that with Alo@@ xi received , over 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 from 189 ) , compared to 69 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were at 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 the European Commission told the European Commission of Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd from Direc@@ tion Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indi@@ p@@ tive : to prevent acute symptoms and v@@ om@@ iting at severe chemotherapy due to cancer @-@ cancer and the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting chemotherapy due to cancer .
&quot; the effectiveness of alo@@ xi to prevent nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , in@@ duced by a strong em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy , can be reinforced by adding any given cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; because Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ dar@@ ing age , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a subtle I@@ le@@ us according to the injection of eng@@ ma@@ ho@@ g . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advisable to extend the property of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t- inter@@ v@@ alle is extended or who tend to be such an extension . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with further chemical otherap@@ eu@@ tics , Alo@@ xi is supposed to be used either in the days of chemotherapy nor to treat nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical studies hem@@ med Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , for tum@@ ours of the five studied chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics ( cis@@ pl@@ atin , cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ - concentration of oral met@@ o@@ cl@@ op@@ ram@@ ids , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in one of a population @-@ based pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic analysis has been shown that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ine ( D@@ ex@@ o@@ dar@@ on , C@@ elec@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , C@@ elec@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , St@@ ani@@ ti@@ tin , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ alin and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experience for the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies can not be applied , therefore , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women , unless it is prescribed by the prescri@@ bing doctor . &quot;
clinical studies were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams at observed side effects ( total of 633 patients ) who were at least possibly faced with alo@@ xi related to head@@ ache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of over@@ sensitivity and reactions to the schedule ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were stated in post @-@ marketing experience . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies of unwanted events like in the other d@@ osing groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships . &quot;
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , due to the great distribution of di@@ aly@@ sis , however , it is probably not an effective therapy for alo@@ on - over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies were given a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ated chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2 , car@@ ob , or 750 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time ) received from day 1 without D@@ ex@@ or@@ th@@ as@@ on intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ized twin @-@ blin@@ ded study were a total of 667 patients who received a strong em@@ et@@ ected chemotherapy with &gt; 60 mg / m2 featuring D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azin and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , treated with patients who were given 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron that were given to day 1 intraven@@ ously . &quot;
the results of the studies with moder@@ ated em@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy is summar@@ ised in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical studies on the indication of chemotherapy in@@ duced sickness and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and E@@ KG parameters , including the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to the findings of the pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block from the v@@ entri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation of the I@@ onic channels and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the study of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers , was the assessment of the E@@ KG effects of i.@@ v. administ@@ ered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in individual cases of 0,25 , 0,75 and side@@ mg . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follows an initi@@ ating force of the Plas@@ fl@@ on@@ cent@@ ric , a slow Eli@@ mination of the body with an average season half @-@ time of about 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ cent@@ ric ( C@@ max ) and the surface below the concentr@@ ations @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C0@@ - ∞ ) are generally located throughout the entire dosage area of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous goods of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average of 11 consecutive year ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron Plas@@ fl@@ on@@ cent@@ ric at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations goes forth that the real @-@ intraven@@ ous plac@@ enta reached by 0,25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on three consecutive days ( AU@@ C0@@ - ∞ ) with which after a unique intraven@@ ous administration of 0,75 mg higher . however , the C@@ max was up after the width of 0,75 mg higher . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % are eliminated by the kid@@ neys , and roughly further 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abolic technologies that have compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro studies for met@@ abolic isation have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ enzy@@ me CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 at the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are involved . &quot;
&quot; Eli@@ mination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron became about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine recur@@ rent , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ change@@ able substance made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
after a unique intraven@@ ous bol@@ act on healthy was the total body : 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
&quot; although patients with severe liver dis@@ rup@@ ture the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ es and the average system exposure coupled with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , a reduction of the dose is however non @-@ justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only according to executive positions which are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , indicating a low relevance for the clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 From pre @-@ clinical trials , evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentration of I@@ onic channels that can be involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the action of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose which were given daily in about the 30@@ times of the therapeutic exposure , endo@@ cr@@ ine Ne@@ oplas@@ men ( in thy@@ ro@@ id , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mark ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not with mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the high doses and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for unique application , the relevance of these results is low to humans . &quot;

June 2006 the committee used for human therapeutic products ( CH@@ MP ) provides a negative expertise in which the ob@@ struction of approval for the remedy of hepatitis C is recommended to the treatment of hepatitis C in Hel@@ eon 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ections .
this means that the Alph@@ eon of a biological drug named Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A should be similar to an effective component with the same solar component ( also referred to in the EU ( also &quot; Reference quart@@ z ) .
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ containing ) hepatitis C ( one by viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic study , the liver cir@@ rh@@ osis damages resulting from the liver enzy@@ mes Al@@ an@@ in@@ - Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood . &quot;
it is produced by a yeast into which one gene ( DNA ) has been introduced to this to the formation of the active ingredient .
&quot; the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon laid data prior to the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredients , composition and purity of the drug , efficiency , safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
in the study of patients with hepatitis C the effectiveness of Alph@@ as@@ eon was compared with the effectiveness of your reference to 455 patients .
&quot; in the study was measured , how many patients after 12 of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after setting the treatment were used to the medication ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;

&quot; furthermore , concerns have further expressed concerns that the data on the stability of the active drug and the pharmaceutical drugs have not been eliminated . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , which spoke to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study . &quot;
&quot; after adjustment of the treatment with al@@ eon flame ret@@ ard@@ ant the disease in more patients again than with the reference point of reference ; in addition , al@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; aside from that , in the study , the test became an immune response ( i.e. the body forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms anti@@ body - special proteins , against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it may be applied to the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with cl@@ amping formation , her@@ ed skin infection ) and small in@@ infected la@@ undering ( cr@@ acking or ch@@ illing ) , shut@@ ters and s@@ ut@@ ured wo@@ unds . &quot;
al@@ tar@@ go is not supposed to be used for treating infections that have no@@ is@@ tically or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ir@@ resist@@ ent St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go against these kinds of infections might not work .
&quot; al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but with patients under 18 years of age , the surface of the surface may not exceed 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient talks about the treatment after two or three days , the physician should study the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial reef ( the parts of the bacterial cells to be produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
&quot; major indication of the effectiveness has occurred in all five studies of the share of patients , whose infection was fl@@ ash@@ amed after the end of treatment . &quot;
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.3 % ) of 71 patients below plac@@ ebo spoke on treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected back@@ ups , Al@@ tar@@ go and Cef@@ al@@ ysts expressed similar response : if the results of both studies were taken together at home @-@ wo@@ unds , about 90 % of the patients of both groups spoke on the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , found that Al@@ tar@@ go has been caused in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( v@@ ain hol@@ low in the body tissues ) or by infections that were veri@@ fiable or presum@@ ably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed between 1 and 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation on the order .
&quot; the committee for human therapeutic products ( CH@@ MP ) stri@@ ves to conclude that the advantages of al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ line treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections in opposite to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • in@@ gest@@ ed small la@@ undering , di@@ ced or se@@ wn wo@@ unds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission shared the G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a licence for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union . &quot;
patients in which there are no improvement within two to three days are to be examined even once and to consider an alternative therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the event of awareness or serious local irrit@@ ation through the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in sal@@ be , the treatment was abandoned , the sal@@ ts should be carefully scru@@ pul@@ ously and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection can be started . &quot;
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as infectious or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
clinical trials in clinical trials at secondary wound was the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in in patients with infections that were caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in resist@@ ent St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
&quot; an alternative therapy is to be considered , if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected body occurs . &quot;
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ cent@@ ric , who were obtained from human beings after top@@ ical application in di@@ ced skin or infected super@@ ficial wo@@ unds , is a clin@@ ically relevant im@@ itation in vi@@ vo not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 By simultaneous storage of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the middle Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in sal@@ ts on por@@ ic skin from healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dosage adjustment is not required if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in used during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a Re@@ productive Tox@@ icity after oral intake and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the f@@ öt@@ ale / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
&quot; ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in Sal@@ be should be applied only during pregnancy , when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indic@@ ative and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in the gift of a system@@ ic antibiotic . &quot;
&quot; when deciding whether the breast@@ feeding has gone / completed , or the therapy with al@@ tar@@ go should continue , is between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ gling and the benefit of the al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go have applied , the most common reported ann@@ ex@@ ation of the schedule , which looked around 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; roughly Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of Pl@@ euro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is pass@@ able via fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ ag@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Pl@@ ur@@ ot@@ us Pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the function mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in is based on selective im@@ itation of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction with a specific bond of the 50@@ s sub@@ unit of the bacter@@ i@@ ual Ri@@ bos@@ oms which differs from the bonds of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the Bin@@ ding @-@ Bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ Bin@@ ding station and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ as@@ e@@ Centre .
&quot; by bin@@ ge on this bin@@ ational point inhibit@@ ors Pl@@ euro@@ cour@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , blocking partially P @-@ application interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; should be focused on the basis of local prevalence of res@@ ili@@ ence , the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in at least some infectious forms should be focused , a consultation by experts should be pursued . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the in @-@ vit@@ ro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in towards S.@@ p.@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the insul@@ ates are sensitive and resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used for the protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases that concern the liver ) in children between one and 15 years that are not im@@ mu@@ n against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix will be applied within two doses of existing vaccines , whereby one protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used when the immun@@ isation is a low risk of a Hepatitis B infection and it is ensured that the vaccine has led to the end of two doses . &quot;
if a refres@@ her dose against hepatitis A or B is desired can be given Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis A@@ - or B vaccine .
&quot; vaccines work by bringing the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , &quot; as it can impose on a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the immune system and surface anti@@ gens . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the vacc@@ inated vaccine Twin@@ rix adults and the since 1997 approved healthcare Twin@@ rix children .
&quot; the three vaccines have been used for protection against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children administ@@ ered under one of three doses of the existing vaccines . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults identical ingredients , some of the data , which use the application of Twin@@ rix adults also used as proof of the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indi@@ an for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed one month after the last inj@@ ecting a protective anti@@ body con@@ centr@@ alised .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with an six@@ teen @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix led children between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last inj@@ ecting in the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix had a h@@ edge and a 12 @-@ month gap between inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccines ) are head@@ ache , appetite , sor@@ eness to the inj@@ ecting , redness , matri@@ mon@@ iness ( ti@@ redness ) and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may not be hyper@@ sensitive to patients who may not be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) not to be applied .
August 2002 shared the European Commission of the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals . a permit for approval by Ambi@@ rix in the entire region
&quot; the standardization plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ in@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose is administ@@ ered at the appointment of the election and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her , for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B , may be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ ular vaccines or with a combination vaccine . &quot;
the anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis C ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ H@@ AV @-@ A @-@ virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti@@ body values lie in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ aries vaccine .
&quot; it is still not fully backed whether immun@@ o @-@ competent individuals , which are addressed on a hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination , as they need to be protected as protection , since they are also protected by no longer read@@ able antibodies through the immun@@ ologic memory . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all inj@@ ections , for the rare case of an an@@ aphy@@ si@@ ac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and supervision should always be available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardization is recommended with the combination that is the 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ active hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B @-@ surface . &quot;
&quot; for hem@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , according to the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ ul@@ arization , under certain circumstances there is no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies , so in these cases the gift may require further vaccines . &quot;
&quot; as an in@@ tra@@ der@@ mal inj@@ ecting or in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular administration could lead to a subtle imp@@ ending success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ectable by Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or ble@@ eding disorders , however , because in these cases it may occur after in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular gift . &quot;
when Ambi@@ rix in the second life year in the form of a separate inj@@ ecting crane ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined Mas@@ ern@@ - M@@ illing disease vaccine administ@@ ered was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective must be assumed that there is no sufficient immune response .
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ination of this formulation in adults was the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , matri@@ mon@@ y , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ic tis , head@@ aches and fever comparable to the incidence which was observed in the earlier Thi@@ om@@ ers@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative vaccine . &quot;
in clinical studies 2029 vacc@@ d@@ osen Ambi@@ rix had been administ@@ ered at a total of 10@@ 27 vaccine at the age of 1 to 15 .
in a study of 300 people aged 12 to 15 and 15 years the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix compared with the 3 @-@ bit combination mechanism .
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and matri@@ mon@@ y on a comp@@ uted basis per vaccine d@@ osis Ambi@@ rix , but not on a comp@@ utation basis per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0,@@ 7 % of the students , compared with 39,@@ 1 % in the test @-@ making of a dose of the 3 @-@ bit combination . &quot;
&quot; after the full vacc@@ cycle 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the test students , the Ambi@@ rix had been administ@@ ered over pain , compared to 6@@ 3,@@ 8 % with the pros that have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ tin @-@ combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of matri@@ arch was comparable ( i.e. above all the vacc@@ cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of the doctoral students , the Ambi@@ rix had compared with 36.@@ 2 % among the pros which received the 3 @-@ doses @-@ combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; the prevalence of pre@@ dil@@ ation , and matri@@ mon@@ y was small and comparable that was observed after the administration of the combination @-@ vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses of the vaccine . &quot;
in a compar@@ ative study at 1- until 11 @-@ year imp@@ ed@@ ingen was the occurrence of local actions and general practi@@ tioners in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group comparable to that which was observed in administration with the 3 @-@ doses @-@ combination @-@ in@@ active hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B @-@ surface .
&quot; at the 6@@ - until 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix had a common appearance of pain ( an injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band . &quot;
the share of imp@@ ed@@ ingen that schem@@ atic over serious side @-@ effects during the 2 @-@ doses Peri@@ od with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses of vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ active hepatitis @-@ B@@ - ( surface areas ) was statisti@@ cally different .
&quot; clinical trials which were conducted at imp@@ ed@@ ingen at the age of 1 to 15 , the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ al rates of Anti @-@ H@@ AV 99@@ ,@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for the month 6 cancelled dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ al rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4,@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for the month 6 cancelled dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a compar@@ ative study , which was carried out at 12@@ - until and including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two doses Ambi@@ rix and 147 were performed as elementary combination with three doses . &quot;
&quot; for the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity was ex@@ chang@@ able , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to G@@ etting of the 3 @-@ tin protocol was significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which in a clinical compar@@ ative study at 1 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old one month after the end of the full vacc@@ ination ( i.e. in month 7 ) were achieved , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ ination was either a 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ active hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hepatitis B @-@ surface .
people who were old at the time of the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ ul@@ arization between 12 and 15 years old could the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies to be detected at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation at Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vaccine .
the immun@@ isation of the study observed in this study was comparable to that after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ active hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B @-@ surface in a dose of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - until 15 @-@ year @-@ old could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vaccine .

&quot; the hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus is usually transmitted by viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other routes , such as by bathing in by dra@@ inage waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark blue , a blu@@ ish face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ lowing ) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix can not be completely protected before an infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus , even if the full vacc@@ ination has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child are infected before the administration of both vacc@@ inated Ambi@@ rix had already infected with hepatitis C or hepatitis B or hepatitis B ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill / feels ) a vaccine might not prevent disorder .
&quot; protection against other infections that cause the liver damage or symptoms that are similar to those of a hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection , can not be convey@@ ed . &quot;
• If you have shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express itself by ju@@ ck@@ end rash , respir@@ atory or swelling of the face or tongue . • if with you / your child has occurred an allergic reaction to a previous vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • if you have a serious infection with fever . &quot;
&quot; • If you want to quickly have protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and before the planned administration of the second vacc@@ ination ) . &quot;
with a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccine with Ambi@@ rix .
instead it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis A@@ - / hepatitis B @-@ B vaccine with a decreased content ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ active hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B @-@ surface .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with decreased content is commonly administ@@ ered a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ination before ter@@ mination of the vacc@@ ination .
&quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ rix will suffer from severe blood cl@@ ine dis@@ rup@@ tions under the skin and not in the muscle tissue . • if you are weak@@ ened in your child because of a disease or treatment in your / its body &apos;s body . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases but the immune response to these persons can not be sufficient so a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 sc@@ ales your doctor if you can take additional medicines for your child ( including those that you have been able to have without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated with / or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or if you have planned or this in the near future .
&quot; however , it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limb@@ s .
&quot; if ambient rix should be administ@@ ered at the same time or just before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be adequate . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix will not be administ@@ ered pregnant or nursing women unless it is necessary to vacc@@ inated for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 to 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data , which has become known since issu@@ ing the first approval for the in@@ duc@@ tions , the CH@@ MP opinion that the benefits @-@ risk for Ambi@@ rix will remain positive . &quot;
&quot; however , Ambi@@ rix had only been brought into circulation only in one Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this drug is limited because of low patient exposure . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over one month with a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ phen@@ ol , or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ical En@@ sur@@ op@@ athy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ium concentration ) in the pre @-@ history . &quot;
Am@@ mon@@ aps is seed@@ ed - split by several individual to the meals - swal@@ lowed under the food mixed or over a guest @-@ stom@@ p@@ esh@@ ly ( through the abdom@@ inal ceiling in the stomach of the stomach ) or a nas@@ al son@@ de ( through the nose in the stomach leading hose ) .
&quot; it was not a compar@@ ative study , since Am@@ mon@@ ster could not be compared with any other treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a s@@ ular medicine , i.e. without any substance ) . &quot;
&quot; am@@ end may also cause loss of loss , an ab@@ normal ac@@ idity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ aches , impotence , dis@@ ation , nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , sickness , ob@@ struction , rash , uncomfortable body cur@@ se or weight gain . &quot;
the committee for human therapeutic products ( CH@@ MP ) stri@@ pped at the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ aps must be effectively prevented in patients with disorders of the ure@@ th@@ ane cycle .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was authorised under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; because of the rar@@ ity of the condition at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine . &quot;
the use is indi@@ visible in all patients where a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ es@@ man has already manifest@@ ed itself in the new@@ born age ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late t@@ end@@ t@@ firm form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ defect ) consists of an indication for the use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese is a hyper@@ op@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ op@@ athy .
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with fl@@ atter@@ ing , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ule form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated assum@@ ing the protein intoler@@ ance and for the growth and development of the daily protein intake of the patient .
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose is so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as for up @-@ to @-@ growing and adult . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from an early lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ ep@@ dro@@ scar@@ ec@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or Ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
patients with an Ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must have Ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets should not be administ@@ ered patients with lo@@ ops , since a risk to the emergence of eco @-@ soph@@ ie exists when the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
each tablet AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium in accordance with 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at which is the maximum daily dose .
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ sti@@ lled heart failure or severe gall@@ in@@ suff@@ iciency , as well as with Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ re@@ ten@@ tion and Ö@@ de@@ ff@@ lement schemes , only with caution . &quot;
&quot; because Met@@ abol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ at about the liver and the kid@@ neys , should be applied AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS in patients with liver or ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency only with extreme caution . &quot;
the importance of these results concerning pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contr@@ ain@@ dicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; at subtle flavors of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at young r@@ ts in high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; it also found an increased irrit@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses , and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth . &quot;
&quot; it could not be noticed whether Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is exploited in humans into the breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is contr@@ ain@@ dicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS came at 56 % of patients at least an unwanted event ( AE ) on and at 78 % of these undes@@ irable events that they were not connected with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very common ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; prob@@ able toxic response to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old anor@@ tic patient , which developed a met@@ abolic enc@@ ephal@@ op@@ athy in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ rot@@ um , vit@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , vit@@ amine N@@ europ@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of an over@@ dose joined in a 5 month old child @-@ child with an acci@@ d dose of 10 grams ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate that showed a intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dose @-@ limited neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity .
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic @-@ active connection , performed by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ yl@@ yl glut@@ amine , which is connected via the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; pus@@ h@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally , Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ meth@@ yl@@ amine is comparable with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ meth@@ yl@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative support to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus nit@@ rogen . &quot;
5 patients with distur@@ b@@ ances of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram taken so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ at between 0.12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ yl@@ meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ yl @-@ nit@@ rogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment can be started immediately to improve the chances of survival and the clinical result .
&quot; the progn@@ osis of the early detection of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in the new@@ born age was almost always inf@@ ecting , and the disease led themselves to the treatment with Per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ se and essential amino acids , or their stu@@ d @-@ free analog@@ y within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; by hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nit@@ rogen emissions ( so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate , so@@ dium and natural sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to diagnose the survival rate of new@@ born in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life @-@ life ) of disease on 80 % . &quot;
patients whose disease has been diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and the survival rate was 100 % before the first appearance of a hyper@@ op@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ op@@ athy , but even with these patients there was time with many of spiritual disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ fold form of disorder ( including feminine patients with the heter@@ ozy@@ g@@ ous form of the Or@@ ni@@ th@@ eses Bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ op@@ ic endo@@ cr@@ in@@ op@@ ric and a prot@@ ein@@ izing diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
existing neurological defic@@ its are also hardly rever@@ sible in treatment and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition .
&quot; it is known that Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at has been ox@@ i@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ red in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ meth@@ yl@@ amine arises . &quot;
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its Met@@ abol@@ ites in Plas@@ ma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ at in so@@ ber metabolism and with liver cir@@ rh@@ age from up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its Met@@ abol@@ ites were also studied in cancer patients based on intraven@@ ous goods and phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a oral dose of 5 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ at in tablet form were fixed 15 minutes after taking measurable plas@@ tic@@ at concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
in the majority of patients with hydrogen cy@@ ber group@@ ings or hem@@ ost@@ bin@@ aries ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after night @-@ specific fasting no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plas@@ ma .
&quot; for three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three cardboard ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ amin@@ ates on the third day was five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is dischar@@ ged within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ li@@ fied product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ meth@@ yl@@ amine by the kid@@ neys .

&quot; angi@@ ox is applied to the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ dis@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood flow to the heart ) , for example , in inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of p@@ ains in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dinal ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ er &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measuring value at the electro@@ cardi@@ og@@ ram or E@@ KG ) . &quot;
&quot; will be applied by det@@ ox for preventing blood cl@@ ots in patients that elev@@ ate itself to a PCI , a higher dose is administ@@ ered and the inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack on maintaining blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect from An@@ gi@@ ox in all@@ ot@@ or II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine to prevent cl@@ ashes with Hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI was compared . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI slot , the patients were frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tube ) used in the arter@@ ies to prevent a closure ) and they received additional medicines to prevent cl@@ auses , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of G@@ PI - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart waste or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who subjected itself to a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective as Hep@@ arin , except for heavy ble@@ eding on which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin . &quot;
angi@@ ox must not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other hierarchy or any other components . &quot;
&quot; it must not be used in patients who recently had an blood@@ shed , as well as in people with heavy hyper@@ tension or serious kidney disease or a cardi@@ ac infection . &quot;
the committee for human therapeutic products ( CH@@ MP ) have concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI a acceptable substitute for Hep@@ arin is .
September 2004 divided the European Commission to the Company The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd .
to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ in@@ syn@@ dro@@ ms ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ le@@ verage in@@ far@@ es ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) with an emergency access or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bol@@ ts of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is carried out in another result , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the surgery to 1,75 mg / kg / h should be increased . &quot;
after PCI may be resum@@ ed the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
&quot; immediately prior to the procedure , a serial number of 0.5 mg / kg should be administ@@ ered by an inf@@ usion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery . &quot;
the recommended dosage of an@@ ox@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of a initi@@ ating intraven@@ ous bol@@ ts of 0,75 mg / kg body weight and one directly subsequent intraven@@ ous Inf@@ usion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and effectiveness of an all@@ ot@@ ting bol@@ ts of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shorten@@ ed at 225 seconds , should be a second bolt of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the appearance of low ACT &apos;s values , the reproductive and dil@@ uted medicines should be me@@ tic@@ ously mixed and administ@@ ered by the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1,75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is properly administ@@ ered . &quot;
in case of patients with medium @-@ heavy kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) that are subjected to a PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) should be used a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1,@@ 4 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; lies the ACT value below 225 seconds , is a second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg administ@@ ered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dosage . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which resulted in the Phase II I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which led to the authorisation , the ACT value 5 minutes to the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at an average 36@@ 6 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients is angi@@ ox @-@ trained ( see below paragraph 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox may be introduced 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous G@@ goods by un@@ frozen Hep@@ arin or 8 hours after the completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of G@@ ari@@ em Hep@@ arin .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredients or any other ingredients or against mill@@ en@@ ine • active hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age or increased blood risks . • heavy un@@ controll@@ able hyper@@ tension and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible fr@@ ame@@ functions . • severe kidney disease ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a ble@@ eding especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administ@@ ered in combination with another anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if in PCI @-@ patients with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ to occur in most ble@@ eding in arter@@ ial points , can occur in patients suffering from a per@@ k@@ ut@@ aneous Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) , during the treatment of principle everywhere ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a monitoring of the IN@@ R Wer@@ ts ( International Nor@@ mal@@ ised Rati@@ o ) should be considered to ensure that the value of treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in should be able to achieve existing level before the treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge of the structure of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tica or Th@@ ro@@ ism aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these substances may increase blood danger . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with Th@@ ro@@ el@@ aggreg@@ ation aggreg@@ ation or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological membrane @-@ parameters are regularly monitored in each case . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children over six years with diabetes , which need treatment with insul@@ in . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) to the abdom@@ inal wall that in@@ jects the upper arm or the upper arm or as a permanent inf@@ usion with a insul@@ in pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insul@@ in to control the gl@@ uc@@ ose of gl@@ uc@@ ose ( sugar ) in the blood or to process insul@@ in .
&quot; insul@@ in insul@@ in is very slightly different from human insul@@ in , and the change means that it affects faster and has a shorter operating time than a short @-@ effective human insul@@ in . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with an effective insul@@ in in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body can produce no insul@@ in in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
&quot; type 2 diabetes , in which the body insul@@ in insul@@ in can not be effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was investigated in a study of 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the effectiveness was the change of concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes , after six months a reduction of 0.7 % ( 7.6 % ) was fixed compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insul@@ in insul@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was reduced % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0,30 % in human gene@@ tically insul@@ in . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other ingredients or in patients who suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must be customized when it is administ@@ ered along with a number of other medicines that may affect the blood @-@ glu@@ cos@@ al level .
September 2004 divided the European Commission to the company San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH to appro@@ ve A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdom@@ inal ceiling , the upper sh@@ ank or del@@ c@@ ut@@ aneous through continuous inf@@ usion into the area of the abdom@@ inal prints . &quot;
&quot; due to the decreased gl@@ uc@@ ose capacity and the dimin@@ ishing insul@@ in insul@@ ator , the insul@@ in need for patients with a restriction of the liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the active product , the brand ( wire ) , insul@@ in insul@@ as ( normal , N@@ PH , galvan@@ k@@ delays etc. ) , the type of insul@@ in ( animal insul@@ in ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the need of insul@@ in demand . &quot;
&quot; 3 A lack of insufficient dosage or dismant@@ ling of treatment , especially in patients with a insul@@ in @-@ paying diabetes , can cause a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and an di@@ ab@@ etic K@@ eto@@ acid ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
switching from one patient to another insul@@ in type or insul@@ in a different vend@@ or should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may make a change of dosage .
the time of occurrence of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the substance profile of the used insul@@ in and can therefore change when changing the treatment schem@@ as .
&quot; to increase the substances that increase the ble@@ eding activity and increase the incl@@ ination to Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ Con@@ ver@@ ting @-@ enzy@@ mes ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mon@@ o@@ amine oxid@@ ants , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , pro@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ ph@@ an@@ ide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ etic acts like bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , Guan@@ ac@@ id@@ ine and reserves the symptoms of the ep@@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ ag@@ le counter@@ parts might be deter@@ red or missing . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies on reproduction x@@ icity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ in and human insul@@ in in regard to pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insul@@ in enters into the human mother &apos;s milk , but in general insul@@ in is not res@@ or@@ ted into the mother &apos;s milk , nor will it res@@ or@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; in the following are the results listed from clinical trials , group@@ ed according to system organs ( very often : &gt; 1 / 100 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally : &gt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency on the basis of availability ) . &quot;
&quot; cold @-@ welding , bold , and p@@ asse skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or weakness , anxiety , unusual Er@@ - creation or weakness , confusion , aff@@ li@@ ction , excessive ache , nau@@ sea , nau@@ sea and heart @-@ t@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y Wir@@ d fails to change the inj@@ ame within the inj@@ ector range , in the episode a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y can occur in the inj@@ ecting location . &quot;
severe hy@@ po@@ gly@@ cem@@ ies with awareness can be given by means of in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) that will be given by a trained person or treated by intraven@@ ous gift from gl@@ uc@@ ose by a doctor .
&quot; according to a gl@@ uc@@ tance , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine thing for the severe hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insul@@ in lowers the blood sugar levels by the stimulation of the periph@@ eral gl@@ uc@@ ose ( especially by skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by the im@@ itation of glu@@ cos@@ ity production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes demonstrated that during sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ iters of insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in der efficiency is done faster and the duration of duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ mal@@ ine @-@ insul@@ in .
&quot; in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes @-@ diabetes &apos; tus showed insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in therapeu@@ tically relevant control area of 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg for a dis@@ proportionate increase in the glu@@ ant effect , just like Human@@ insul@@ in . &quot;
insul@@ in insul@@ in has twice as fast as fast as norm@@ alised human insul@@ in and achiev@@ es the full @-@ glu@@ ing effect approximately 2 hours earlier than the human @-@ insul@@ in .
&quot; from the data was obvious that in an application of insul@@ in insul@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ quit@@ ous gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved , as with human@@ istic Nor@@ mal @-@ insul@@ in , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insul@@ in in 2 minutes before the meal has been restored , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ ate control was achieved as with human@@ istic Nor@@ mal @-@ insul@@ in , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; in 15 minutes insul@@ in is wast@@ ed in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control , such as human@@ ized Nor@@ mal @-@ insul@@ in , which is given 2 Mi@@ - nu@@ ances before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insul@@ in insul@@ in at G@@ etting 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal in comparison to human@@ istic Nor@@ mal @-@ insul@@ in , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1A ) , as well as compared to human@@ istic Nor@@ mal @-@ insul@@ in , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; insul@@ in insul@@ in at G@@ ables 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after ) after the start of the meal in comparison to human@@ istic Nor@@ mal @-@ insul@@ in , which was 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) . &quot;
