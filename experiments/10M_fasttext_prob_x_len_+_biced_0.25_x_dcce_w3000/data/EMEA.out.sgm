<seg id="6">Insfy is used to treat severe severe severe episodes and prevention of manic episodes in patients suffering from the past to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection-solution is used for quick control of increased intruism or behavioural disorders when the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both conditions, the solution can be applied to the one or the melting-coated tablets in patients, those strolling of tablets difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who are simultaneously interfere with other medicines that are to be dismantled, the dose of bilify should be adapted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances, which allow communication of nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripipelzole probably appears above all as a "partial Agonist" for the neurotransmitters Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprawns, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in a slight extent than the neurotransmitters acts to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, the activity of the brain contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, thus reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and it will be prevented."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of bilify, to prevent the re-emergence of the symptoms, was examined in three studies by up to a year."</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injurious solution was compared in two studies with 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases resulting in increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify over twelve weeks of 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study had stabilized the effectiveness of bilify and placebo, to prevent re-occur in 160 patients in which the manic symptoms have already been stabilised with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of bilify injections was carried out in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that compared to increased disquities with the by Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies the change in the symptoms of patients based on a standard skala for bipolar disorder or the number of patients, which spoke to the treatment mentioned."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the company also led studies by examining the body, how the body converts the melting-coated tablets and the solution to initiate."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection-solution patients, the bilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg received, a significant increase in symptoms of increased intruism than the patients who received a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder sufferers by bilify in four of the five short-term studies manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Furnisfy it also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the re-recurrent sleek episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Bilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similar effective as Lorazepam.</seg>

<seg id="25">"the committee for human therapeutic products (CHMP) strives to conclude that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia, as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mostly manical episodes and in which the manic episodes spoke to the treatment with Aripiprazole, opposite the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the Committee came to the result, that the advantages of injecting anxiety in the fast control of increased unrest and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia, or in patients with some episodes of bipolarisation, if a oral therapy is not suitable to predominate the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004 also shared the European Commission of Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Limited Ltd. a licence for marketing integration by Abilify throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is used for the treatment of moderate to severe manical episodes of the Bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mostly manical episodes and their manical episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of the meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"an increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as secondary or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolarised disorder in patients &gt; 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient population, a lower initialous dose should be considered, if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4-Rector is set out from the combination therapy, the Aripipelzole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">The appearance of suicide behaviour belongs to mental illness and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of anti-psychotic therapy (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder no increased additive risk with Aripizole in comparison to other antipsychotic medicines.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripizole should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardinous diseases), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions, which are used for hypotony (dehydration, hypocrine, treatment with bleeding drugs) or hypertension (including acute and maligne form)."</seg>

<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripipelzole on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripizole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally-effective medicines such as starvation (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2-antagonist Famotidine, a stomach acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripipelzole, with this effect however as clinically is not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers, increased a highly effective CYP2D6-Inhibitor (Chinese) the AUC of Aripijole around 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children over six years with diabetes, which need treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) to the abdominal wall that injects the upper arm or the upper arm or as a permanent infusion with a insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to control the glucose of glucose (sugar) in the blood or to process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">"insulin insulin is very slightly different from human insulin, and the change means that it affects faster and has a shorter operating time than a short-effective human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with an effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body can produce no insulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">"type 2 diabetes, in which the body insulin insulin can not be effective, Apidra was investigated in a study of 878 adults."</seg>
