&quot; the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of the kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier available . &quot;
more information about the use of corporate quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual too &amp; quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions .... lets you select the card card tools and choose the desired modules . &quot;
&quot; this is a list of standard modules included in the package C@@ de ; add @-@ ons . please note that any more modules are installed on your system , in case you have installed additional software . &quot;
&quot; you should install the par@@ ad@@ base package , which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; includes before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in the Con@@ quer@@ or ; on extras you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of cr@@ ashes , if available , delete . &quot;
the module review filter ( also called folder filter ) can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under extras
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use Extr@@ as DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document . as default , the display starts with the root mark@@ er of the document , example : cap@@ ita , all the other k@@ not are sub@@ elements of this root h@@ ubs . &quot;
&quot; the module &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view of objects with the M@@ IME type I@@ node / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbols and text views , in order to view the content of your local fil@@ es@@ ystem . &quot;
&quot; the speci@@ ality of &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; consists in it , wel@@ ded folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map graf@@ ic structures . each object is proportionate to its size . this size must be the property that the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordinate objects of a object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; F@@ S@@ view ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries is specified in it . thus , large files , even if it can be seen far down in the folder hierarchy . thus , it can be seen far down in the folder of the folder . thus , it can be seen as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; -@@ command &apos;s command . &quot;
in &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ vor representation a rect@@ angle that represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ es@@ ystem . for simple navigation possess the right @-@ edge useful h@@ edge and labelling settings .
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is placed in view page mode , can either represent depth for the light detection of the prescri@@ ptions or the figure of a different file property such as name , owner , group or m@@ ime type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different characteristics of the corresponding file or folder . for each property you can specify if it is displayed at all , only when enough space to represent is present or whether the surface of sub@@ ordinate legislation is to occur ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; on display algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be adher@@ ed to that the surface is proportionate to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ port@@ in &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; this goal is not always adher@@ ed to . it will be frame that the sub@@ ordinate entries is no longer available . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square . &quot;
&quot; like sharing of the area of an entry for the sub@@ ordinate messages , the implementation will be left to implementation . here it is necessary for the cr@@ acking and avoidance of space lu@@ cr@@ ates through frames , that remedies are created that are as square as possible . the best methods for this are lines , columns or recur@@ sive power . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum set area for an entry over the menu entry view . instead , a space pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ or@@ derly agreement to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; F@@ S@@ view was originally designed as a small test application and introduction into the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets which was developed for application K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind . &quot;
the module &apos;s picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under extras @-@ picture gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .

&quot; an easy to use camera lens may be provided to you with your digital camera , so that you can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ tization ; of course , every medium and every ticket y@@ les@@ see is supported by your operating system , which is supported by your operating system ; working together . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization has come ; contains a fast image processing with basic training tools . you can use these to evaluate and correct your photos , commented , jud@@ ging and correct . the editing capacity can be easily expanded with KDE image plug @-@ ins interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; Go came ; easy to use , it provides du@@ ous professional abilities available . it works fully in 16 @-@ bit Far@@ br@@ aum . it works fully in 16 @-@ bit Far@@ br@@ aum and all available modules support the raw material by li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G @-@ Export and ICC @-@ color @-@ management . &quot;
&quot; improved database with significantly more met@@ ad@@ ata , such as the camera or the lens , which can be looked for . &quot;
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ tization ; an open source project . this means it is on supporting the end users . you should therefore report problems and improvement possibilities .
&quot; when you get involved in the program , the Help menu includes a listing of problems or wishes for them . wherever you use this link , your navig@@ ator will open a page in the error system . all necessary information is already registered here . follow the instructions to submit your report . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s a project that is supported by a community . that is , the user and developers arrived to each other . if you like a regular user of &amp; digi@@ tization ; then we would like to answer any questions about other users of &amp; digi@@ tization . in this mailing list , you can answer any questions about other users . in this mailing list , you should answer this language so powerful . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ tization ; homepage visit to learn news about the given versions and other information about &amp; getting ; to learn .
&quot; the best start to get involved &amp; checking ; to participate , the registration is in the developer mailing list . guide to login in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; when you come ; for the first time you start , you will be wondering where you specify your pictures and your database . you can select a local , remote or remote folder . just enter the folder icon or click the folder folder icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field you must specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data will be saved . this path remains the same for all the pictures . &quot;
later you can add as many folder as you would like . &amp; digi@@ tised ; will you use in addition as an Al@@ ben@@ Library . settings digi@@ tization .
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the highest folder , the pictures , as ground@@ ed folder , considers every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . during the search of the folder you &apos;ll get a progress report like this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ tization ; dur@@ o was searching for the libr@@ arian in all of its depth . you can not match a sub@@ folder , unless it is i@@ ste in hidden folder . you can insert it completely , you can insert a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take a existing folder with photos as base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list will have no photos as symbols . you can change that by clicking any photo from the album , and this is then used as an album symbol . further details can be found in the section albums . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up in &amp; nbsp ; your digital camera setup . after that , you should learn how to manage My albums and My keywords in order to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw material support : in case you use the raw code of your camera , so you can handle it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the help of raw material support . &quot;
how to set up and work with raw files in the de@@ parts of Ro@@ h Dec@@ o@@ der@@ settings and ro@@ h work@@ flow .
&quot; an easy to use camera lens may be provided to you with your digital camera , so that you can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ tization ; of course , every medium and every ticket y@@ les@@ see is supported by your operating system , which is supported by your operating system ; working together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera appears to be realised as a USB mass storage device . the camera can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras will also use the seri@@ alization port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; program came up ; used the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital cameras , which has been developing a constantly growing number of more than 800 cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to machines and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transmission , this connection has become out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ tization also supports these cameras and leads the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras will be found under this link . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ pi@@ f support , so that the visu@@ als of digi@@ tization of digi@@ ti@@ sts are needed to read the sub@@ directories from a number of lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 @-@ camera operators , you will notice correctly , or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things came to you ; is how easy to expand its functionality by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE image plug @-@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common modul@@ structure for &amp; digi@@ tization ; it is the aim of developing the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it also allows a user . their advantage is that it &apos;s much easier to complement a function when writing a small module to complement a function when the changes came up &amp; checking ; even to perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either move the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full screen mode with F@@ 11 and C@@ tr@@ l + f . &quot;
&quot; drawing and drawing from images works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ma , across the horizontal separation line or into another application window . the only constra@@ int is that a picture is not in keywords , fil@@ um@@ sli@@ est or su@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; - a file selection enables you to lift the most common : JP@@ EG , P@@ NG , T@@ IF@@ F , Ro@@ w , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for fields that are displayed in the tool@@ window currently . thus , filter@@ ing on the fil@@ en@@ ame can also be displayed . which fields can be displayed in the dialog box settings . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo ads . all photos that were saved by &amp; digi@@ tization , in which they were stored on the hard disk , according to the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ properties or after the date , where the album was first created , the date may change in the characteristics of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have a scanner set up , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also select a screens@@ hot directly to one album . select album Im@@ por@@ in screens@@ hot . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move the picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop there . in the then appearing menu , you will have to move the picture by moving or copying . just choose all the photos and move it to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album includes a collection of photos and the album properties , to give you information about this collection . to access the album properties , click on the album and select in the context menu Alb@@ um@@ Properties menu . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - Coll@@ ections : are a method to highlight your albums , so that you can select your photos by selecting from the tool@@ bar or view albums by collection . if you want to add new collections or remove new collections . if you want to add new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections . &quot;
the album date : will be used if you sort your albums on date with view albums sort by date .
&quot; buttons El@@ t@@ ester , average , new : these put the date on the one of the oldest , the latest image or the passage of the album . it is first tries to calculate the average of images out of their EX@@ IF data . if this fails , instead the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first came to an album , first , the first image appears as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; selected . this should help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes , the first photo of the album is not representative , and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu . additionally , select the photo on the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be only included in a collection and coll@@ ars can be p@@ oured out .
&amp; nbsp ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area M@@ oul@@ Stich@@ ting list on top of the main window . album coll@@ collections have another effect . the collection always includes all the photos of the album . of course you can use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the picture window will provide you with the main view of your photos . when you select an album , all pictures are displayed in this album in the picture window . each photo will display in a preview , you can adjust the size of this presentation with the two th@@ el@@ ons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album the first time you will just wait , while the re@@ umb@@ nails will be generated . this can avoid them in which you can extract records in the menu View all screen@@ shots . &quot;
&quot; information on each picture is displayed below the corresponding preview . which information is , you can change about settings ; set up the albums page and adjust the section called &quot; &quot; Th@@ umb@@ nails &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Th@@ umb@@ nails disp@@ ers@@ ed via Hil@@ fe@@ ather window , the appearing c@@ ursor over the mouse . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screens@@ hot above in the section introduction into the main window indicates a such aid window . &quot;
photos are all what came with &amp; digi@@ tization ; works . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . you can get all the features that come with &amp; digi@@ tization ; possible to browse the context menu of the images , a sli@@ deshow or the editing of images . &quot;
you can view the picture editing with a photo by clicking on either F@@ 4 picture ... or the context menu of the picture with the right mouse button . editing a guide on how to edit your photos . with picture editing you can view your photos and change them .
&quot; it can occur that &amp; digi@@ tization has come ; the functionality you need is not available . you can easily open a photo in another program by clicking the context menu with the right mouse button , and how to custom@@ ize this your needs when your program is not en@@ umer@@ ated , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that after processing by other image processing programs can come to problems with the data contained in the picture . some programs do not store this data with the data contained in the picture . thus , this information will be saved from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , bl@@ ending etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; nbsp ; provides two ways of setting you . the simpl@@ est thing is to click with the right mouse button , click on the Pre@@ view to select . in the sub @-@ menu you can indicate the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the fil@@ en@@ ames of a photo , you can click with the right mouse button on the preview and F2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you keep the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you come a photo of &amp; digi@@ tization ; delete , it will be del@@ ayed in the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer of &amp; k@@ de ; if you don &apos;t really want to delete it , you can use this by going down ; de@@ f . &quot;
&quot; the view &quot; &quot; My fil@@ um@@ sli@@ p@@ quot ; organized your photos from the data . &amp; digi@@ tised , used for this either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; when selecting a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the data sheet in the file view , so that you will only be shown the photos of the selected days . &quot;
photos with Stich@@ ting provided a flexible and powerful possibility to organise and catalogue your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers to be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a key@@ word can be assigned to a photo , the photo may be found by selecting this sampling or a search . &quot;
&quot; when a key@@ word is selected , all the photos used with this key@@ word are displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . here you can organize your keywords log@@ ically . you can also cr@@ ashes parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords , so that you can find the keywords which you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and used keywords in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JP@@ EG , stored . you can also import your keywords in loss of the database re @-@ imported as soon as you noticed ; the pictures noticed . &quot;
&quot; you can add new words by clicking with the right mouse button , either on &amp; quot ; My Stich@@ ting quot ; or on an existing key@@ word click . if you have a new key@@ word after you click on an existing point , this is the key@@ word of this keywords . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word using the right mouse button and delete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not delete . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a keywords by moving it to the desired position in the tree and drop there . then a menu that gives you the possibility to access the key@@ word . a key@@ word can be a time only once in the tree .
&quot; you can change the properties of a keywords by selecting it with the right mouse button and click in the context menu . you can change the name of the keywords , and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My Stich@@ ting quot ; change . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu As Alb@@ um@@ pres@@ schau . additionally , you can drag the photo on the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use this feature . this can be done on two ways : once you have chosen the photos , you can click on the appropriate key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; you can also click on the appropriate mouse button on the viewing of the images and select from the context menu item key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can select a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will display , once you choose one of the keywords used to him . in this way you can select an keywords for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event in which it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with Stich@@ ting , this is displayed under the preview of the picture in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a key@@ word , in which you can click with the right mouse @-@ menu of the photo and select from the keywords menu . the menu shows you only the keywords which have been assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ based hist@@ og@@ ram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can click over this hist@@ og@@ ram . to select a time frame , all associated images are shown in the main window . &quot;
in the field below you can type one title and save your selection . it then appears in the list below .
&quot; cover all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamp and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; off Sear@@ ch@@ box is a small lamp that becomes green if the search results . when you click here , the filter@@ ing is deleted and all the pictures are shown again . if the search was not found , then the lamp is red . &quot;
&quot; the advanced search tool is hidden in the rider on the left side bar with the bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this , you &apos;ll find a simple search box as described above . you can read this search here as a search crit@@ erion . after you saved the fil@@ tered filter at the list . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be executed . the results will be displayed in a search list in the main window . if you want to choose your selection after search again , you just have to select the corresponding entry from the view of a search list and select a option in his context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you choose to edit information , the application will be displayed again with the previous search information . if you choose to edit an advanced search , the dialog will be available to search for your previous search . more information can be found in the section The tool for Ex@@ tended Search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select in the context @-@ context menu . &quot;
&quot; Ex@@ tended Search will provide you an extended search form with many search parameters , by which you came in specific fields of &amp; digi@@ tization ; s database can be found . &quot;
&quot; the list of the search rules will be used to set the options for a search query in the Alb@@ end@@ at@@ database . any option can be added with others about the logical operations all ... , One ... , No ... or at least ... link . furthermore , you can create searches of the type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tised each picture by a long figure with a special technique , the hair algorith@@ m . this allows it to compare images by compar@@ ing these sig@@ natur@@ es . the lower the difference between two sig@@ natur@@ es , the more they meet . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each picture . by means of a sw@@ amp , the result can be increased or dimin@@ ished . if you move a picture of somewhere over the symbol of the insufficient search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open up and you can drop it there . &quot;
sk@@ etch : open @-@ hand color sk@@ etch : draw a fast sk@@ etch and read ; find the matching images too .
this rider provides an intuitive card vehicle based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can pull off with the mouse wheel or drag and move it . move it while you are fil@@ tered and displayed on the left mouse button . all images inside this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . this will naturally pres@@ upp@@ oses your paintings ge@@ o data .
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter at the bottom . it is then added for later use of the list below . he works like a live geography . &quot;
&quot; first came with a lumin@@ ous in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . he works with all supported image formats , including raw files . &quot;
&quot; choose one or more pictures from any view in the main window , and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em illumin@@ tically add from the context menu . the choice will be added to the lighthouse and open its window . the main window is , you can easily open the bul@@ let with L Extr@@ as . &quot;
&quot; from the pres@@ sible bar you can drag the pictures you want to see in the left or right area of the window . if you preview Pre@@ viewing from the tool@@ bar and perform zoo or deport@@ ation to one of the images , then they can compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to order quickly from a picture series . if you want to navigate the left mouse button on an arbitr@@ ary image , then display the left mouse button on the right side . the right adjacent picture is displayed in the right area . this is simplified it is simplified by a number of similar pictures . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal dis@@ ks are also working directly from the fi@@ del@@ ity , such as F@@ 4 file mach@@ ining .... &quot;
all the image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both pr@@ umb@@ nails in the lighthouse . this makes it possible to link visu@@ ell differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each sector , you will find a built @-@ in swing function , which instru@@ ct you to the crossed paths . in order to hold the visible area of the image , you have to stop this anchor and the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressed in the mode Pre@@ view both images will show the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . just use the z@@ oom @-@ regul@@ ator under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; Mou@@ wheel around into The picture into and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures when you preview in the mode Pre@@ view .
&quot; what is a digital component management - apart from the fashion ? digital construc@@ tors , each part of the process follows after the picture has been taken up to the final edition and the permanent storage . each of the photos is set up , sc@@ ans or digital photos carries out a form of digital component management . however , most of us do this , but not in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , protect and use photos . we consider downloading , re@@ determination , evaluate , evaluate , ver@@ ting , ver@@ ted , maintain , maintain , maintain and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; digital survey , focuses on , index@@ es , categor@@ ized , sec@@ ts , sec@@ tional , trans@@ forms , compliant and exported content to a mon@@ et@@ ular or cultural value . &quot;
met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data about data . met@@ ad@@ ata are available according to your definition of data that provide information about or a documentation of other data that will be managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you find more than 1000 photos on your machine , then you do not even know how many photos you have , then you do not even need to store the met@@ ad@@ ata for both in a database as well as in image files , and you can easily access the data with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you will do and know before you need to maintain something inside your system , the structure of information structure is to be organized somehow on your computer . you will have to decide whether other access to your photos do you want to store them on a reser@@ vo@@ c drive or etc . keep in mind that you have to switch to a bigger drive . &quot;
&quot; maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly on your location . unless you &apos;re using enough photos , then you will be sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export a folder for pictures you may print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , continuous access from pictures to different topics and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not be able to organise your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the p@@ ile process easier . separate new files .
the separation of original and work files facilit@@ ates a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are searching for an original or a deriv@@ ative picture .
&quot; we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata option to store Metad@@ ata in the display page of the met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ tization . this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file , then you can subsequently save the met@@ ad@@ ata from the data base in the files , by selecting the appropriate item in the menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what kind of a met@@ ad@@ ata Editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , since you should now select every photo key@@ word , co@@ atings and evaluation . of course you can select all the pictures that may need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; let us now leave with key@@ word , key@@ word as you frequently continue with other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
if you import the catalogue from a different source with embedded keywords then it &apos;s going to put the tree for you b@@ z@@ w will insert the pictures to the right place . the re@@ sort of Hier@@ archy inside the tree is not a problem and can easily be performed by the pull of a sub@@ tree on another . the changing keywords will be followed by &amp; digi@@ tization ; updates during the under@@ trees .
&quot; the graphics shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata is over@@ l@@ apped . this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ ad@@ ata is made in truth out of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and cal@@ ender dates for all pictures . &quot;
&quot; enough the keywords , the next section refers to claims or comments , the third important tool to catalog your met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; you do not want to let your photos only see your photos , they want to share them with your friends , family , other photographer and agencies . they are certainly interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then catch some details to see people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you this of the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Norman@@ die 60 years after landing is . Wow ! you start to dream , associations , memories , the historical time period is present again , you may even have the silence . the cap@@ tion has changed your perception of this panor@@ amas . &quot;
&quot; for others who see your photos may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer to Him to help Him over the mot@@ if that you move has the understanding of what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is fine when a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength only to act with a label for themselves alone . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ tization ; you can export as much text , in an internation@@ alised alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as lab@@ eling your pictures in web galleries . you can even export it to your wishes into the lab@@ eling and / or the title of web @-@ g@@ eri@@ or . you will have to tell the story for the opening times a second time . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find yourself to another city without navigation system ? it was not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Earth ? good , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now starts with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the ways to util@@ ise the Ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization can already be un@@ countable and will be able to continue in the future , in the near future , you can also repeat the photos on the reception . you can also export the photos on the reception center . you can also export the pictures to the gallery , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with the goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Maps viewer . &quot;
&quot; Copy@@ left is a post@@ ure with copyright and describes the practice to specify the copy@@ rights to remove limitations on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms are also in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you the information contained in the interior page of &amp; Find ; as information is stored :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for producer and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired , the name of a company or organisation can be used , it should not be changed anymore . this field does not support Kom@@ mas nor a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on . &quot;
author ( syn@@ onym for the author ) : associated with the author . examples of this can be titles as : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or Independent @-@ commercial photographer . since this is a comment on the author &apos;s author , this must be also un@@ filled . &quot;
editor ( syn@@ onym for vendors ) : use the provider to identify who the photo offers . this does not necessarily be the author . if the photographer does not apply for a message agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press then this organizations can be listed here . if the image is a camp then the picture / agency offers the picture here .
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , even though this does not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little bit more than basic knowledge about working with calcul@@ ator . however , the solution to this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this protection is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and Hal@@ b professionals , this protection is very important . &quot;
&quot; the digital water@@ mark is unique per image unique . &amp; digi@@ tization , in the near future , such a module for st@@ acking is available . &quot;
&quot; topics : PL@@ AT@@ TEN@@ FE@@ H@@ LER , turn@@ out , black@@ out , ECC , transmission errors , ag@@ eing of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , age @-@ time , temperature size , common super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the road or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can also happen in traditional papers or negative . in this section , we are dealing with problems with the so @-@ called new media . &quot;
&quot; roll On@@ track , the biggest data display company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a data loss . &quot;
&quot; to combat the issue with CDs / DVDs , these pre @-@ quality CDs must be treated and you cannot last longer than a couple of years . of course you can also keep CDs and DVDs in archives . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe that is in your disposition . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD disc@@ s can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can use this risk in which you use good dis@@ ks and good recording sessions . the best DVD recording are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much reliable . so it is about select the correct one . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to error , even if you just have only been written . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for the form@@ atting and control . despite this massive protection they are required by chemical aging , ultr@@ avi@@ ol@@ ettes light , cro@@ quet , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for defects of CDs and DVDs , there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently causes miracles to CDs and DVDs . however , it &apos;s not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar uses which damaged data from damaged disk@@ ettes , hard disk drives , Flash@@ media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to gain the For@@ mat@@ ing against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus nearly six@@ teen the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all of which was said to CDs and DVDs , of course also applies to Blu @-@ ray . &quot;
&quot; burn off slowly with a good recording on high quality media in a not propri@@ ated format . then read then the media with a description , date &amp; author marks and afterwards to a clean , dark dry and spot protected place . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can be read through this media . &quot;
disc@@ s retain your statistics for yourself . their manufacturer &apos;s g@@ ments include a new disk but not the data . Google will provide a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disk : dis@@ errors
&quot; in short : disc@@ s keep on the longest if you are operated in the temper@@ ate area of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temper@@ boards , S@@ MAR@@ T cannot notice these errors . some of S@@ MAR@@ T can not notice the immediate follow @-@ up . these are in particular reading shift and rel@@ uc@@ tance for the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete losses due to tension . of course , you can also have data loss due to an electricity unless you secured the files , but these losses normally can be re @-@ produced without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical equipment power violations occur not much , the resulting in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed sensors . these can cause serious harm . on your computer , these an@@ om@@ alies may cause serious harm , break@@ age mother@@ boards and other defects . therefore , protect themselves before the in@@ avo@@ id@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
the most widespread protection against black@@ outs is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and ground@@ ed the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ bar . remember that not every plug @-@ bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to the protection against flash collapse and thus protecting the correctly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ voltage of each cable can use to your computer , you should be careful that also all periph@@ er@@ als are connected to your system . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage access for your mo@@ dem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ ax@@ ial cable of cable @-@ mode@@ ms and television card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks - and they also contain the protection for the mo@@ dem . thus , you are ideal for travel . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection your system protects against smaller sw@@ ings in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete hair loss . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a break@@ able power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protection from over@@ voltage devices , these devices can automatically provide cordless energy when a black@@ out occurs . this gives you the possibility to keep your data and run the system again . if you &apos;re buying a US@@ V , you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the life @-@ time of the battery and the attached software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; concern the potential risk to your computer system and compare its security in electric dis@@ rup@@ tions with the cost to avoid this . a high quality super@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you think about how good your computer is utilized . at the end , you should always think all of your cables before you go on holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service . with proper configuration you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amounts of data . &quot;
&quot; you are in comparison to the hard@@ disk at home , but very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost of dollars ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data on the compar@@ atively long @-@ term Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are available online . its free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have any more pictures available in the event of Flick@@ r dramatically more . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited memory , which should be verified only in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of the data protection , the Web @-@ solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically certified thanks to the TCP @-@ protocol and with the large companies is included in the offer a backup and a distribution memory . thus they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ safe . &quot;
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transfers are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ es provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred . all these distur@@ b@@ ances remain un@@ discovered until you have destroyed a photo and this to your surprise lies . no one seems to have thought of it . no one seems to have thought of it . the internet with its TCP protocol is a much more secure way than that of your computer .
&quot; un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transmission losses as they create interference within the data flow . with normal fil@@ es@@ ystems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are currently not affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
Z@@ FS of Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates with record errors and are highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one of the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it &apos;s soon also for &amp; Linux ; and Windows only available . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . it is still used in alpha @-@ status . it is still using the same protective mechanisms which is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is still not part of the kernel .
&quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data losses in the not@@ ebook and 46 % in charge systems . with Not@@ ebooks , the proportion of the theft amounts to 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most think . it results in a lower damage , as e.g. theft or new install@@ ationen . and it is currently limited to Microsoft Systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under Linux ; has long been seen no more sight@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , travelling F@@ s , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the spread file systems . a very good English article can be found here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , just the speed of the procedure during an operation is higher and an in@@ defin@@ able status is avoided . if a file is not completely saved before the problem appeared , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : incorrect , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for these progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics are no longer far away from this border .
&quot; today &apos;s cameras go up in the direction of 10 Meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and high quality optics are the optimum size for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have increased your limit at 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolution , you need a full format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard drive will get you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so you do not make anyone other for data losses . so secure your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make any other haz@@ ard like the re@@ install of your operating system , the exchange of plates or size change of dis@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make daily your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a light@@ ening suggests you are lucky when the drive was not connected to the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster proposes locally and destroyed a lot . forget aer@@ on@@ au@@ ght : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ ization does not always mean any local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs into the neighboring house , into your office or a similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup , which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files will be guaranteed . it is a snap@@ shot of the history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential assurance : a backup of the files have been changed since the last turn @-@ over . creates a complete snap@@ shot of the two tim@@ eline : that of the complete backup and the last difference .
&quot; incre@@ mental securing : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup , generates several times . you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup is made . this backup comes with a version@@ ing system next with the exception that is only off @-@ running and not continuous . &quot;
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that allows you to easily configure on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts . this occurs com@@ pressed and if you want to increase safety via ss@@ h .
ensure important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer to DVD or other optical medium .
&quot; this approach makes you enough time to un@@ cover losses and restore it . at the same time you come for a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot of each month . each further pull @-@ out should be done manually , after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; themes : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in the file @-@ file IP@@ TC information , Associ@@ ated X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , reproduce of images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; thus you can survive the next 40 year that is about the time span in which you really are interested in your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be observed : &quot;
&quot; because the future is un@@ predic@@ table because of your nature , you have to see everything that is said today with caution . unfortunately , there is no other possibility to be viewed as a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this issue should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every@@ time when you change your machine architecture , your memory and f@@ use technology , or change your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the professional expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . it actually means greater .
&quot; let us assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability with planned and put the area that you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition . at * nix Systems such as Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record : &quot;
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang it . &quot;
&amp; D = / dev / s@@ dc &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ dc # Source is / dev / s@@ dc / s@@ dc / s@@ dc / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ FR / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of the di@@ iser@@ fs if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software anymore that you can read it . this task will be even easier from year to year .
&quot; GI@@ F is a propriet@@ ory , patented format disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG was supposed to replace an open source standard of the GI@@ F . it can be a lot more . it is lost , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ am@@ f and IP@@ TC Metad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can only collect as many administrative information , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F . this format we would like to recommend you to save your pictures . &quot;
T@@ IF@@ F has been widely used as image format . T@@ IF@@ F can be stored in un@@ com@@ pressed form or in a container with a lost @-@ free float algorithms ( De@@ fl@@ ate ) . a problem is however that this format has been adjusted by many people . therefore there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The Digital neg@@ atives file format is a licence @-@ free and open @-@ format format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G was developed on the basis of the need of met@@ ad@@ ata . a handful of camera points has now been available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon it will eventually use .
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ forms quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a characteristic configuration that allows users to add their data into a file . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer a original of your shot , mostly in raw format , to archive . X@@ MP doesn &apos;t fit one of the file file , but there can be some problems with the link between the met@@ ad@@ ata file and the image file and how the file should be noted . therefore , you should consider whether you use DN@@ G as a container and put everything there together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata standards , which includes a large range of application areas and business models . among the activities of D@@ CM@@ I community and the D@@ CM@@ I community groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard , and enlight@@ ening efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the dealer or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera table , you can use it as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save them in your original archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fin@@ ite processing , you can use external programs . if you get the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ tised , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut under certain programs from the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the mach@@ ined images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in Web@@ gal@@ eri@@ or , code them in MPEG , use &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ tization . in the section by adding a photo to an album you will find a description , as you can add photos you already have on your hard drive , but the camera interface provides you with a lot of advanced settings to import images to your album database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tization ; to use , connect them to the display mode , turn the camera on the display mode and place them . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if you start the camera interface , it &apos;s trying to connect with your camera . if the connection is manufactured , a Ready @-@ indicator can be displayed on the lower end and the sub@@ vert pictures of all photos on the camera appears . some cameras don &apos;t display any view@@ ings . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for the file order are displayed for any file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you might need the camera information to any associated entry . with the page features and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an item or its met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog displays file properties and the photo information that is saved internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . please note that some digital cameras will not be available to your computer . &quot;
&quot; the tab met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as replacement , producer , GPS etc . , the same as in the met@@ ad@@ ata page from the main window of &amp; digi@@ tization . please note that these met@@ ad@@ ata are not available in some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the selection of All . this invites all photos from their camera to a single album that has been downloaded before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired by default output method of &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the button to download the button . the button un@@ named after you have selected , until you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera does not support this , an option is new to download . these images have not been downloaded up until now . in this case the new pictures are downloaded with a star in the default window . if you choose this option , of course , only the new pictures are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; when you use the buttons all or chosen , appears a dialog with which you can select the target album . the list of existing albums are sorted , as default folder , then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after having selected the target album , you press OK , and get started ; loads the photos from the camera into the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once , delet@@ ing the button delete All . if you only want to delete a few , then you must delete them first and then delete . &quot;
&quot; note that there is no way to delete pictures you deleted from the camera . so , the photos are not downloaded in the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer of &amp; k@@ de ; immediately , they are completely deleted . if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photographs frequently not especially meaningful name . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually deleted again when you load photos of different recording galleries into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the picture was taken into the fil@@ en@@ ames . &quot;
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mir@@ rors of the image and for file @-@ based under@@ mines . if you use this last option automatically one folder is created per day .
&quot; the options during transmission opens three other options that are implemented before the photos are stored on the plate . the first two concern the data about the author in the IP@@ TC fields . with the latest option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures . &quot;
if you want to add another file format than the default format you can use for example in the coating field the pre@@ fix photo@@ - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . place the help of the command str@@ f@@ time read .
&quot; when you use the option camera files , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in case letters . or in grand@@ letter , if you prefer . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ tised , used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera is available in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming is saved and used automatically when you open the camera next time . &quot;
&quot; when you get involved , all the information on the orientation of the camera is available to perform an automatic rotation during the download . not all cameras will display this information . in the side@@ bar Metad@@ ata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is usually enabled , and if your camera does not provide this information , the photo is in the original orientation . if you want to switch the automatic rotation , use the kno@@ b and select the Autom@@ atic la@@ ung in the lower area of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera records information about the date , when the photo was made available , you can download it automatically . all pictures with the same date are loaded onto the same sub@@ album . not all cameras are available in the same sub@@ album . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ a @-@ data you can read , which information your camera might have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually off , and in this case stores &amp; digi@@ tization ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change it , you need to switch this option off and select the option X@@ ums@@ y sub@@ mit@@ es at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; the simpl@@ est way photos from your computer to load their camera , is the button @-@ button download . select then upload files . the file op@@ tionally select dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files , you can also select more than one file using the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods . &quot;
&quot; after the selection is done , you ask where the pictures are to be loaded up . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . click here the desired folder and press OK to load the up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position is meant to be indicated in long@@ itu@@ dinal and l@@ ati@@ tudes and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers can link it interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an aircraft to extract an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability . &quot;
&quot; if you later have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken , you can submit a browser which indicates the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; touch ; users want to locate the place of the photo , it &apos;s good to show the position data of one photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data are supported in the image ? first , you should know that exi@@ ties are supported in these fields ? there are at least three ways to reach this . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , through a post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files to the geographical assignment ( manual ) and most recently via the manual input of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera , which has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receiver . either as a map or through the transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;

downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you need to save this data in g@@ p@@ x format since this is the only format that is supported by the module to geographic assignment .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that extract data from images and GPS . on the following page you can get the same under &amp; Linux ; ps@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itu@@ dinal and l@@ ati@@ tudes or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ tool of Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the coordinates coordinates , e.g. from map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ googl@@ e.com shows no European street cards . here are some European sites , at least in french , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; when you come ; try to give you as much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are lots of settings to access the behavior of &amp; digi@@ tization . to select on these settings , you have to enter the menu settings . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left . &quot;
&quot; select action can display on built @-@ in preview or image editing . so , they set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ff ; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardization and copyright data . these data are automatically selected in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface . even when database synchron@@ ization is synchron@@ ized this data into IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; title is a syn@@ onym for fibre line : this field should be the professional drawing of the photographer . these can be design@@ ations such as employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a further description of the car field , this must also be filled . &quot;
editor is a syn@@ onym for vendors : use this field to specify the picture . this must not be the author if this is included for a message agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press then these organizations should be registered here since then the group or agency should be en@@ umer@@ ated here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . it is achieved that the met@@ ad@@ ata is permanently contained in the picture and not only came in the database of the digi@@ tization ; these met@@ ad@@ ata are also available in other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ tization without getting lost .
&quot; images described as a built @-@ in co@@ atings ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JP@@ EG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you incorporate to your photos , with the images contained in pictures , these can also include cap@@ tions , these are already written by the read of the read ; over@@ written . &quot;
&quot; the page settings contains all options for the information that appear , when the mouse c@@ ursor in the main window via a file rests . depending on the chosen option this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ tised , supports a number of different formats and some video and audio formats . to determine which file types &amp; digi@@ tization has been written , you can add the file extension this list and remove it . each file in a &amp; digi@@ ous ; Alb@@ um@@ ord@@ ner came , which has no such extensions , that came from &amp; digi@@ tised . &quot;
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button re@@ fresh from each category .
&quot; the settings of the lumin@@ ance of &amp; digi@@ tization has been set on this page for default values . however , if you then open the lumin@@ aire . some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size inv@@ en@@ quot ; if you have one , then you can obtain a better overview results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different colour , you can switch it here . you can switch the tool@@ bar when you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; charging and under@@ exposed parts of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or lighter color in the picture . these colours can be specified here . in the Picture Edit@@ ing Side , this view page can be switched mode with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and switched off . &quot;
&quot; with Chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in color reports . please read this article in Wikipedia , for the closer statement . &quot;
&quot; with the setting of P@@ NG com@@ pression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation is not the image quality , since P@@ NG used a wast@@ ed algorith@@ m . the only effect is that the image data is more time to un@@ loading and un@@ zip . if you have a quick machine , you can set this value to a high com@@ pression . that means 1 : a low and 9 a high com@@ pression . &quot;
&quot; to com@@ press the T@@ IF@@ F files , you can switch to the De@@ fl@@ ate product algorithms for T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . it has no effect on the image quality , since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorith@@ m is released . &quot;
&quot; when selecting the loss of JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files you can get lost @-@ free . even if you have written the loss of loss , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JP@@ EG . as this paragraph has not yet been supported , but still in the planning . &quot;
in the previous versions of &amp; digi@@ tization ; the picture editing only one image used for photos . at present it develops very quickly to a tool for mani@@ pulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing .
&quot; the standard gain is that all green pixels are equal . if the straight @-@ out green pixels of the C@@ CD sensor , this difference makes an ar@@ mo@@ uring pattern in the issue . if you use this option , you solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option identi@@ fies the image a little soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 G@@ mo@@ p patterns with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; when this option is set , the white dress is used as the camera . otherwise , when set , the Autom@@ atic color @-@ balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting will only be used when the white balance is not set . standard is it a fixed color @-@ balance , which was photographed on a white card which was photographed in sunlight . &quot;
this setting will only support Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SLR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ going images get more details in four steps more details in the back@@ locks . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
&quot; the standard is the back@@ light , i.e. the parts of your pictures show the top @-@ in , because of the in@@ capacity of your camera indicates some unusual results , as it shows the back@@ light in various ros@@ at@@ ches . most recently , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the back@@ light . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ tised , and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red parts from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or wh@@ ites you want . &quot;
&quot; when you select the option re@@ constructed , you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be customized for each picture separately . &quot;
&quot; Set the L@@ umin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to put it somewhat higher than the default 1 . however , this can also hold it later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ tization . to hold the time for the demo@@ version , you should be conservative . &quot;
&quot; a dem@@ os@@ a@@ o@@ icing algorith@@ m is a digital recording process , which comes with a complete picture from the sub @-@ related images that have many cameras and which is a matrix of color @-@ colored pixels . this algorith@@ m is also known as CF@@ A @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ construction . &quot;
&amp; nbsp ; and D@@ cra@@ w put you three alternatives available : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorith@@ m used by D@@ cra@@ w . it creates color @-@ heart@@ ed to the edges . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the colour vari@@ ance of your lenses , you can put the red and blue @-@ correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for color correction , as it is carried out during det@@ ention . &quot;
a profile translated the color @-@ information and gives instructions like this to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ tised ; information as the color @-@ formations of a colour to translate into the others are thus the colors as closely as possible .
behavior questions when a picture is opened in image editing / colour control module with raw files .
&quot; click here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you all store your profile . &quot;
&quot; configuration of the ICC profiles you have here the possibility of &quot; &quot; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be stored . everything can be changed when opening the raw file . &quot;
the colour control view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ro . here you are only your pictures and manages the entire screen .
input profiles should be used to the camera support and model you use . not all profiles are included in the same type . there are some such as Canon which does not contain colour mapping or gam@@ mak@@ or@@ re@@ gery . currently corrected d@@ cra@@ w gam@@ ma not for con@@ versions at 16 bit depth . this means you must carry out the color mapping yourself .
&quot; there are other options like the soft @-@ proof profile , which you can em@@ ulate how your image can be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print it , since your printer commands a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated , rather than rely on the blind algorith@@ m of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is pretty obvious that colour profile is provided with them for what . unfortunately , not for the models of Canon . therefore , here a table of cameras and profiles follows together . this answer is naturally in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon Drives sets the style for the destination : F for an accurate style , L for neutral , N for Neutr@@ al , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; pictures looked and image work@@ stations . many modules support that were written to work with any program that supported the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I module , you will see a list of available modules . choose the items you want to use , and these are then released by &amp; digi@@ tization ; this modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and furthermore you will find some also in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules , can set in the menu under settings short commands . &quot;
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found via the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the sli@@ deshow should be easy to understand . the upper regul@@ ator takes the time between the picture above , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other crosses are able to switch the met@@ ad@@ ata and which ends at the bottom of the pictures during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera properties show on the left hand a list of all supported cameras . on the right above there is a button auto detection , which is trying to connect the camera connected , switched on the computer . currently , here are the port settings . currently , here &apos;s serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage devices . this field is only active if you choose a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera . you must indicate here the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / re@@ generator , specify on which you attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tization , you need to connect the camera to your computer to integrate it into the display mode . &quot;
&quot; check out whether &amp; nbsp ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es . if not , you can set a camera dell and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera appears in the menu camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera manually . in case you have more than one camera , you can insert it here . &quot;
&quot; with the option of confirmation for the moving of &gt; Images in the M@@ ül@@ men , you can view the testim@@ onies of &amp; digi@@ tization ; in the clear@@ ing of a photo in an album . in the sections of a photographs and clear@@ ing a album you will find further details . &quot;
editorial changes through the right side bar can be applied silent through &amp; digi@@ tization ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar with no queries . otherwise , you will need to apply changes to the button changes . &quot;
&quot; you can also tie the display of the Welcome tank from &amp; digi@@ tization , when starting hand , this speeds up the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; the setting of Bei@@ m came to look for new pictures &amp; digi@@ tised , the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos ; this extends the starting time of the base folder when something came from the base folder , asks , asking if it is to delete them from the database . &quot;
different shades can be used in &amp; digi@@ tization ; used to adjust the main window to your tastes . these settings allows you to select from settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be en@@ umer@@ ated below :
&quot; these designs are defined in simple text@@ files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ tization , you will find more information about this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; &amp; nbsp ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and to view correction and improvement . image editing can be started by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture , or by the context menu of the viewing and selection of the entries / editing . &quot;
image editing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of these are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ tization . so under certain circumstances they are not part of your distribution . more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the Image editing .
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current data @-@ number , enlar@@ ging factor and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top edge and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most common functions .
&quot; the processing functions of the editing process change your photos . however , no of the features will change the original photo before you save file saved or the button save file from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo as soon as you saved the image . &quot;
so you should make a copy of your image before you change it . this can save you with file saved .
&quot; as long as you do not have saved the photo , you can recover the original image by recover from the menu File Rec@@ recover or the kno@@ b of the button editing re@@ manufacture in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have carried out in the photo since the last store . &quot;
virtually any action of picture editing can be und@@ one or recovered . the last action you can be revers@@ ed by selecting re@@ direc@@ ting or re@@ inst@@ ated by selecting editing from the menu .
&quot; when you use this frequently , you should make yourself the keyboard abbrevi@@ ations , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to the back , and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ um@@ ph@@ alt @-@ Z for re @-@ establish . &quot;
&quot; if you select the &amp; L@@ MB , on the trac@@ e@@ ering or re @-@ recover kno@@ b in the tool@@ bar a moment longer , you will get a context menu . if you choose one of the menu items , all actions in between also und@@ res@@ sed and restored . &quot;
&quot; once you started the picture editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture above or the entries in the menu item , you will be wondering if you want to save it . &quot;
you can finish in the photo and rip zo@@ oming in the you C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the refer@@ encing .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magnific@@ ation factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view Full mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come into the normal view in which you use the vin@@ c button . usually , you can change this in the introduc@@ tory dialog of &amp; digi@@ tization ; then you can view this in the introduc@@ tory dialog of &amp; digi@@ tization ; you can view this in the introduc@@ tory dialog . you can view the section on placing the picture editing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current picture , you can select the picture file and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can select individual images or entire phrases . you only need to select the pictures with the default methods and select from the menu album to export printer assist@@ ent . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the board@@ walk came ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page is available , without the navigation file , even in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
&quot; multiple clicks on the same rider , the side@@ bar lets appear and disappear again in the margin . &quot;
&quot; in the cap@@ tion view , you can enter co@@ atings with limited size or insert it . note the text below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed to be used in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
the IP@@ TC data support only ASC@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut down after 2000 signs and special characters are shaped . if you want to use the IP@@ TC cap@@ tion in other applications , you should consider these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after having commented on it , you can use either the button or simply change the next picture , the co@@ atings are then stored . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the applying button , there is a button More . with this you can read further met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or the database . however , this will always be done if you have chosen a met@@ ad@@ ata that will always be written in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the review rating indicates a review of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in Su@@ ples and sor@@ ting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar , or with the keyboard short@@ cut . to evaluate several images at the same time , choose these from and use the context menu . &quot;
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the coding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
&quot; the sampling review shows a search box to the filter of the keywords , the keywords and a selection box with the previously contained in this &amp; digi@@ tization ; -@@ session informed key@@ word . &quot;
the keywords will be dynam@@ ically adapted to the key@@ word . you can restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a key@@ word quickly . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the lower end is a further relief when entering the keywords in a picture series . if you have entered various keywords , these are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by mark@@ ings of the corresponding sub@@ cross fields in the tree . all the tags of each image are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
&quot; when multiple images are selected in the main window and select a key@@ word in the key@@ note image , this is only applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to choose a sample with a key@@ word , please read the posts section . &quot;
&quot; the page s@@ pro@@ w@@ filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - , key@@ word and search views . if additionally one or more sampling filter is used from the right , only the sni@@ pp@@ ets of these two are displayed . all presented keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and paste . suppose you have selected multiple images in the main window , you can drag it out of the right side bar and put on the selection . consequently , a dialog box you ask if you want to put the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window indicates the pictures on a calendar day . the Stich@@ ting filter is reduced to No keywords which were dropped out on three pictures . they were asked with Str@@ g + a , and afterwards a key@@ word from the right keywords will be asked and there was a dialogue whether this keywords should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place during each start of the program . it can also be distributed under settings in the Miscellaneous .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and realize that it should be one or more , you can easily change it with a double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry when searching in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
&quot; 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , set in the database . &quot;
you can choose such an Advanced search over all the elements of the database with the following options :
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the cross area at the end of the rule and then use the button . the options look as follows : &quot;
why have Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flick@@ r not listed ? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to store the pictures in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I found it mainly to El@@ le for this work . I have adapted it to concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why you use a multic@@ ol@@ ored work@@ flow , that is the colors available from your camera or scanner . with a colored Work@@ flow , you can achieve that colors will print on your monitor those of your camera respectively scanner , and that the colors will print you or on the web publishing out of your digital dark room . &quot;
&quot; when the theme is on color management , everyone wants to know what buttons it must press for the results he wants . unfortunately , the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you with adequate background information on color management . additionally , you will find links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to make you want the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your work@@ flow meets all the above criteria , then you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated at the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum . ( more information can be found below )
&quot; your only other formats are via e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ R@@ GB of de facto standard is standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ R@@ GB works so well and makes life for all so simple , why should you use another color tree and have to think about pig@@ lets ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ fi@@ ant region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger colors to visit Bruce Lin@@ d@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and then click on Info and then to Information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to pay my monitor for my monitor when I decided to work only in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in the s@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , or not , you need to work your monitor k@@ alli@@ ze , since s@@ R@@ GB work , therefore , you need to work as in the Far@@ br@@ aum of s@@ R@@ GB , then you must either use your monitor to the s@@ R@@ GB standard , a suitable monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you try another . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize the functions norm@@ alize , un@@ equal , automatic shut@@ down and contrast , try to make the best of your colors . they will be experimenting with these effects to see which is best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sk@@ ali@@ ert the lumin@@ ous control over the entire image so that the dark point black and the bright@@ est point is as bright as possible without changing its colour@@ ing . this function is often a magnetic correction for images that are dark or washed .
&quot; the method suggests the illumin@@ ant of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ og@@ ram of the intensity can be as flat as possible . it also produces a very powerful operation which causes either wonders in a picture or destroyed it . &quot;
&quot; automatic shut@@ down : this method maxim@@ izes the color area in the red , green and blue canal . they determine the dark and light border @-@ tones and dark the red , green and blue channels to complete history . &quot;
contrast : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of one image by moving the lowest and highest values of all values in between . this is only visible in mature images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white @-@ passage of &amp; digi@@ came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry the white off of a photo .
&quot; the white @-@ equal correction is slightly restricted to a color @-@ room with 8 @-@ bit per colour . if you can do so far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . in case you are able to perform the white balance in the 16 @-@ bit mode , then your possibilities will be better off . &quot;
&quot; this tool is based on a white @-@ equation algorithms , protected by P@@ aw@@ el T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym protected . you start it over the menu @-@ application colours white pic@@ tured of imaging . &quot;
&quot; the showcase can be adapted to the size . on the left , both the original image and the preview of the target will be adapted . the preview is dynam@@ ically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original wel@@ d again , it is enough to click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the pix@@ fix under this mark@@ er is shown as vertical line in the hist@@ og@@ ram .
&quot; on the right is a hist@@ og@@ ram displayed that dynamic is changed once you have a parameter . this hist@@ og@@ ram is very helpful as , even in well illuminated images , most pixels are very small L@@ umin@@ ous values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colours or your sum is indicated . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and Gamma as . the shadow of alignment can also improve the shadows with your photos or also downloaded .
An@@ stat with the above checks around you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . push this button and then somewhere on the picture show for the calculation of colour temperature of the white balance . this way also the temperature and green values are automatically set .
additionally you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available :
the over@@ k@@ able indi@@ an increase the colors when more than a color channel of the pix@@ els over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in the white balance sheet . this is shown in the preview as a cleaner indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; the buttons save as and shop make exactly this . any adjustment of the white balance , which you have set aside , you can save up into a text file and later load . &quot;
the button pres@@ ets puts all filter@@ ing back on its default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . please note that neutral settings may arise another photo as your original . if you save this will change your original image .
&quot; you can set up here the co@@ di@@ ets per color channel of the lab@@ eled image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely spread JP@@ EG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality pictures . this coding needs also more record space , calcul@@ ating time and stands up for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and DN@@ G . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialogue as to the processing of raw materials . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour mapping can be carried out by the sub@@ window for the use of color profiles . a det@@ a@@ illed manual for the use of color profiles can be applied .
another important tool is to be found in the menu under colors Ton@@ s@@ correction correction . this tool provides an integrated way to use multiple colors . this is helpful when your camera or your scanner always make the same mistake and therefore you can always find the same correction . in the manual for the sound@@ proo@@ fing you will find more information .
a very powerful possibility of correc@@ ting problems is the tool for gr@@ ad@@ ation that you can find under colors Gr@@ ad@@ ation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; Pres@@ ent came ; tool Far@@ by effects puts you four color effects , a solar @-@ effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a cant@@ ar@@ filter at your disposal . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing was solar isation , also Sab@@ ati@@ er mentioned , a effect that was created when one replaced a partially developed pressures of a short light@@ ning . this had the effect that the bright@@ ens areas shel@@ tered by the second lights . this tool was a part negative of the picture . this tool allows you to fin@@ ite this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar isation . at around 50 % intensity , the image is not possible to generate chem@@ ically possible . an increase will eventually create a negative image so that not on Fot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . &quot;
this is an example of solar energy efficiency . the original image is the ( 1 ) and it works ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vid filter si@@ eves the so called &quot; &quot; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ Eff@@ ect . it differs from a satur@@ ation that makes it a stronger contr@@ asting effect , that makes the colors brilliant and glow . try it simple , it em@@ bell@@ ished many photos . &quot;
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for one on day@@ light optim@@ ised cock@@ at@@ ure@@ film made by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth structure . Vel@@ via features very saturated color , but also some photographers , especially those hardly rec@@ alled landscapes . &quot;
&quot; the ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contr@@ asts of the result . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result , and the sli@@ der repeat the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . with large images the filter can charge the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to correct the color contr@@ asts and the lumin@@ osity of your photos with the tools in the menu . all of your gran@@ ting you can view in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you use the button O@@ k and you are applied .
if you get a photo of bad light conditions you can get the reverse problem : one too big satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation will reduce it . all changes you can perform in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with o@@ k .
&quot; between the complex tool gr@@ ad@@ ation and the simple lumin@@ aire / gam@@ ma / gam@@ ma is the tool sound @-@ correction to improve the exposure . even if the dialogue on this tool is very complicated , it requires the area of the sli@@ der . concrete , the three sli@@ der below the hist@@ ograms . &quot;
&quot; the window includes a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ og@@ ram , of the active channel or the selected area . under the graphs are three sli@@ der into the inside and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the controller and take care of how the image changes .
&quot; on the right side you can see the original and preview of the picture . preview is dynamic , updated with the settings of the image . on the left , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set if the hist@@ og@@ ram symbol@@ ises with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic y axis . for pictures of a digital camera , linear hist@@ og@@ ram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic use is useful . &quot;
&quot; three Reg@@ ul@@ ators : the top for the dark sounds , the medium for the bright sound @-@ tones and the lowest for medium tones , frequently called gam@@ ma values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ ks can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically end the input values of the shadow , middle and light tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for an fully automatic gran@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow for the selection of manual values for each field . there are also two regul@@ ators used to change the output values , e.g. to create a multi@@ purpose image as a background and to see something else in the foreground . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically placed in dependence on the intensity of the image . &quot;
save as and store : with these buttons you can store the typ@@ ed values in the fil@@ es@@ ystem and later loaded . this Gimp Levels format is used .
&quot; if you use this mode and the three colour sti@@ p@@ ettes , the input values will be automatically re@@ activated for all the shade , means and Sundays . enable the color p@@ oo@@ ks you want to use and click on the preview of the original images for Rot@@ - , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ als channels . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ se@@ k@@ able indicator controls all color channels to display un@@ covered pi@@ xel and show you the combined result of all channels . here is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview , and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image has ( 1 ) , and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left , half of the original and the target picture is shown , the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available : &quot;
modifications channel : this sel@@ ections allows to enter the channel which is altered by the module :
&quot; in addition to this cas@@ ket there are two symbols to change between a linear and log@@ ari@@ th@@ tic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera , the linear mode is most form@@ ative . for pictures with large areas of constant color creates linear mode a broad range . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ ic mode is further . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move to the right to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones with dark output points and that the associated image pi@@ xel will be dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; preview the original photos is a red mark@@ ings to see . if you want to change this mark@@ ings to the area you want to change , a perfect line is displayed on the curve which is the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down , until the value is manifest@@ ed according to your taste . &quot;
save as and store : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each bend that you created can be saved in the fil@@ es@@ ystem and later loaded . the file format is the Gimp &apos;s format .
&quot; if you want to create this method and the three colours buttons , automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , intermediate and Sundays . enable the color p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the check@@ points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ ous curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ se@@ k@@ able indicator controls all color channels to display un@@ covered pi@@ xel . if in more than one channel se@@ al@@ ete pixels , you get the combined result only in the preview , and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ white picture which has been corrected in the L@@ umin@@ aire channel . shadow and Sundays was applied with the color p@@ ette and applied to the cur@@ ves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the canal mix@@ er of the &amp; digi@@ tization ; picture editing is a tool to improve the paint channels or change the color grad@@ ations of the photos .
the channel Mix@@ er is another top @-@ designed tool to mix the shades of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mix@@ er of image editing .
&quot; using the channel @-@ box , you can correct the color for the hist@@ og@@ ram : this gives you a first reference how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window indicates a preview . the original can be viewed as compared to your own rider . &quot;
the preview of the target has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture a vertical line in the hist@@ og@@ ram to show you the appropriate color worth .
&quot; controls for the module are right below : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . in case you can also retain L@@ umin@@ ance . this is particularly convenient if you also enable the configuration items to produce great black @-@ white con@@ versions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix in Monoch@@ rome , the reduction of one color leads to a visible cor@@ ps which comes from the colour channel . colour th@@ ey@@ ed consists of small rob@@ bers which can not occur at the same place in the color canal . if that &apos;s the case you can improve your Monoch@@ rome . thus , in which you reduce the color will first . &quot;
the stor@@ ing as and load buttons are used precisely for this purpose . each mix@@ er adjustment can be stored for later and then load . the used file format is the Gimp channel mix@@ er format .
&quot; the option over@@ se@@ k@@ able indicator controls all color channels to display un@@ covered pi@@ xel and show you the combined result of all channels . here is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview , and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo where the blue canal has been re@@ activated . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is activated ( 1 ) and the original picture under ( 2 ) can be seen below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography is black / white a working step because colour pictures simply can be converted to the computer . also with a set of film rolls profiles .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot;
green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good at all scen@@ eries and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so much like the 00@@ 4 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Grün@@ filter .
Oran@@ ge@@ il@@ ter : simul@@ ated a black / white film exposure with an or@@ ged l@@ int@@ filter . this enh@@ ances landscapes , maritime scenes and air@@ pictures . so similar to the 002 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; red filter : simul@@ ated a black / white film exposure with a red liner filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects , and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar light for day@@ time . thus , like the 00@@ 3 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter . &quot;
Gel@@ b@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow stri@@ pper . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and with it similar to 001 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Gel@@ b@@ filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : creating warm bright and medium tones while he adds a bit of cold in the shadow and the re @-@ development in a Sep@@ ul@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similarly to the 005 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool texture can apply you can apply decorative textures to a picture .
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a colour image or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the Sti@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a m@@ ural on a wall . the menu item image can be used for this . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the sem@@ bl@@ ance of the depth or three @-@ dimensional texture in the picture .
a paper Tex@@ ture effect has been applied at the photo below . the original image has been shown ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief is set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to keep his attention is to create a decorative setting . this is a psych@@ ologic barrier for the stre@@ aming eye . below the picture you can add the module from image editing .
&quot; type : with this parameter you set the desired rate type for your image . by detail the picture with a coloured line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce um@@ ran@@ ates it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white photos ) , wash@@ basin it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a button @-@ friendly and decorative frame , adding a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : returns the width of the frame in percent . the value for width is limited to 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; this with the frame paint target will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing of images , especially if you have used the tool after page ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can simply insert a form@@ att@@ ed text in an image at any point . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . just enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text orientation , orientation , color from the color tree and the character set with its characteristics as you need . you will just choose a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ clear background . already , the picture is finished . &quot;
&quot; every setting you have chosen for your text can be changed , until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the picture was saved , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool sch@@ ema ) you can apply a template via a picture .
the menu model sten@@ cil in the picture editing can be used to put templates over a picture .
for the sten@@ cil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . you need to work with maximum com@@ pression ( 9 ) for the reduction of file size of sten@@ cil . if you want to add a template to the file size of sten@@ cil ; you just send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ list ; mailbox @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; when you use this tool for the first time , you have to put your template folder with the button base folder in dialogue . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be ma@@ stered for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root @-@ folder for the sten@@ cils has been set up a building review , which reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil . the selection of a folder is updated the sub@@ s@@ ors of the sten@@ cils . &quot;
below preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnific@@ ation factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this kno@@ b is magni@@ fied the dar@@ ing picture . it is centered on the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse kno@@ b .
&quot; crus@@ hing the underlying image below . it is centered on the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole image , you must load the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move this button to move the picture below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
&quot; OK , if you want to apply the sten@@ cil to your image . the image will then be fully adapted to the default size . &quot;
&amp; nbsp ; provides three different tools for grin@@ ding . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ed is a traditional tool for har@@ ps . it is very fast and simple , but produces , especially in the dark areas , gra@@ ined images . &quot;
Un@@ le@@ fe mask works on the contrast of the edges to look a picture shar@@ per . actually it &apos;s not a bit ; it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it &apos;s here a really good job . the algorith@@ m was taken from Gimp and it is copy@@ right@@ ed by Win@@ ston Chang .
&quot; refl@@ ective is probably the best of the three , because he really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in his application and has several parameters to adapt . &quot;
&quot; photos without focus as well as most of digi@@ tised pictures require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . these elements are smaller than the dissolution into paper . the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper . SLR cameras normally require more detri@@ mental to be normal cameras for the private use . &quot;
&quot; in JP@@ EG &apos;s images , it is often applied to a camera internal sof@@ ten@@ ing . pictures in raw format against it always have to be shar@@ pen@@ ed while processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner turn a black@@ ish filter during the reading of the picture . if you dis@@ able this dis@@ able , you get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can obtain useful results by calling a photo with the shar@@ ps advertising . you can view it with the menu entry more effectively . &quot;
&quot; however , they should deal with caution , as the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the edge of edges , but also increases the noise . in general , the most useful technique to sharp@@ ly focus on the tool . you can easily attain more information and a comparison of all techniques for grin@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ ack@@ ly . the solution to draw the image a little soft , is much easier than it increases . use the tool for soft@@ ness with the menu button lighter and experiment with you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter un@@ sharp mas@@ quer@@ ade is a very good tool to remove vei@@ ls from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the image . the showcase shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values are creating good results and should get tried out first . an increase in radius or the amount increases the effect . if you make the in@@ ex@@ y mask , the noise and the impression of gr@@ ats are in the proximity of sharp edges . &quot;
the radius represents a few pixels on each side of a channel by the filters . high resolution images allow bigger radi@@ i . they therefore should sharp@@ ens them pictures at the best in their final resolution .
&quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the original one that is added to the original , thereby the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the Corpor@@ a value is a break from the maximum R@@ GB value and to apply differential amount . one can therefore define a minimum difference between the killing of the filter . in this way areas with a soft switch between the killing of shar@@ ps , and hence beauty error in virtu@@ es , He@@ aven@@ ues and water @-@ surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ quer@@ ade filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a pig value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation came ; tool re@@ focused on a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ right@@ ed degre@@ asing filter and algorith@@ m from Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool is trying to re@@ generate an image &amp; quot ; this is a better approach than just trying the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vienna Filter@@ ing . it makes use of a technique called F@@ IR Vienna Filter@@ ing . it uses the traditional technique of bl@@ ur@@ red mask . you can start using it from the menu by drawing colors and focus on image editing .
&quot; in practice the circular flows work much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result of the original pi@@ xel which is far influenced by the original pi@@ xel . the F@@ IR Vienna in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen F@@ altung will be influenced in most cases even very heavily from the remote pi@@ xel . it causes unwanted results . &quot;
circular thr@@ ust : this is the radius of circular flow . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images the default value should result in good results . you can insert a higher value if your image is very bl@@ ur@@ red then however on Hei@@ ligen@@ sch@@ eine .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help to reduce art@@ e@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1 , &amp; eg ; add and count . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the sharp@@ ness effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; Rau@@ sch@@ ect : an increase in smoking filter can help you reduce art@@ e@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the filter quality is very bad . a good value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will be added to the image even further . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ e@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal to zero , you might need to increase the cor@@ relation and / o@@ der@@ den noise filter . &quot;
&quot; mattress size : this value determines the size of the transformation type : this value determines good results , especially if you select great values for the circular thr@@ ust or the pal@@ ate &apos;s fl@@ ap . however , note that the module is very slow when you choose big values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the saving as and charging buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any application @-@ focused parameters that you have set will be saved for later and can be loaded later .
&quot; try all the pieces , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before you use the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that lots of operations changes that are not immediately visible immediately , but left un@@ pleas@@ ant@@ e@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; when you are reading and com@@ press , and eg ; as JP@@ EG , you should use the module to the un@@ com@@ pressed picture . &quot;
&quot; generally produced , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ quer@@ ade better results as sharp@@ ness . this could be caused by bl@@ ur@@ red masks for a bigger neighborhood than sh@@ aking . &quot;
&quot; theoretically , a bl@@ ur@@ red mask must always produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of in@@ tox@@ ins . for the Vienna filter you can show that it is the optimal liner notes . the F@@ IR Vienna filter is often better with the processing of small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp color picture that needs to be corrected . this picture was done with a analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for auto @-@ focus lens .
you can read a technical comparison to this address for more information on the Sch@@ är@@ vi @-@ Sur@@ gery in digital pictures .
the regul@@ ator smooth@@ es sets the in@@ sharp@@ ness of the area of the fores@@ aw in order to generate a natural mon@@ up@@ ille .
&quot; colour tin@@ ent enables a adapted colour for the p@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark dark , then you can set this here . &quot;
the tool sc@@ ap@@ y correction is one of the most developed tools to remove the desired arti@@ facts with un@@ parall@@ eled speed .
the phot@@ ovoltai@@ c algorith@@ m was developed by the IM@@ AG@@ E team of the REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains several pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available preferences are covered below :
if you want to use the filter@@ ing settings for a j@@ us@@ ? you can use the rider Gl@@ ue and advanced settings .
&quot; Detail@@ obtain p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a even more homogen@@ eous surface of the picture . a value of 0,@@ 9 should obtain details such . a value of 0.7 should be necessary . please note that the details can always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated . &quot;
driving dependen@@ cy Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es in all directions while a value close to 1 is only in one direction . if you have a film @-@ gr@@ itt or C@@ CD Rau@@ ts will produce a high value tick @-@ like pattern . JP@@ EG art@@ e@@ facts are best eliminated in a value near 1 .
&quot; smooth@@ ed &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this puts the maximum rotation factor above all else@@ . then set this value to the degree of smoking in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is estimated , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s effect , it needs to be set higher than 3 . &quot;
repeti@@ tions : on how often the algorith@@ m passes through . normally here is 1 or 2 .
&quot; angle @-@ wide da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is small chosen , it should also be small for a long run . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral part &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral ped@@ est@@ on in pixels . you should add the value of small 1 to avoid Sub @-@ pi@@ xel smooth@@ ing and never exceed 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the More about quality that you get by selecting this option is only small . he doubles however the run time . we recommend it to allow him .
the buttons save as and store just make this . any attitude of the faul@@ ts can correct this in a text file and later loaded again .
&quot; photo error is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take a long time and a high CPU load on it . hence , you can ab@@ ort the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b . &quot;
below you can see how to remove photo faul@@ ts with Small art@@ e@@ facts . the module is used on a photo that was taken in Guatemala City with an an@@ alogue camera . how to see there is a peculi@@ ar black arti@@ fact that is caused by a bad film storage during the trip . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation came ; Rau@@ sch@@ reduction is a very powerful tool to decrease image smoking . it uses a copy@@ right@@ ed algorith@@ m by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filter at your disposal to remove st@@ ains and other art@@ e@@ facts , for example from dust or hair on the lens , it can also be used to remove sensory perception of the camera or Mo@@ i@@ al@@ ign ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sensors in digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screens@@ hot top shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ting smoking which can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings may remain in default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time needed by the filter per pi@@ xel and can control the image and the color in it will spread over the picture and the color in it will be seized and therefore minor error . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the shell@@ fish level . this value consists of the pix@@ el@@ ab@@ ed base . if it is lifted up , smo@@ k@@ heads is deleted . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer receive and cra@@ yon or lubric@@ ate it again . &quot;
edges : controls the edge @-@ accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if he is too strong can not remove the whole ro@@ ar or ob@@ ble @-@ shapes can occur . put it on a value close to the max@@ im or JP@@ EG @-@ art@@ e@@ facts want to remove without details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance intoler@@ ance of the image . we recommend you to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve one image . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
color : controls the color @-@ toler@@ ance of the image . we recommend you change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve one image . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
&quot; Gamma : controls the gam@@ ma @-@ intoler@@ ance of the picture . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark areas , which typically dis@@ car@@ ts stronger , but he w@@ ren@@ es also the Sch@@ atten@@ fall . &quot;
&quot; absorption : controls the gran@@ ting of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ uri@@ ous absorption . this value is defined as fast the adap@@ tive filter radius to occur on variations of lumin@@ ance . if he is lifted up to his minimum , smoking and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter may appear to the edges . he can remove smoking tips and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : these buttons are used precisely for this . all parameters for smoking reduction , which you have set may be saved into the fil@@ es@@ ystem and later loaded . &quot;
this is an example of how smoking @-@ reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the smoke reduction was used with default settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is too cr@@ ack@@ ly for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft , is fortunately much easier than an image to sharp@@ ly . use the tool@@ bar on the right of the dialog box shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photographs .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s diamond , com@@ pression , com@@ pression , com@@ pression , com@@ pression , and subsequently removed the content as well as the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the same algorith@@ m can be used for color and textures , using a different tool , the error correction , carried out . the algorith@@ m was developed by the IM@@ AG@@ E team of the REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ or@@ ich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; JP@@ EG art@@ e@@ facts reduce : the com@@ pression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss subject , he creates some com@@ pres@@ sions &amp; quot ; arti@@ facts . - small standards that are in un@@ com@@ pressed picture . this attitude is intended to correct these problems . &quot;
the buttons save as and shop just make this . any setting of photo @-@ restoration can be saved into a text file and later loaded again .
&quot; photo @-@ restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take a long time and a high CPU load on it . hence , you can ab@@ ort the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
below you can see how a photo with uni@@ formity will be reduced . the module is applied to a black and white picture that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film gr@@ itt ( 1 ) and corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo @-@ restoration . this time textures was reduced to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ e@@ facts created by the scanning lighting and phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ans ; tool hot@@ pi@@ xel does allow hot@@ pi@@ xel of photos that have been plug@@ ged with a C@@ CD camera to be eight . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pix@@ i project that are copy@@ right@@ ed by Martin Dick@@ optical p .
&quot; bright , total or hot pixels are particularly high in high @-@ quality raw files , a problem because lots of cameras with JP@@ EG com@@ pression over an built @-@ in repression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; to remove a photo with a dark picture sub@@ method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the button dark . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pi@@ xel . these are highlighted in the picture show .
if you have an old digital camera it is important to record the dark picture directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pi@@ xel through C@@ CD defects .
&quot; first described , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching picture to the correc@@ tive picture . an automatic processing of the dark picture will be the bad record . please note that the wiz@@ ard loads the last dark picture and this automatically invites you to the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview help you correct within the picture the result is correct . the down@@ side shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are out in all the predic@@ tions .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filters method to inter@@ pol@@ ate this pix@@ el@@ blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ing : it is determined an average of the neighboring mode . the resulting color will al@@ locate all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this will be separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels which have a gap of 1 from the pix@@ el@@ block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels on the block .
square : this is the standard filter@@ ing method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less for pix@@ el@@ block will be used to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels on the block .
Cub@@ an : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be used to calculate a bi @-@ cub@@ an surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels on the block .
&quot; below you can see the hot@@ pi@@ xel correction to a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure to see . the original image was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) , and the corrected picture is under ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation came ; Vign@@ et@@ ti@@ correction is a tool to correct the labels , i.e. under@@ going corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; fores@@ ight lenses , especially the middle and large photo format , can often be illuminated in the middle and large photo format . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ il@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ ady ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that the sensor can reduce there . &quot;
&quot; but he also has dis@@ advantages . many centers @-@ filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at Bl@@ ending filter , which should keep it impossible to hold the camera with the hand . fores@@ aw objective , even with center @-@ filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise nonsense effect can arise . &quot;
&quot; with the large round @-@ series areas of today &apos;s fil@@ tration areas and color scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Center@@ filter by applied to a raw image which is made without these filters . algorith@@ m uses the tool module with a Center@@ filter on an image . the algorith@@ m is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can control the module @-@ reg@@ im@@ correction filter and then monitor the exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light@@ ening absorption at the point of the biggest density the filter . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , which is an optical filter with a aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or acci@@ dental to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of vi@@ val , cut it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ osity , contrast and Gamma settings : the editing of an image with the labels correction reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you must re@@ configure the exposure of the target image with these options , as you only need to raise the settings only . &quot;
if you want a refin@@ ement of exposure of the target images so let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / gam@@ ma at zero and use the gr@@ ad@@ ation from the &amp; digi@@ tization ; Picture Edit@@ ing from the menu color Gr@@ ad@@ ation .
this is an example of Vign@@ a correc@@ tions on an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the labels in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ aire and contrast @-@ correction has also been performed in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation came ; Lin@@ sen@@ ver@@ zer@@ ies is a tool to correct the effect of cel@@ esti@@ al l@@ enti@@ ls on photos . it uses a copy@@ right@@ ed algorith@@ m by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . colour break@@ down can not be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second Gr@@ ades treat the general geomet@@ ric version of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ v@@ exe form of the picture .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third Gr@@ ades has a similar score , however at the edges . this correction is not used in the tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient fourth Gr@@ ades corrected the distant corners to the part of the second Gr@@ ades . if you combine these two can be any geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion nearly eliminated .
&quot; general : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the second Gr@@ ades . with negative values , T@@ onn@@ age can be corrected , and positive values are ho@@ vering . &quot;
corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion fourth Gr@@ ades . this value works more strongly in the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &quot; Cor@@ ners parameters has posted the parameters of the parameter . &quot;
z@@ oom : this value Deli@@ vering the image size new and thus leads the correction to the first wheel through . negative values enlarge while positive the image res@@ ides .
lumin@@ ous : this value j@@ us@@ ates the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter@@ ing settings , the dialogue with a preview the refin@@ ing correction . the values you use for your image are stored and used when the next start is used as default values . &quot;
the tonn@@ ages or cus@@ hion @-@ shaped correction should be carried out before all random or size changes . at the best you perform this correction as any first time . if you re@@ generate a picture and then perform a cut @-@ shaped correction the effect of the Fal@@ se .
&quot; to help you find the best correction to you . move the mouse @-@ hand in the picture show around the top edge or building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the T@@ onn@@ et / cus@@ hion form with the help of the lines . &quot;
if you correct a cus@@ pi@@ ical distor@@ tion the resulting image will have black corners . you can trans@@ forming this with the cutting tool in the menu or remove it from image editing or on the z@@ oom regul@@ ator of this dialog .
&quot; for most images the T@@ onn@@ y @-@ shaped correction is made . the next logical step for some motives , such as recordings of front , frames and paintings , it is the prospect of correct that all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that when you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the tonn@@ @-@ shaped correction to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture under ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorith@@ m is based on a method for simul@@ ating infr@@ ared tu@@ u@@ .org web site which is accessible from this URL . the filter re@@ produces the familiar Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ i@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity area of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below preview you can set two parameters set @-@ gr@@ itt and film @-@ sensitivity ( ISO ) . activ@@ ating the activ@@ ist texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller changes the amount of fil@@ ets and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows become white like snow !
&quot; since the filter paint channels to reproduce by Infr@@ ared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to use the effect on black / white photos , as the color will be missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infr@@ ared fil@@ me@@ ch applied to a landsc@@ ap@@ ing photo from New Zealand . the original image is placed under ( 1 ) and the processed image under ( 2 ) . higher ISO values produce a kind of au@@ ra in the back@@ light .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter fil@@ eke@@ eping is an easy to use tool to reproduce film gr@@ itt like e.g. the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of films mix the manufacturers large silver @-@ gra@@ ins of the photo@@ em@@ ul@@ sion .
&quot; the film Cor@@ alia gives your photo a certain atmosphere or seems to move back into the past . when you want to get rid of this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular sight of specially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos , so you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regul@@ ator the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the Kör@@ ner can be calibr@@ ated . the default value is , although often higher values need to be required , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more Kör@@ ner , then you can use the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film di@@ still@@ ery on a black / white picture applied . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited ( 2 ) . the user @-@ touch@@ able film is equivalent to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ tization : filter oil paintings produces the appearance of an oil painting . it used to make a copy@@ right@@ ed algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ tization : filter oil paintings gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature images and s@@ ane are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two Reg@@ ul@@ ators to influence this effect . the upper choosing the brush size between one and five out . thick@@ ets are better for large images . smooth@@ es the smooth@@ es or , from the other side , the hin@@ ge . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processing is with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation came ; filter carbon drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient . the lines that define the outlines in the drawing , are therefore not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful when you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch of you . this would be good pictures to start . &quot;
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators with a value range from 1 to 100 , to control this effect . the upper regul@@ ator sel@@ ects the stit@@ ching size and the lower j@@ us@@ hed the contrast ( smooth@@ ed ) . &quot;
this is an example of the coher@@ ent filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the altered image ( 2 ) . default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by modification of the intensity .
the &amp; digi@@ tization also engra@@ ving your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it used to make a copy@@ right@@ ed algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . he works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where colour is not the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity , to transform the image into a grey , mo@@ dar@@ ily landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows the contrast to the filter@@ ing . a value of 30 , equivalent to 10 % , is the default . &quot;
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the depth is 10 % .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into an art work by means of distor@@ ting effects . it is used by proprietary algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
wave @-@ blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and makes it look like it is seen by gl@@ ass@@ blocks .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : analog to the wave @-@ blocks 1 is distor@@ ted the image here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can ab@@ ort these effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of in@@ duc@@ ting effect . it uses copy@@ right@@ ed algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
z@@ oom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ red the picture along star @-@ shaped lines that go from a center . this simul@@ ates a zo@@ om@@ ental camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often in the sport photography .
radi@@ al in@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ red the image by rotation of the pi@@ xel to a center . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ fs of a revol@@ ving camera .
removing red : wi@@ red the picture to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to come back into the background .
&quot; movement @-@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ped the picture by horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a linear movements , z : B : from a car or train photograph , camera . &quot;
&quot; soft@@ ness In@@ sp@@ ins : wi@@ red the picture soft into the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and sh@@ iny soft focus effect ( Hamilton Eff@@ ect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or to add a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
&quot; sho@@ ok di@@ shar@@ per : wi@@ ped the image by random shift of pixels , and simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a random moving camera . &quot;
intelligent in@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the color @-@ basin in the picture and wi@@ g@@ ish them without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then generate it , with an average pi@@ xel value , new . &quot;
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore de@@ break this calculation at any time with the button .
the rain drops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your picture . this gives it natural your images a big look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected by protected algorith@@ m .
&quot; dri@@ lls size allows the size of the drop to change . since the dri@@ lls size does not automatically increase the size for small images , it changes the number and density of drop . fishing changes the optical effect of drops on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can keep using the &amp; digi@@ tization ; picture editing a area free of rain drops . use the tool for example , to select the area , for example a face which will be free to stay free from rain drops . &quot;
this is an example of rain drops . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
when the photo has the wrong orientation then you can get it through mir@@ rors or rotating in the right orientation . the tools can be transformed in the menu or transform the mir@@ rors .
photo magni@@ fying is definitely one of the most advanced tools to increase a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; a painting is simple . the big question is , how can you keep an image bl@@ iss@@ ful and the details are sharp ? how can you find the missing information or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g @-@ algorith@@ m of this is used here makes a good work . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; when a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select the size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below . &quot;
&quot; the tool to change the size is using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pi@@ xel . if you want a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to bl@@ ush . &quot;
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation for example Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . the underlying algorith@@ m photo was developed by the IM@@ AG@@ E team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g Project .
you must tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the rider new size and are en@@ umer@@ ated below :
&quot; if this option is enabled , when entering the new size is the aspect ratio of the original size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is estimated , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ b effect , it needs to be set higher than 3 . &quot;
buttons Save as and store are used precisely for this . each entry for photo can be saved as a text file and later loaded .
&quot; photo sho@@ cks is very fast in what it does , but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load after it . you can ab@@ ort the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b . &quot;
you can see below an example of photo shooting using a small colour image to double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard En@@ lar@@ ging En@@ lar@@ gement .
&quot; cutting of a photo is not only a common operation , but also a commonly under@@ estimated tool to compile a picture . the image editing this very simple . to create a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and move the rect@@ angle , then you &apos;ll see this case while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you get rid of the mouse again , the area of the photo will cut off . therefore , you &apos;ll get a good overview of how your photo will cut off . you can create the size of the square , by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle , simply pull it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the touch , use the button &quot; T@@ tr@@ l &quot; button in tool@@ bar and the photo will be tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file stor@@ ing and save the file to save the newly @-@ pped photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preceding area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you defined in dialogue will remain . &quot;
&quot; in the tool post @-@ ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format , the larger value of the height and the width is assigned to the width . &quot;
&quot; the tool to cut off aspect ratio is using a relative aspect ratio . that means it is always equal to whether you can use centimeters , ink or any other physical size . for example , you can see a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to run the selection automatically horizontal or vertical .
&quot; bottom in dialog , you can set the area with the Max . ratio kno@@ b the area for cutting on the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool to cut off ratio sets its settings depending on the orientation ( horiz@@ ont@@ ally or vertical ) . if you use the cutting system , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the modified designs are retri@@ ev@@ able in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data are recycl@@ ed and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the aid assistance enable help to show your images better , so that you are better able to put your images better . &quot;
&quot; harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third leg , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles in the diag@@ onal tri@@ angles . &quot;
&quot; Golden Center : the Golden Center is a division which is on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us sea , or the blast@@ oc@@ ets of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all kinds of things we find as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Golden partition is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used already with the ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to re@@ use your temple and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is guided by the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . from where every number is followed by the sum of its two proceeding . one composition that follows this rule is regarded as visual harmon@@ ious . &quot;
the golden centre puts the liquid lines available if you put a picture together . these aid are en@@ umer@@ ated below :
the Golden Spir@@ als will bring you to your target good results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ reg@@ el the golden spiral creates a liquid line which leads to the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the view of the spect@@ ator along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual river .
&quot; another rule is the right corner of the golden spiral , also called Golden rect@@ angle . it should give something that the eye is at the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this something can simply be there without the eye , it will fulfil its task . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles also run from the above golden spiral cycles . their ver@@ tex points are the middle points of the sides of the golden tri@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not syn@@ win@@ k@@ able tri@@ angles . di@@ agon@@ als can be placed on these lines . di@@ agon@@ als can be placed on these lines . &quot;
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break up your frame create an effect of professional photographers with dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your image eye on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition you can not achieve differently .
the options Horiz@@ ont@@ ally reflect and Ver@@ tical can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ious divisions .
&quot; with the button of color , you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast , the guides can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to rot@@ ate an image around any corner .
&quot; when you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera not exactly vertical or horiz@@ ont@@ ally . this creates an image in which the things came around a corner ; picture editing and the tool @-@ free rotation . select it with the free rotation and hit the target corner . &quot;
rot@@ ate your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are given in degrees . with the button pres@@ ets you can put the sli@@ der back to 0 degree . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top .
&quot; for your help , the module Free Rot@@ ation provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse @-@ hand in the picture show around the two lines . now you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now hit the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
after you filmed a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair it is to transform the function transform@@ ations from sculp@@ tor .
&quot; an elegant way to cut the image is the function Autom@@ atically al@@ cutting . select one of the following options : &quot;
the option Anti @-@ ali@@ asing is the image a bit depending on the rotation . but please note the above warning .
all per@@ il@@ able transform@@ ations are performed by a fix@@ ation of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right of the dialogue you will find some information which will help you change the perspective :
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty spaces that have ar@@ isen through the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty spaces that have ar@@ isen through the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the trans@@ forming area .
angle on the top : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the trans@@ forming area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the trans@@ forming area .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the trans@@ forming area .
&quot; after the adjustment of the perspective the image will be a bit dis@@ rup@@ tive . for each individual adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double the effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
after which you have adapted the perspective you get unbe@@ atable tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to regret it is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers from the image processing .
&quot; the tool system is used to move a part of the picture in one direction and move the other part toward the opposite direction . it is not a rotation , the image is distor@@ ted in a parall@@ el@@ og@@ ram . you can trans@@ forming this module via transform@@ ers . &quot;
change your image by pressing the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . you can push horiz@@ ont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . a preview of the effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target image will appear on the right of the screen .
&quot; to your help you will find an vertical and horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool for your image . &quot;
&quot; after which you carried out the che@@ eses , the image will be a bit ru@@ sty . for a single shift that effect is usually neglected , but two verti@@ ces are twice as much conf@@ ection@@ ery and hence you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after shr@@ inking , the picture has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with transform@@ es from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; you came to read and write a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way that these libraries were comp@@ iling . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of formats with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on this site . however , you will always find JP@@ EG and T@@ IF@@ F . &quot;
&quot; when extension came , only files in formats used to know . this happens in the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension got listed in the list . you can change this list of file extension that came , accept . in the section configuration you can find more information . &quot;
almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras allow you to select even the format used . a detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ tised ; supports both formats .
image com@@ pression is the use of data com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ism on digital pictures . thereby redund@@ ant information is reduced in order to save the image data to an efficient way .
&quot; JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . in general , there is better , smooth@@ ed results as JP@@ EG under the same comp@@ utation . the 200@@ 0s version can also save even if this is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about raw materials , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw image pictures in JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F with the raw converter of &amp; digi@@ tised . in the section configuration you will find further information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; &amp; nbsp ; supports the loading of raw materials only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is in &amp; digi@@ tization ; all support cameras can be seen below on the web @-@ side of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of raw formats found by &amp; digi@@ tization : &quot;
many digital cameras are supporting the recording of short films . these clips are frequently stored on Avi@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . read these formats and therefore does not have any built @-@ in options to display or edit . if you click on a movie file which you want to play on a movie file to start playing the program .
move forward to the previous album in the chron@@ icle . you can only go forward if you have gone back before .
synchron@@ ize the met@@ ad@@ ata between the database and all the files of the current window . pictures er@@ ches the met@@ ad@@ ata of the database and not different as with this menu .
&quot; menu entry of the K@@ IP@@ I module for manual , automatic tw@@ ist / mirror for the current image based on orientation in the EX@@ IF information . &quot;

&quot; starting the equal of all met@@ ad@@ ata between the database and all the files , i.e. not only those in the current view as with this menu . the met@@ ad@@ ata database is over@@ written by the data of the files in devi@@ ations . the other variant can be started from the menu album . &quot;
all con@@ fig@@ uri@@ ed cameras will be en@@ umer@@ ated here . you can add the entry camera out of the menu to add a new camera to the list . please see the camera &apos;s camera according to further information .
K@@ IP@@ I module combines a series of images in a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Earth .
&quot; if you are changing the steps 4 and 5 you can do good when the initi@@ als was already very good , then you can carry out the first four options with the module white balance . &quot;
many tools you need the photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ tization ; describe your description here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ness , soft@@ ness , rough@@ ening , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ ting , &amp; etc ; . use a single dialogue type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the actual picture . below you see &quot; &quot; Cre@@ denti@@ fied &quot; &quot; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current picture . links of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the pre @-@ man@@ age@@ field . these modes are :
vertical without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right indicates the filter to the area on the right of the selected pres@@ tige area .
horizontal without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter is applied to the range below the selected pres@@ tige area .
vertical . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
&quot; divide , the upper area shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter . &quot;
&quot; mouse over &apos; style : displays the preview when the mouse is not in the pres@@ tige , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can turn on to show off and under@@ exposure . the colours used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame for the selection of the preview . you can draw this frame with the mouse within the picture and see in the part of the picture you want to see . the Pre@@ view in the left part of dialogue will immediately be updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower right corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all settings from the last use of the module can be painted .
the side@@ bar features reveal the essential information about the selected image and is largely explan@@ atory : it is group@@ ed into the following sections :
&quot; photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters in the shooting of the photo . these data are written by the EX@@ IF data , if they are available . &quot;
this rider provides an intuitive card vehicle based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can pull off with the mouse wheel or drag and move it . move it while you are fil@@ tered and displayed on the left mouse button . all images inside this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . this will naturally pres@@ upp@@ oses your paintings ge@@ o data .
&amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to manipul@@ ate color pal@@ ettes and to choose and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pall@@ ets files , which are from &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot user defined color and user @-@ defined colors . &quot;
&quot; in dialog , you can choose from a list of installed pall@@ ets , or browse the folder files . &quot;
the c@@ ursor is shown in the pall@@ et view as line . it can be moved by cli@@ cked down in the area next to a color .
it indicates the color of the color and the color is described below the pall@@ et view . here also the color name can be changed .
&quot; it can also be used to choose from . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the c@@ ursor into it . afterwards , move the mouse with penet@@ rated left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the mixing @-@ box is inserted under the button color , the color is inserted from the color panel at c@@ ursor . the color will either be inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode is selected either . this mode can set you by selecting the cross@@ ings and write under Bei@@ m c@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions of copying , cutting and inser@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; &amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color follows three values for the share of red , green and blue , and an optional coloured sign , if another color follows . if so , three numer@@ ical values are followed in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; included . &quot;
the colors in the palette and the color selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
&quot; select one color somewhere on the screen , and then you can find the colour selection on the left side . &quot;
&quot; graphs are a KDE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ design ; graphs are free layout programs . graphs are free layout programs . graphs are available in science , especially in science , and so far , there was not a modern &amp; GUI ; program to graph@@ ically visu@@ alize graphics &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; nbsp viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programmes through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
and graph@@ ically inter@@ viewer : is a KDE program for the viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs ; the graphic programs are free layout programs . show graph with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; to . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graphs in &amp; Kate ; ( graph@@ ers and re@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; Kate ; to open or to open the graphs in &amp; pot ; in a &amp; Kate ; -@@ component to open

&quot; more required software : &amp; calibr@@ ation ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program , which requires the &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs requirements . in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window indicates the open graphs , each in its own window . at first , when you start &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; in this case the tool@@ bar only file the icon file and the ( empty ) list included in the file . click on the first symbol to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the bottom of the screens@@ hot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is bigger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the mouse is using ( high and down without special buttons , left and right at the sto@@ op@@ ed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the file has just changed in a file @-@ viewer ; loaded file from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the Grap@@ h should be re@@ loaded or want to ignore the change . if you decide to change your decision later . if you decide to change your decision later , you can set up the menu item settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a Graph@@ end@@ at@@ ei outside of an ongoing &amp; cot viewer ; eg ; on the file &apos;s browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; post @-@ viewer ; -@@ instance , or to provide the graph in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the dialog dialog . &quot;
&quot; at program start , you can open all the graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the Grap@@ h should be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of graphs that are to be fitted on a page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the relevant parts of the graph . &quot;
page front page with one on several pages shared with no head@@ line and with another type of font .
&quot; the site again shop gives the possibility to set the behavior if a file has been modified on the hard disk , and eg ; from another program . you can define a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or the program for any time . &quot;
&quot; the page opening gives the possibility to set the behavior of a graph@@ ite inter@@ viewer ; if a graph out of a running session is opened . you can open a standard behavior for this case ( the graphs in a new window , or determine in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked . &quot;
&quot; the site seating management gives the possibility to set the Start@@ ing of &amp; gig@@ gl@@ viewer ; you can specify a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) , or determine at each start afterwards . &quot;
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , opens up additional possibilities : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout , select the entries as they are on the website of &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z ; are : &quot;
&amp; dot ; -@@ algorith@@ m ; the standard for state graphs . he produces hierarch@@ ical or dex@@ tr@@ ated depic@@ tions of judicial graphs . the algorith@@ m sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as a few cant@@ een .
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorith@@ m is the standard for un@@ just graphs . it produces depic@@ tions in accordance with the ank@@ le model . here , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai @-@ algorith@@ m uses , the equivalent is with statisti@@ cally multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP ; -@@ algorith@@ m produces a spr@@ ing@@ y graph a jump @-@ model tool layout . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ mo@@ ur@@ ring for the treatment of large and g@@ ec@@ l@@ ust@@ ered graphs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorith@@ m uses the k@@ not @-@ circular to according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kau@@ ff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . he is useful for certain diagrams by multiple cy@@ c@@ lical structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog in which you will be able to specify a layout command , which will then be executed by a shell , and the calculated layout of graphs after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can change its parameters , or even graphs with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of graphs ( directed or un@@ just ) and uses the default algorithms for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ just graphs ) . &quot;

&amp; cre@@ graphic viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tools to display . it requires the following programs :
a special setup is not necessary to use a graphical viewer ; in the menu settings you will find further options .
&quot; the main window of the symbol Edit@@ ors is divided into five parts : the main tool@@ bar , the bar for string tools , the status bar , the pall@@ ets , and the Git@@ etz , where you draw the symbol . &quot;
&quot; created a new symbol . when the current file has been modified , you are asked if you want to save the changes . afterwards , a dialog , where you can choose whether the icon will be created from a template , or whether you want to start new . &quot;
&quot; represents the last revers@@ ed step again . if you do not have taken a step back , this function is disabled . &quot;
adds the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
&quot; this puts the current symbol in grey . this can create colors , which do not match with those of the icon range of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;
&quot; not changing the symbol , but sets the current character color on the color of the point that you click here . &quot;
&quot; the status bar shows you the current promotions . from left to right , it shows you the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pix@@ els , the size of the current character , the magnific@@ ation factor and the current number of colors of the symbol . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module photos read tools to provide new images and request them .
&quot; this module can be used to include new images , and ab@@ ide by external sources . currently , two sources can be used : &quot;
scan sc@@ ans : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner which supported by the SAN@@ E project or with another source like Video Stre@@ ams . this makes you need K@@ oo@@ ka and SAN@@ E installed .
&quot; when you open the menu item images , a dialog , which you can choose between all available sources on your machine . select the source from which you want to pick the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; then you can replace the K@@ oo@@ ka window by replacing the pre @-@ set default values and adjust the area to your needs , before you check with the button . the estimated file size will be shown in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information . &quot;
make sure the window will be completely displayed as some settings otherwise ev@@ able .
&quot; after having pushed the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan completed and the window will specify the options of the target file . here you can select the com@@ pression and type of image file . here you can also select the com@@ pression and type of image file . you will also have to select the folder &amp; # 160 , or create the folder . &quot;
&quot; for the screens@@ hot , you can create according to you in the menu of Im@@ por@@ tier@@ - &gt; screens@@ hot ... a window appears in which you can set the different displays of the screens@@ hot : &quot;
select the complete work@@ space to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all own program window are selected , the retri@@ ev@@ able program disappear , so that you can see other displays and windows . otherwise , you will read , after a short delay , the currently visible work place . if you have read the complete work@@ space , only the window will be read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screens@@ hot is waiting before it starts . if you need to switch on other work@@ spaces , you should select this delay highly enough to get the time to navigate there . &quot;
&quot; after the screens@@ hot , the dialog options of the target program was released with the options described above . &quot;

&quot; select the pictures you want to cor@@ relation in the main window and give the menu on . the top to the visual dialog will then load . to load a split file with GP@@ X file . this file contains , of course , data that were at the same time in the same places as the images of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the file load , an automatic cor@@ relation carried out the coordinates in red . GPS sp@@ ur@@ data are recorded at GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera amounts to be performed with the GMT . this can be performed with the time@@ zone . place here your camera zone . &quot;
the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera results . lies the vari@@ ance below are the data gathered together . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no spam data from one place for images you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the difference of 2000 seconds then will cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
&quot; the options Inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have any suitable data . if you know that in reality , a loc@@ ation in a large difference between camera and GPS , you can put these boundaries here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos on the same place . since dialogue takes the coordinates from a call to another , you just need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the loc@@ ation can also be found with the shown map and to be found . select the relevant region and enlarge you si@@ e.@@ guide this again and again through , until you will be selected manually . the map needs to be changed manually . the map can be changed manually . the map can be changed between map , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , you can hang out the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the exi@@ f@@ tool used to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML sites .
&quot; this module can export your albums on a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01 . you can select the albums that you select as HTML pages , and the character set shall provide UT@@ F @-@ 8 , in order to enable the best possible internation@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; the module has four rider in which the settings may be customized . the tab sel@@ ections allows all albums to select to HTML . you can quickly select a large number of albums on the right . in the section below , the Al@@ ben@@ chmarks and the text of the files will appear in the top of the HTML page . &quot;
&quot; the rider image defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option for each image creates a page created in which the picture is displayed . otherwise , the picture is displayed directly with your default image , &amp; eg ; Co@@ ick@@ show , displayed &quot;
&quot; the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your associated images . for this , select a folder on which you have writing . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export that contains everything will be created . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF @-@ Information of your original images are also stored in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with other colours , you can change the default colors . naturally , the file size also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the rider visu@@ als allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the records , which are small images displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window indicates the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
&quot; if the module creates the pages automatically closed the window will not automatically closed , so you can determine whether errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will start automatically in the end to preview the preview of the gallery . press En@@ ters to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I imag@@ ery is a very fast and flexible OpenGL based tool to look at pictures .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I imag@@ ery allows it to watch a selection of images and use upon them base oper@@ ations such as screen@@ ings , zo@@ oming or le@@ aning . the viewer is used with short and mouse clicks . it has been designed for a quick indicator and quick access to its functions . &quot;
after starting a picture is shown by default in the full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JP@@ EG @-@ free module is a tool to change images without com@@ promising your quality .
&quot; this module allows you to save images in JP@@ EG format , without the usual losses to quality or met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of the lost @-@ free storage is that the file size is increasing , as no com@@ pression of color information takes place . this can be found e.g. at the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera cable is a tool that allows you to connect to your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera update currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org. &quot;
&quot; currently , the K@@ IP@@ I module does not currently have documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I @-@ team . &quot;
&quot; with the import -@@ function of the met@@ ad@@ ata module , you can copy the data from one image to another . select the image and then call on the import feature , i.e. the image to copy the met@@ ad@@ ata . the data is copied after that you have pushed the button OK . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work in all formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write in any target format . JP@@ EG is supported by writing . please look at exi@@ v@@ 2 , to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a sli@@ deshow .
&quot; the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG @-@ video , using a defined length , using a defined length , which allows the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . between the individual images you can also add a base menu in MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV of the sli@@ deshow . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically matched to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the sli@@ deshow . with this module , you can create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
you must first choose the pictures to be packed into the MPEG sli@@ deshow . afterwards you can create via Extr@@ as MPEG sli@@ deshow .
the images selected by you are en@@ umer@@ ated under image files in your portfolio . there you can also change sor@@ ting the images or the contents of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should custom@@ ize the other settings . the video format can choose from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds that will indicate a picture below . a low value creates a sudden , a high contrast is very smooth and imag@@ inary . &quot;
the background color can be adjusted as next . in doubt you should let them black . the name and the path of the generated file can be set by name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep in mind as cr@@ acking .
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio file , then it will be integrated into the movie . depending on the speed of your machine , you can then walk a coffee with the button . depending on the speed of your machine you can get a coffee and enjoy the sli@@ deshow whenever you are back again . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the button settings right below . &quot;
&quot; the printer assist@@ ent allows you to print several pictures on a sheet of paper , along with standard images . these combined images can also automatically be opened automatically with the image machine . this is e.@@ g : sense to improve or printing the Gimp module for direct expression . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import your saved images stored in one of three formats JP@@ EG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command head@@ lines d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . an original version of Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it will be the same results as the software from your camera player . sometimes , get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! &quot;
&quot; first , select the raw file that is to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window appears then in the mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can preview the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now optim@@ ise the values newly in order to optimize the con@@ versions into the con@@ versions . the key parameters such as Gamma , brightness and Red / blue can be activated . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later on . &quot;
a four @-@ color R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to enable you to use the contrac@@ tion . if your camera works in R@@ GB mode the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the con@@ versions . JP@@ EG uses a lost algorith@@ m and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the tag@@ ged image format , T@@ IF@@ F , ret@@ ains all the information of your image and uses the Lost L@@ Z@@ W . &quot;
&quot; if you intend to use your images frequently , or you should use later to continue to use the JP@@ EG format since it is limited only a limited number of operations before the picture quality is deterior@@ ating . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
if you choose to choose JP@@ EG as a memory format the met@@ ad@@ ata is stored in the RA@@ W file in the JP@@ EG file in the dat@@ ashe@@ et .
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start with the kno@@ b kno@@ b the conversion . if you want to ab@@ ort this process again , you can in@@ v@@ om@@ it . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ ile processing mode allows you to convert different pictures at one time . therefore , use this mode for example when you are safe , e.g. by testing in a single picture which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have here the possibility to automatically write file automatically . however , a preview is not available . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to re@@ com@@ press all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following formats are supported :
&quot; this module can ren@@ ame the ren@@ aming of all images of an album . you can fix the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
&quot; this module can be used to modify the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can enlarge the image size or enlarge . in addition , four types of image change are made available : &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format . &quot;
not proportional : dis@@ proportionate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; print preparation : preparing the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the phot@@ op@@ api@@ ers . target picture , including background size , boundary size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can submit selected images to your preferred E @-@ Mail program . it is also possible to modify the size of the listed pictures in advance . further pictures can drag on to the list of the pictures and lay there . &quot;
&quot; after which you started the module , the image window will be displayed with the pictures selected by you . you can add more pictures with a file @-@ dial dialog box . for the last chosen picture , a preview is displayed on the right . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can also drag images on the picture list and add it to the pictures below . &quot;
&quot; with the button image , you will remove the pictures from the list of the pictures listed below . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected all the images , you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail page with the button . you only have to add the addresses and the Bet@@ re@@ ff . the pictures selected are attached to the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; do not make sure to send out too many pictures at one time . most E @-@ Mail accounts have limitations to the size of your e @-@ mail . it is perhaps a good idea to send multiple mails , if you want to send a lot of pictures . &quot;
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the pictures . your configuration is saved and every@@ time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . in case you choose Thunder@@ bird , you must specify in the input field below the correct path for your installation . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail@@ agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after the selection of comments in a attached file , the comments to the pictures are put together into a text file and the mail is attached . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the menu pictures file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files such as T@@ IF@@ F . you therefore should use P@@ NG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend you the JP@@ EG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JP@@ EG under pictures of file format and are the original files in JP@@ EG format , then the original expression data will be added to the pictures . &quot;
&quot; when the process is ready , the window will not automatically closed the status of status , looking for errors . your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . with the kno@@ b , you can kno@@ ck this window . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module advanced , sli@@ deshow is out of window with questions like you like your sli@@ deshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option API transi@@ tions in the presentation activate very elegant images via OpenGL . however , you do not have to possess a relevant graphics card , as otherwise the sli@@ deshow is very slow . &quot;
the option fil@@ en@@ ames displays that the fil@@ en@@ ame of images in the lower left corner during the presentation will be shown .
the option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop . you can then manually ab@@ ort by Es@@ c .
the option is by chance to select that the pictures are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of images in the album .
&quot; in delay between the images , the temporary distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . so you should be sure of presenting your friends presenting your friends ! &quot;
there are over a dozen transi@@ tions between which you can select . random@@ ly choose among each passage between the pictures a different effect .
&quot; during the sli@@ deshow you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen , move the mouse in this corner to turn it on . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next image and stop the sli@@ deshow . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ames , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; currently , the K@@ IP@@ I module is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org. &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Back@@ picture is a tool to put an image as a background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module keeps the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your KDE working surface . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with comments , you can see with a photo album ; see picture . as you can see by comparison with the picture , then in people , places and in the group keywords messages . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you look at your pictures and videos with comments . additionally there are entries to look at your hard drive , and of course viewing the actual records . in the following , each one is described . &quot;
&quot; if you press with the mouse on the entry persons , the view of the browser changes . &quot;
if you select a further person only the pictures are shown on which both individuals are to be seen . through this sel@@ ections , you can restrict the number of images shown by a few thousand pictures on a few single pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view photos to view the pictures of your own field . &quot;
&quot; in the picture every person has the same symbol before their name . you can save with a photo album ; however , for each person you can see your own image , this also applies to places , keywords , and other categories that you have defined yourself . see also the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the name , select the button , which is on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view for each category separately . you have the advantage that you can display e.g. symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you do not have appropriate images ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you must define which picture for each individual person is to be displayed . now you can select an image editor , as shown in the picture . you can select the image for the appropriate person . in the note window you can adjust the image for the appropriate person . in the note window you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor to your wishes and thus select which part of the picture is to be shown or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you visit the main window in the main window , you will see a dialog , which is very similar to the dialog for the fix@@ ing of the image properties . this dialog will look at the picture even more . &quot;
&quot; if you want to enter a text box or description , the co@@ atings or descriptions of the images will be searched for . if you want , you can also select a date that is required , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the bottom part of the window you can browse all pictures of the same name as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , however , are not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for a photo album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manu@@ als , but rather like to try hand@@ books , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and look at the quick@@ set , the screens@@ hot and the introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialog the demo , in case you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu Help menu for the first time . consequently , some example pictures are loaded and you can test the features of &quot; &quot; photo album &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a continuous HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the Tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar you see here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you data @-@ statistics about the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the time bar can show you several different time units . each bar shows another unit . you can change between the units of months , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you see a part of a database by showing the glue only 10 minutes sections . &quot;
&quot; the time bar can be used on the following ways : you can preview the displayed entries view from the database ( if you select a date , the current image will always shown the current date in the preview display ) and then the tim@@ eline is always shown the current date of the currently shown pictures when you preview in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of time bar by clicking the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the time line , so when you choose a range , you will be shown in the preview view only pictures of this period . you can choose the selection by clicking on a beam of the time bar . &quot;
&quot; photo album ; provides you with two options available to create HTML websites with your pictures , integrated into a photo album ; the one is available in a photo album ; see in the following part of the user manual ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual ( see ) integrated version , which you can create via the HTML ... &quot;
&quot; before the HTML page , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and goal . in the following , each section is described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first enter the title of the survi@@ vor@@ s and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on the photo@@ version ; HTML example pages , you will see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , choose whether a free photo album ; -@@ export file should be created , that is to be seen on the review page . more information about the export files can be found in . &quot;
&quot; most recently , you can choose which information is displayed on the HTML sites . therefore , you can avoid that information is displayed on the viewer also without description . for example , that all pictures are exported from a party . for example , all pictures are exported . therefore , you can not use this setting to hide certain images before certain considerations . &quot;
&quot; in this area you can define how the HTML page needs to look like . most settings options are clear , which is why it is not designed specifically for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can view various resolutions to the pictures . thereby , those who have to look at your website and have a monitor that the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 will have no images to download for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have fixed . so he can browse your pictures with low resolution that leads to a lower transmission time . if he wants to see an image larger it changes to a higher resolution .
&quot; in this setup area , you specify the different folder and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; the best option is to select a base folder for all your HTML files , and for each subsequent phrase a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first , you must select the main folder in which all your pictures will be saved . this folder is saved and selecting them on the next time . you can choose either a folder or one of KDE sponsor protocol for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can verify whether this really all are visible for viewers . if you have created for the base folder a URL , the URL you specify , should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the files created by you , you have to manually copy them into the final target folder . thus , you need to copy it manually . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders . &quot;
&quot; the above settings options described are all three on ground@@ ed folder and URLs . in these , a sub @-@ folder is assigned , whose name you specify in output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of a photo album ; you might want to add a HTML page to viewing the pictures . however , if you already have a lot of time for viewing the pictures , reception , etc . , you must do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not even do . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; cot album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import and import it into your database . the image features are ex@@ iled and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in that the images themselves are stored with inside the file or if the file is just a short@@ cut to pictures . the advantage of all images entered into the file and that you can share it independently . the obvious draw@@ back is however the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can export a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file ... or together with HTML files , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file with a HTML file , this becomes an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file seeks the images in a double way . first , it searches the images that are specified in the folder of .@@ k@@ im file . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML files . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for the export of pictures described you can export over the menu file ... &quot;
&quot; the most important option of this dialogue is whether to act in internal or external .@@ k@@ im files , the following three choices are available : &quot;
&quot; in the manual , copy the .@@ k@@ im file you need to copy the pictures to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the option Autom@@ atic near the .@@ k@@ im file copied &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the pictures are automatically recommended for you . &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . because most images have already been com@@ pressed with JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worthwhile to squee@@ ze the files . if you still want to choose this one simply select the option export file .
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum size size . if you want to send your friends pictures , you might not want to put the pictures in full size , since the .@@ k@@ im file is otherwise very large . here you can limit the size by example , for example , that each image is a maximum of 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File Im@@ ports ... select , becomes a photo album ; the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the wiz@@ ard to import imports consists of four steps . first , you have to select which pictures you want to import it , in which folder the import will be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category persons of the resulting file , while this category is called by your database persons . therefore , you are asked in the third Colum@@ ns window , which categories to import / imported file and which categories them in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can pick up the categories of the resulting file with the categories of your current database . one example here is on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it has to be easy to browse and see pictures : if you look at pictures , you &apos;d like to look inside different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you look at the example pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you may want to see all the pictures in which this friend is pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find the various steps of ( 1 ) det@@ aching the information about your pictures , about ( 2 ) finding and pres@@ tige , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and adapt@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for the pamper@@ ing of your pictures . but it has been extended and today , it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this hand@@ book is spoken about pictures , but frequently this also includes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; photo album ; saves all of its information in the C@@ index@@ .x@@ ml file in the top folder of their pictures . these are a simple XML file , which you can secure with a program of your choice , e.g. normal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in the CV@@ S where they want . &quot;
&quot; photo album ; notice the folder in which your pictures are stored and uses this for future Star@@ ts automatically . if you want to start another database in a photo album , then you can start another folder , with the option -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / index@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; through the menu entry Settings menu , set up into a window , with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will explain the different settings options . &quot;
&quot; on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can view the settings of the Pre@@ view and the options for the viewer . for any setting , you can access the F1 button and click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; in this you describe how you can set different properties for each image , for example people , locations and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; on view you see the dialog , which is used to already edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories are already mentioned . in dialogue options , you can set up complete members , i.e. , e.g. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of all groups of a one @-@ gli@@ eds as explained . &quot;
&quot; in view , you see the setting options available to you on the fix@@ ing of the members , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left of the window , you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of the sub@@ categories . &quot;
&quot; photo album ; shares his modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ ti@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface . more information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be called over the menu modules . the modules can be used and are not described in this manual , because they are not part of a photo album ; but most modules have a help page , which you can call over the modules itself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules can be used together with multiple applications to each other , it may be that the module with &amp; k@@ photo@@ genic album ; for this reason , you should always test your own pictures with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album / demo version \ &gt; or via the menu Help . don &apos;t tell you , I could not have warned ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , thus making it be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; photo album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications do not support their pictures in albums : there &apos;s an album just a folder . even though &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , simul@@ ated it for some modules to use the functions with a photo album . &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which corresponds to the current view , so all the pictures that show you the picture show at the moment . &quot;
&quot; besides the current album has to be released , photo album ; the modules also contains a list of albums . here is a photo album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then every entry of this category presents a record for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category that you have specified in the introduc@@ tory dialog as a category for virtual albums , so if you choose for example the category people , it &apos;s going to do , so if you choose persons to view and pass the module this . &quot;
&quot; because some modules with a photo album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and choose the modules that you need to load . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see an example for a start@@ screen , as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by each other KDE application , take a look at the window above . at the moment it does not contain a lot of information , as you do not find any information about your pictures . in the section you will not find out more information about your images . in the section we will display all the images , which shows you an overview with all existing pictures . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of a photo album ; is the possibility to see each picture with notes , including the image is taken on the picture , etc . you can put each image either individually or for a larger number of images made certain notes at the same time . if for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per pic@@ tured and all pictures in Copenhagen have been recorded . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; see three lists with a text box by choosing persons , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use it again if you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is the moving of images within the list . if you have for example a family party , and on all 50 paintings are the same 5 @-@ 10 persons you can , so that the used names can be moved up , the people can find faster and assign . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tical list , click on the icon for sor@@ ting on date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected comments on each picture separately , you may wish to edit all the selected images and add this pictures with note . in this case simply click the above and back buttons , which are on the right at the top of the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have several images , e.g. using the same person , then it can be more comfortable to mark all these pictures and use the menu item multiple entries at a time with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . besides , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; in the picture you see a browser window of the USA as the super@@ group shows . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special symbol is shown . &quot;
&quot; in context of context of context , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also add an entry to a category and place it in order to sort this to a sub@@ category of this entry . respect , this requires that you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically . see it . &quot;
&quot; you can move the single elements of the fence by drawing up the bar that form the upper edge of the frame , anch@@ oring and move . you can also make a window of your own window by drawing him outside of the window . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs , click on the button options ... , which offers you the opportunity to store up the current construction and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also leave a frame completely out of the window . if you want to see this window later , use the button Options ... and here window a / bl@@ ending . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; select the images displayed in the browser , you get an overview with imag@@ inary pictures of the currently selected images , or of all pictures in case you have no filters . one example here . you can configure the size of the mouse @-@ looking pictures , by simply clicking the mouse button with the middle mouse button . just try it . &quot;
&quot; when you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on an image , it is displayed in the picture tab . if you have not yet opened a window with a picture look , a new display committee will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete pictures from which you wish to delete or delete the Del@@ ete button , or select either the Del@@ ete button or select in the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; photo album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use a solution with a photo album . of course , you can also use the images stored anywhere , so that &amp; photo album ; you see in the database index . in the picture you see the view of a photo album ; if not all necessary images can be loaded from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; pictures , where the upper upper corner is cut off , are not saved on the hard drive . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the pres@@ sions are present , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the preview of these images . however , you can also view these pictures with the image view . &quot;
&quot; as you see , this function takes you to copy files from the folders and re @-@ copy it . for example , you do not need to avoid the inser@@ tion of the concerned CD . if you want to avoid taking the one another one , please buy a bigger hard disk in order to save all the images . &quot;
&quot; in the menu pictures you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little bit more privacy , filter the images so that you want to in@@ accessible for others and click Out@@ look@@ out View . alternatively , you can also see all pictures that your little sister may see , cont@@ agi@@ ers and the menu entry . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you set out what pictures in the case of the case should be hidden . if you pass the laptop with your little sister , simply select the menu item , then click re @-@ blin@@ ded . if you want to see the pictures again , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password that must be entered to the un@@ lock of the pictures . to set up this password , simply select password in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; remember that this picture protection is not very safe . for one , all pictures on the hard disk and the other can anyone who can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection serves only to those who are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to appreciate the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you can manage all your pictures with a photo album ; manage and hours over hours with it is natural that you want to see them at some point . for this reason , it has a picture _ and video concerned . these can be seen from the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer you can see in . he shows of course the picture , but additional all the information you have about the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ Box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can easily pull it with the mouse and specify exactly what information is displayed and whether information is displayed . all of these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . the following constell@@ ation menu can be seen below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ Box are underlined . if you click here is the browser , see the suitable entries to this display . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them and go back by using the buttons image high and image . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also available from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as a sli@@ deshow . as often it loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image by pressing the str@@ g button and plus or minus . started and stopped the sli@@ deshow with the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S . &quot;
a very useful skill of the beh@@ older of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer is using the entire room on screen . simply use the entry button to switch in full screen mode and back .
if you use the observer in the image and pull out zo@@ oming . to the point you can easily get a rect@@ angle . with the minus button you can get back r@@ aus@@ zo@@ oming the plus @-@ button zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the picture . shows how a z@@ oom @-@ rect@@ angle indicates and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
&quot; with the point button you can reset your z@@ oom so that the image is not zo@@ omed in zo@@ om@@ t . with the simultaneous Option sets the zo@@ oms , so that every pi@@ xel matches the screen of a pi@@ xel of the picture . &quot;
&quot; note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work with videos , that in and can be zo@@ oming with the plus and the same key . &quot;
with the turn@@ around menu you can rot@@ ate the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu .
&quot; if you look at pictures it may happen if you find a picture with a person whose names you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can see the view off and typ@@ ing configur@@ ations@@ dialog of the picture , but you might just prefer to highlight the image and view more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images on a printer in order to see the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and watch them as good or bad as you see one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer will give you the possibility to look pictures with features while you see them . characteristics are the characters A to Z and you can put a feature by pressing the corresponding letters . in see a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set out features on your pictures , these are available in the browser . so , you can see all the images that you want to edit , print or whatever you have selected , so just add all pictures to one CD once more , or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can display in the preview view , then you can display features to the pictures , simply by pressing the letter for the picture when the picture was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on the picture to paint .
&quot; the painting is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can be revers@@ ed your pocket later . &quot;
in you can see an image at the painting . to turn the Mal@@ mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; turn on the painting out of the context menu . to finish the painting in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; to work , you must master the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not completely master but the documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the building tree , you can select single objects . then their properties are shown in the properties tab and the object in the wire model views yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple properties simultaneously . but not the sub@@ object of one already selected object , as all sub@@ objects already are selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position on which you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry into the menu . &quot;
&quot; there are several possible positions , the following pop@@ up menu is built @-@ in , so that you can choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with Del@@ ete from the menu bar , below Edit or from the context menu of the right button , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click apply to take these changes . you have entered invali@@ d values and then click on to apply the input file or apply changes to ab@@ ort . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the path to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user &apos;s documentation in the furnishings , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L @-@ Users documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download them here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains already the user &apos;s documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can view a preview in your own view view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is selected with the selected texture . as default , all texture is checked . as default , all texture is checked ( for example a texture inside a texture Map and not the whole texture Map ) , you cross local level . &quot;
&quot; the screens@@ hot shows the points of the camera . you can drag this check@@ points with the mouse button , and thereby change the position and direction of camera . &quot;
&quot; if a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points and it will display a small cross in the wire view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifting . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
every object has a wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the visibility of the super@@ ordinate object or as absolute value . objects are only then displayed when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal in the tool@@ bar selected .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window form as default . the object tree and the view of the properties tab are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the standard window size , or if you need a different order , you can adjust them as you can . you can also save multiple window options and easily switch between different regulations . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or under any view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view and extends to the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to arrange several views over one another , drag the starter middle to another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the cardboard box at the top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window frames are so@@ othing views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view of the anch@@ oring , drag the starter to the desktop or click on the small to the left upper arrow at the landing bar . &quot;
&quot; to view a view , click on the small cross in the landing bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrows and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views in the main window . in the menu View , you can find entries for any kind of views . new views are sc@@ ant , you can anchor them to any point . &quot;
the current window view can be saved with window frames ... save it . there will be a dialog in which you can save the window form under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 not supported . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ dering the icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu button . &quot;
&quot; an R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . he determines the image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want a scene in different sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full@@ ness in the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar , or in the menu View R@@ ender modes ... select , the following dialogue will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can type any name , but it is a name that can detect the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the card pack size , you can insert the width and height of the ender@@ image . if you want to ren@@ dering a small area of the picture , select the cross section sub@@ section and enter the picture @-@ section to ren@@ dering the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination field quality , you can select the characteristics which uses &amp; Pov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering it . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user refl@@ ections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user &apos;s manual for a Pov@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; if an image with only one beam je pixels is calculated , there can be different errors . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or mixing effects in cur@@ ves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pi@@ xel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called Anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of these errors . generally speaking pictures with this feature is better .
&quot; when you turn Anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculated and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than one beam the pixels . this technique is being super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive not @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because every pi@@ xel is adapted again and adap@@ tive because every pi@@ xel is more and more adap@@ tive because each pi@@ xel depends on the calculated colour values .
&quot; when you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray faces a beam up pi@@ xel . if the difference between colour values exce@@ eds the adjacent threshold , then a grid of 4x@@ 4 additional points will be calculated , with a lowering of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays each pi@@ xel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pi@@ xel is calculated : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pi@@ xel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pi@@ xel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pi@@ xel . if the difference between colour values exce@@ eds the predomin@@ ance threshold , then the pixels is split into 4 sub@@ pi@@ xel that can be continued individually and set to further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can adjust you with the lowering . &quot;
&quot; another opportunity to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the production of cra@@ yon for the beam process , called J@@ atter@@ ing . when you turn to J@@ itter , changes &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use lights are charged . it takes a very long time to charge a scene with this feature . &quot;
&quot; on this map , you can set if the Alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pi@@ xel is then transparent when the associated str@@ aps have no object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for viewing the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; Con@@ sol@@ der @-@ over@@ s . if &amp; Pov@@ ray is finished , you can find the reason for it here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ Sc@@ ene , select the menu item import ... and select a file in dialogue window . &quot;
currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; still not the full command from &amp; Pov@@ ray ; if in the im@@ por@@ ting error messages or war@@ nings appear , a dialogue window will display a list of all the messages . &quot;
if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source text between the two particular comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ End .
&quot; you can export objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; this adds to the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor , just highlight the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot;
with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can also insert source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; likewise .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene . usually this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
&quot; when you click on help in the original view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user &apos;s documentation on the shown object . put the path to your documentation and the version . support the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example , al@@ location data ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files which are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . when a file is used in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire model . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the check@@ points . the second color will be used for viewing the check@@ points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the lens of the camera view and in the window type labels .
&quot; you can set the object @-@ hau@@ l of points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifting , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values perform a more precise , model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the level of detail in two directions . &quot;
if you cross High Detailed views for extended proj@@ ections while the camera uses an extended projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and the sen@@ k@@ right proj@@ ections . this characteristic features a better approach for proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering . &quot;
&quot; if you want to show wall , a wall is separated behind the objects . the wall is represented in a ch@@ ecker @-@ board pattern from two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you show ground cross , a ground below the objects is broken . the soil is displayed in a ch@@ ecker @-@ board pattern from two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you tick cant@@ at@@ tung , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for ren@@ dering of the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can set it . more accurate information about the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window structures or create new window @-@ orders . in section window arrangements will be explained how to create window structures and save it . &quot;
the default box standard window display : displays all existing window shapes . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used the chosen window form when starting the program .
the list available window options displays all existing window shapes . a new arrangement lets you create with the button add and a selected arrangement with the button Del@@ ete .
every window of window will be identified by the name . the name must be clear and cannot be empty .
the list below the name displays all views of the selection assignment . new views can be set up with the button add and selected views with the button Del@@ ete .
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column , create a new column on the right side of the available window , with the window anchor in the window under the existing window , with card window , you get a cardboard box together with the previous view and so@@ othing the view not in the main window , but generates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just installed &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you would like to follow any more exact knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere at a level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings , before you complain that you as a result just got a black screen . if you use a 3D program , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you set no camera , no rules for ren@@ dering can be applied as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; when you insert no light sources , your whole scene lies in the dark and you only get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have got everything error @-@ free , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; following pres@@ enter elements : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get acquainted with the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation so you can expect an appropriate idea of what you can expect from that program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; model &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to remove this manual , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item processing . thus you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the wire model top shows how the camera views the whole scene that you generate . in particular , you notice the scene from the view of the camera . this is the result of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view properties tab in which the different parameters can be found . in the user &apos;s documentation to a Pov@@ ray ; find out more details . &quot;
&quot; change nothing at the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved later instructions , but note that the camera in view controls can change . just click with the left mouse button on a check@@ point and draw it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when you apply the button or the input field , the wire @-@ model views and the lens will immediately change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could insert for example a wh@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body wh@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an understanding approach to solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simple way . you can use an infinite layer as ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the button . in the object of the object , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model clearly shows the level , even at the moment only as a limited level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the plane extends as far as the horizon . &quot;
&quot; when you look at the Object tree , you will notice that you click on the symbol + before the object . you see then the different parameters for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the properties tab . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the floor to exercise an unit under the horiz@@ ont@@ line , just to get some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; only choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple in the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog will open in which you can select how the object is inserted . please select the name in the original view ( name = floor pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview , see how the pig@@ ment now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the Pre@@ viewing of the pig@@ ments only includes a Matt@@ es containing material because you can still examine the appearance of material at any time with a click on preview . do you now give the colors for the pig@@ ment . also , there are many possibilities but you now take the easiest way . &quot;
&quot; if you do not preview any color on Qu@@ ader and ball , just click on the button and then preview the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is right now . if you are using your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
of course this is not the color you have expected . here are further settings necessary . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this even more frequently but the Chess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
&quot; select in the object @-@ tree jed@@ es@@ mal einf@@ o , and change the colors in the view of the properties tab : &quot;
this step should you already be able to run out because you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should have understood the ball as simple as the floor :
&quot; in the view of the properties tab , you can instantly change the settings : on 1 ( do not forget the input field or the button ) , so the sphere of exposure to the ground . otherwise , the bul@@ let on the ground swing back , since you have moved the bottom to one unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , the ren@@ dering now follows a strange result : as before you see , the ball surface like a Matt@@ es made material . put in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material . as already at the floor , enter the sphere a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; choose the first and change the name for example , in the sphere of pig@@ ment . click the ball of Pig@@ ment , select then einf@@ o and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; however , you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish features : &quot;
then change the values as in the following screens@@ hot and click on apply or press En@@ ter .
&quot; the settings of shine @-@ effect and reflection are already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or ch@@ rom@@ atic surfaces , even if metal : still not selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you have &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully , you have already learned so much that you can easily create , but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tr@@ ay@@ cing is an R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ts a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en , the ren@@ dering hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the spect@@ ator ( i.e. from the camera resulting in the scene ) by every Pixel in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog . thus , the scene pixels are processed for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will not see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source you see also nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene that is to be checked , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;

&quot; a B@@ ump map is a way to exchange smo@@ other surfaces , without having to model@@ ed on the surface separately and without changing the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself . &quot;
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for a B@@ ump map as well as for a texture Map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as components : very complex 3D models are generated from do@@ zens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then edited afterwards to give them a realistic appearance .
&quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on the pi@@ xel basis , by using a file @-@ file as a color card . &quot;
&quot; this application is a comfortable sofa @-@ friendly and browser browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can select pictures to display . &quot;
images can be displayed in either separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
&quot; the use of a cordless show ; is very simple . the file &apos;s browser lists files , which you can show with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the button Return . &quot;
&quot; you can set if any picture is to be displayed in an own window , or whether all images are always used in the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for a specific file , simply type the first sign of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small entry field is found in the lower right corner . if a suitable fil@@ en@@ ame was found , the file is highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing any return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;

&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an easy application for sc@@ ans of images that don &apos;t make more than images to scan and retri@@ eve the images instantly in a specified folder containing automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the images before storage .
you can review the status of the support of your scanner on the SAN@@ E project by entering the necessary information on this search page : http : / / www.s@@ ane @-@ project@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified then a dialog to choose the scanner is opened .
&quot; the user can select the scanner , and push OK to open the scanner . ab@@ ort is termin@@ ated &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite . &quot;
the other settings contain more det@@ a@@ illed options of the drivers . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options .
&quot; to deposit a picture , the user can only start a pr@@ elo@@ ad and then scan the scan for the final scan . the preview can be launched by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to select the image better , the user can enter the image and out of the current range zo@@ oming . he can also set the z@@ oom so that the complete preview fits into the window . &quot;
when the picture was chosen then the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; if before stor@@ ing a preview display in the settings selected , then the image is displayed in a window of window , as shown below is displayed . if saving pressed , then the image will be saved and sl@@ ey ? en leads to a quar@@ ry and you will get back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the button settings , the ep@@ onymous dialog will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case the option before saving a preview must be displayed . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be chosen . &quot;
this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images can select . dialog for saving each photo opens the dialog in front of each suspended image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; it is automatically saved with a generated name in a previously defined folder : then you must save to ask for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
&quot; this option defines where the pictures can be stored on the option may be saved without a fil@@ en@@ ames , then this folder is used as standard for dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a photo fix for the automatically to be mem@@ ori@@ zed images and , moreover , the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically stored image gets a numer@@ ical su@@ ff@@ ix of every time when a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can custom@@ ize the image quality . this value also changes the com@@ pression mode by saving . if you do not choose the image quality , then the default value is used by Q@@ t . &quot;

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other programs short@@ cuts . below you can set up a list of this short@@ cuts and set their function . choose the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ specific key@@ boards you can set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and choose short commands .
&quot; you may establish any available multimedia buttons , so that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ short rest function . this way you can make your keyboard to &amp; amar@@ ok ; -@@ Control Center . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which are mostly also available in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context @-@ browser , playlist , playlist , playlist , and example : that look like : &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command &apos;s command options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de . additionally , Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ lines options . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script can be run on account of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script whether all necessary modules are available and take advantage of this dialog , so that the user ID is not running . &quot;

&quot; in the folder Scrip@@ ts / Make a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a base for your own scripts , or simply custom@@ ize the necessary functions . you will quickly find that writing from scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , you can exchange scripts with amar@@ ok and manage las@@ ok . the simpl@@ est way is using the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be attached to each KDE installation . &quot;
&quot; most scripts , enable the exec@@ uting of external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p can be called extern@@ ally ( ) function . in this way d@@ co@@ p can be called relatively easily . here an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends messages to all current script . for this reason , strings on the default script should monitor and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can even ignore the events unless you use it . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to indicate the furnis@@ hing dialog . to save the stor@@ ing and loading of the furnishings , each script must take care of each script . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the work@@ sheet to the folder , where all data is stored . &quot;
&quot; tr@@ ack@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is all@@ u@@ ded . the script could now ask for example ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions for more information about the new piece ( for example , the met@@ ad@@ ata or the pressur@@ ized length ) . &quot;
vol@@ um@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume sign@@ alized a change of volume . the new volume is a int@@ eger between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ize men@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu item@@ id Tit@@ le you can also use the path to the selected files of the playlist if a user @-@ defined menu item can also use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ OK script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu item@@ id ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ated , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be handled to work for example , for example , stor@@ ing data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ oks script management can also install script packages that has been downloaded the user &amp; eg ; from a web@@ server has been downloaded - such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ archives ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) which can also be detected with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) . we recommend a Archi@@ ve@@ s.@@ amar@@ ok@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 so that the user can clearly identify the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the Ex@@ am script script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right away . &quot;
the main object must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) that should not be exec@@ utable ( + x ) that should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter to obtain the file &apos;s right :
&quot; when your script package is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and link the link to the Wik@@ i script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; link to your listing at k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ OK ; script . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; e. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply pull music into the playlist , instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you are looking for a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collecting @-@ time browser and the quick@@ set you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide what you want to hear ? then , the playlist settings still falls , select the dynamic mode and the intelligent play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to specific criteria . &quot;
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . moreover , many different audio systems can be used for you to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to re@@ discover your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually , one has to enter the base folder from Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ aca , you should compile no trouble . if you encounter any problems , please report these to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has like most applications some options , which you enable or dis@@ able to activate the configure script with the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iler options , certain dependen@@ cies need to be met , so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bug@@ ging icons . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you would like to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty over the furnis@@ hing dialog . the furnis@@ hing dialog has multiple kart@@ ing cards to arrange the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
&quot; player window displays the player window in addition to the playlist one or off . if the option is switched off , only the playlist window will be found . &quot;
&quot; mood bar@@ ometer use : this function is only available , if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ oo@@ lo@@ aders has been compiled . the option spl@@ its the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer . &quot;
atmospheric design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ oo@@ lo@@ ve@@ able has been compiled . this makes the use of color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer .
&quot; editing text files on the music files : this function is only available , if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ oo@@ lo@@ ve@@ . if this setting is enabled , the .@@ bit files are stored in the settings of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ bit files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / m@@ oo@@ able / ) . &quot;
&quot; external browser : lets you choose which browser runs from &amp; Amar@@ ok , when a browser is needed . &quot;
use other browser : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list .
&quot; playlist upon store , save the current playlist automatically at the end of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; turn this option if you want to lose the current playlist upon finishing . &quot;
&quot; relative paths to manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this attitude , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the memory location of the playlist , otherwise use the absolute position of the music @-@ files . &quot;
&quot; current piece of piece of pieces are visible , indicating that the play@@ lists of the play@@ lists are up / roll @-@ up to keep the current piece always in the visible window . &quot;
&quot; when changes to the context @-@ browser change automatically changes the context @-@ browser , as soon as the next track is being picked up . &quot;
in the section called look &amp; amar@@ ok ; s appearance can be adjusted . the section is divided into three parts .
&quot; in the fonts section you can use the use of different writings in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can use fonts for the following area : playlist windows , player @-@ windows and context @-@ browser . press ... , so you can choose a font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of customised colour scheme , you own the tor@@ al of choice and you can set up your own color scheme . use the among them the activated color selection for front and background colour . &quot;
&quot; playing on the start contributed , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start playing back automatically with the piece on the spot , with which they stopped during the last stop . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is recommended , a preview of the O@@ SD display will display and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
&quot; the first option is the font . click on select ... to select from the dialog the desired scri@@ be for the O@@ SD , which displays the text in the O@@ SD . &quot;
&quot; use of your own color gives you the opportunity to custom@@ ize the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . a click on the color areas open the dialog to color selection . if owner colours do not use activated , the pre @-@ made &amp; k@@ de colors are used . &quot;
the input field display text presents the text in the O@@ SD text . by entering spac@@ ing space the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your needs . below is a list of available space holder and what they mean .
the option screen is intended for X@@ om@@ ama user . this allows you to define what screen should appear with the O@@ SD screen on screen .
the card card audio version lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ box . some drivers another set of settings in this card card .
the card pack collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . that includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , select &amp; amar@@ ok ; as well as search for a folder in the collection , select the cross box next to its name . this section also contains an@@ cruci@@ fied fields to cover , as with the chosen folder procedure . &quot;
sub@@ directories are different : this causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders to search for music .
&quot; changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files added or deleted ) . moreover , an incre@@ mental search is done to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
&quot; playlist methods : results that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists are added to your collection ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection , then automatically added to the play@@ lists . &quot;
the part collection database is used to choose a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected is still necessary further establishment in the My@@ S@@ ql establishment .
&quot; the My@@ S@@ ql facility will be used for setting the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok . after calcul@@ ator the computer will enter , on which the My@@ S@@ ql databases is inserted , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name that is manufactured . &quot;
use user name : and password : for input data you need to connect to the database .
the card @-@ load pul@@ .@@ f@@ m sets the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m a . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can provide the names of played mos@@ quit@@ oes to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m @-@ server and create music recommendations for the current piece .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your loaded .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
&quot; send pieces and update such a profile : this setting allows it &amp; amar@@ ok ; to forward the names of the played pieces to your loaded .@@ f@@ m profile . &quot;
&quot; similar interpre@@ ters call : after activ@@ ating this attitude becomes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to the respectively played piece . note : you may not need to use the list in context @-@ browser . note : you do not need to use the free .@@ f@@ m profile to be able to use this function . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; eg ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of the functions and gallery with screen@@ caps .
Amar@@ ok requires only the package C@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other KDE packages . you need to have K@@ deli@@ bs therefore installed ( including the programs included in it ) for example . we have written a small instructions on how to re@@ compile K@@ deli@@ bs .
&quot; some features such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ oses that your window manager will hold the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . so , flu@@ x@@ box will help for example , we use Cas@@ ok on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these represent an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; most likely , one of your files will make an error in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can see the file cap@@ turing in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . afterwards , you can delete the file and let the collection again . &quot;
mostly it is because Tag@@ lib cr@@ ashes with reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file . please report these errors to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is something more mature . &quot;
&quot; ensure that all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version were compiled . if , for example &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , then this leads to overthrow the met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you are using KDE with art@@ s@@ d , then dis@@ able v@@ ending machines , if in@@ active for ... in the adjustment of the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) . if it is a common crash , and you can send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many program information write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in the Met@@ a @-@ Info , but this does not mark as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / perl the &quot; The file $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ f@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ E &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; s &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / re@@ petition / Dynam@@ ics playlist ) see in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbols used in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can click the status de@@ activated on grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases , you must click on a symbol for three times , until this setting will show its effect . &quot;
if you get this bug : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ matched symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ s@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map . then please check if Amar@@ ok has the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ N@@ amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this bug , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ating Q@@ t version or edit / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ o@@ ok will first find the right version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation problems clarify the easiest way by using a experts your Uni@@ xes or Linux distribution . you can also find help with other users or with developers . they can also use the Forum and IR@@ C at ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only one mistake if something about a bug in Amar@@ ok itself is up .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist will appear . how do the music pieces come in ?
this is easy . use the navig@@ ator on the left and open the folder folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start window into the Statisti@@ cs window was converted . you find it under extras statistics . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 and Fast For@@ ward : stars are for the evaluation by the user , while the points will be automatically calculated . &quot;
&quot; to evaluate pieces must be displayed in the playlist . click on the Tit@@ le list of the playlist , and select column evaluation . click anywhere in the new review column to use the rating for a piece . you can also use the short commands of Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works , when Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press Ent@@ f on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your choice and then select the playlist from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let them drop there , just like you would do it with other files too . so simple is that : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , just next to the add @-@ button , the button has to store playlist . click on it . &quot;
presum@@ ably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the package x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; amar@@ ok ; new . look even after lib@@ visual , this package contains a lot of very beautiful visu@@ alis@@ ations . &quot;
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition you can find it via the menu bar under extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; not . yes , that really is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used one from the back@@ end independent base , therefore the actual issue will be the world media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ins / eng / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ D ? . as you see , we can even support text and P@@ NG . &quot;
&quot; it may ! perhaps use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which can be delivered in default no MP3 @-@ de@@ or ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , En@@ ter &quot;
start the Ya@@ a@@ Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Play MP3 &apos;s off : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with AL@@ SA S@@ ink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA ( software mix@@ er ) . check out the support for AL@@ SA . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you find the problem of trouble and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ oms ) . &quot;
&quot; this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media is first de@@ coded . G@@ Stre@@ amer is not easy for most people , you &apos;d just read a white smoke . g@@ Stre@@ amer will read the file , de@@ coded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS bo@@ des the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can spend directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ins . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable Sound@@ server with highest priority ( real time ) and increase the size of the sound buff@@ ers ( warning ! see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ ap@@ per su@@ id is set :
&quot; at KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ X , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia Co@@ dec@@ s that can cause play@@ back play@@ back . read this error report . the enlar@@ ging of the sound buff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA furniture file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ins , or install KDE multimedia complete to get the quicker Arts @-@ Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; probably you use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ins driver has been optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts bu@@ ffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the bu@@ ffer , the less applications react the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; amar@@ ok ; from why ? &quot;
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer you must register all components . run G@@ ST register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that does not help , you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
try this ( end Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download fi@@ m@@ peg to compile and install it . run then G@@ ST register with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST register again . start now &amp; amar@@ ok ;
please report them on bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org. you will have a full list of suggestions / wishes please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and find that the name sounds good . moreover the name is the magical ... : )
&quot; thanks D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . introduce in your calendar program an alarm and allow the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ player play &quot;
&quot; this command makes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you &apos;ll get from the gentle tones of music that you have stopped in front of bed . &quot;
how can we find the current title in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles will be experienced when you &apos;re on another computer ?
if a functioning ambient environment exists , you can proceed as follows . diesel instruction gives you interpre@@ ting and title of the current piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user @-@ user @-@ now@@ Pl@@ aying
replace IP @-@ address with your username and your username . this suggests that your identification is available in the file ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA .
&quot; the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ y ; -@@ window are separated from it on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size changing window . &quot;
the combination of Str@@ g + right mouse button is a piece in the pull @-@ order order in the queue . by pressing the input line after a search in the playlist will be the first search result and the search returned .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ ck@@ out functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the Control Bar ? &quot;
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browser is to be displayed .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS @-@ drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and appear on the console many error messages .

&quot; basically , this fits the previous assessment with a de@@ clin@@ ing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the rating for a piece by yourself , right click on a column title in the playlist window . then you can select the rating of a piece of pieces in just like all the other attributes , namely , using the right mouse button , click on the piece , edit or F2 . you can edit the rating in the dialog met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; the developers do not want to tell you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok , which means KDE packages have established a fixed release plan of the Plan of Amar@@ ok . &quot;

&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of l@@ int@@ els and therefore also causes a lot of error reports . &quot;
presum@@ ably the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ins or g@@ stre@@ amer . hence the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to configure &amp; amar@@ ok ; new configure and install .
&quot; now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules always do not appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; probably you use a distribution installed , installed the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary development files are missing . the same goes for x@@ ins , you need to install x@@ ins @-@ de@@ vel . afterwards , you need to compile and install again . &quot;
I get the mistake G@@ aff@@ amer Cri@@ tical * * : Factory for &apos;@@ ad@@ der &apos;s has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking . you have to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without delay . a tip of Merlin @-@ TC : used no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you will compile Amar@@ .
&quot; I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype au@@ dia / mp@@ 4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed . &quot;

&quot; the sub@@ window media player is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) , it must be integrated before the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod is involved , you will find the pieces on your iPod to performer inside the top list of the media player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces into your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and leave it on the list interpre@@ ters . if you &apos;re finished , the pieces are loaded onto your iPod . when the transmission is completed , stop &amp; amar@@ ok ; and rede@@ em the drive connection for your iPod . &quot;
&quot; using the tool@@ bar you can search a search area by which you can search for a file . search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all the files will be hidden . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the browser , there is a address bar , you can pick up music from a given URL . if you &apos;d like to enter music from a given URL , you can enter music in the file musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ gz and now you can drag the music from there into the playlist . &quot;
&quot; when the playlist is longer than in the window , the app@@ endi@@ x of files can be difficult . in the case the fet@@ al of the Shift key may be helpful : this will be inserted at the end of the list , and not at the corner . &quot;
&quot; the playlist releases all of you with the mouse at the desired location . you can enter the order by typ@@ ing the entries into the desired location . once you enter the letters , the letters are included . to reset the filter you hit the filter so long the set@@ back , until the text box is empty again . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for separate words , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; once entries are searching for entries , all search words , if you find for example one two three , the search will find all entries , one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; if you were searching between the search terms , one is searching for entries , either one or the other search term . examples : one OR two OR three . in this example , all the pieces are found , one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries , the spaces are included , then include the search box with ge@@ ff@@ is@@ ks : Mike Old@@ field . there@@ for entries are looked for entries , not to entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a particular search function , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . this is looking for pieces that have higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece , which does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something is looking for pieces , which is not included . &quot;
&quot; you can combine these syn@@ tax variations by one another . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 % comment : bad . this searches for all the pieces that have either included Mike classi@@ field , or have a higher rating as 50 and do not include the comment . &quot;
&quot; you can define the complete order of entries by clicking the str@@ g button , and then click with the right mouse button in the desired order to the entries . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be returned . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar of the playlist is at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . at the left you find the button &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; button . right next , you will find playlist , play@@ back empty and random@@ ly mixing . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons are hit back and restore recovery . this allows you to un@@ lock changes to the playlist or recover . &quot;

&quot; there are many more available buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example play@@ back and volume control . you can set the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and select the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information to the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the play@@ time of the current piece . moreover , the status for random mode and re @-@ pick can easily change by clicking with the mouse twice in the corresponding picture range . &quot;

&quot; played songs - this is the number of played pieces , which should be stored at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces were recently played . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces to be added after each played piece to the playlist . if you adjust more than 1 , the playlist will continuously grow , because only one piece is played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right have already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or intelligent play@@ lists . if you tick multiple Play@@ list , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; random pieces from any of the crossed play@@ lists . &quot;
some scripts allow your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click on setup .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; script install , install on script in which a script package will be installed . after you install the script , a new entry appears on the list . you can also install new script directly from the internet . use the kno@@ b other script . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to use a script longer , you can delete it . select it to un@@ load script from then on you un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please see in writing scripts . &quot;
&quot; the dialog window visu@@ alization @-@ plug is used to share the available visu@@ alis@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plugins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply enable the cross @-@ box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this quick@@ set should show you how you can create an audio CD in four steps , to be able to trace the steps you need to have a running installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b , and a folder of audio files . &quot;
&quot; this is a dialogue window , in which you can select which files you want to burn to CD . &quot;
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 or other relevant formats , then remember that you are re @-@ up to MP3 a bad quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate has been created . you can check if an audio CD was created by a random format . use the project au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect . &quot;

cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet such programs are generally referred to as Ripper .
&quot; O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is an entirely open , patented and professional technology for audio coding and for use with audio data streams . O@@ GG benefits from open source and is used in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Pre@@ bis Dec@@ o@@ der@@ - and En@@ coder modules . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ audio de@@ coder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( such as MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 @-@ Dec@@ oder module . &quot;
&quot; l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 de@@ coder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 @-@ en@@ coder module . &quot;
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for lost audio com@@ pression and de@@ com@@ pression . it is used by FLA@@ C de@@ coder module and the external audio @-@ en@@ coder module , so you can read FLA@@ C files and write FLA@@ C files . &quot;
&quot; Lib@@ sn@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Dec@@ oder : further libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible for example to de@@ code w@@ MA files to convert them to an audio CD . &quot;
&quot; SO@@ x : an aid program used between different audio formats , and convert . SO@@ x is used by the SO@@ x Audio En@@ coder module . &quot;
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for the video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : a full @-@ equipped car system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ sing video CDs and Super @-@ video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is useful for adapting the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful for example , for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different mounting level of different albums can lead to the un@@ good effect that the music pieces can be re@@ produced according to . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and can automatically re@@ install all videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a convenient approach to recently opened projects once again . the corresponding sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
&quot; saves the current project . if the project has been stored once , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it is asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ames . &quot;
saves the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . KDE &apos;s dialog Save under is displayed with which you can choose folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all required projects . this is the same as if you would save for each individual project file Save .
&quot; closes the current project . if a project has been modified and is not saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what has to happen . you can then also leave between saving and changes . besides , you can leave the closing and keep the project so open . &quot;
&quot; includes all open projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b , is asked for any non@@ stored project what has to happen , just as if you were called for each project file . &quot;
&quot; all closed projects and termin@@ ates &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . for each not stored project will be consul@@ ted what has to happen , as if you called the file . &quot;
&quot; if you access this entry , you can select the published dialog files for add to the project . it has the same effect as if you get the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; open the dialogue &quot; burning &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the behavior dialogue of the project . the only difference is the additional button Br@@ ing , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are explained about what is that ? -@@ help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry only appears in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful when you examine files for an Multi @-@ session CD . this is useful when you use files for an multi @-@ session CD . it is intended for you to be used rather than help so that you can already see the files and folder on the medium .
&quot; this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function promp@@ ted to remove files from the current project . this function remo@@ ves any files from the medium , it blin@@ ks just the previously imported files back . &quot;
&quot; opens the CD Cop@@ y dialog . this enables you to create a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only create an image of a CD which you can burn sometime later . besides , there is also the possibility of the cl@@ oning instead of normal cop@@ ier . you should cl@@ one if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; opens the DVD Cop@@ y dialog . this enables you to create a DVD on another medium . alternatively , you can also burn just an image of a DVD which will then burn sometime later . besides , the target medium can be large enough to start the whole ( video ) data from source medi@@ ums in the original form . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ R@@ W . thus , you can delete the whole content or parts of a CD @-@ R@@ W . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to form a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which makes the content fully deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing mod@@ i over@@ write and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; bur@@ ns a previously created CD image . the dialogue ask for a * .@@ iso , * .c@@ del@@ ity or * .@@ to@@ c -@@ file as a data source that is then immediately not supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ on * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , for this you must use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog ask for a * .@@ iso -@@ file as a data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
&quot; an earlier DVD movie can be converted . this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used as well . it contains information about the sophisticated video , codi@@ le settings and even ways to change the size and the cut black edges . &quot;
displays information about the available medium . this information is displayed in the content and contain properties of the medium such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bar of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is crossed , a small bar at the bottom of the window is displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; switches the folder view or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content is activated , their content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information , lock and un@@ locking of the disk or throwing the medium . &quot;
&quot; turns the ingredients to one or off . the ingredients allows to select and drag files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; turns the Cop@@ fl@@ ee in the project window one or off . the Cop@@ fl@@ ei@@ ste is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view open projects . the Cop@@ fl@@ ei@@ ste has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window for changing the buttons for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after having selected one of the commands available in the upper part , one can adjust the key@@ note to it further down . &quot;
&quot; this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; post office assistant . this allows the correct cre@@ denti@@ als to be adjusted for CDs and DVDs . for this , system managers will need to enter the password for the system manager ( root ) . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here general show@@ cases are to be done . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and the int@@ as@@ sion of the program .
&quot; is how many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ applications equipped with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality may be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can either use the command line D@@ co@@ p , or that is just the more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , which is more likely to represent your taste and the nature of your requirements . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; to make use of it , you must make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; start . then enter something like the following at the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions , all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program realized , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other pieces , which are described below . &quot;
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; features functions like copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for the creation of new projects . &quot;

&quot; as a result of such an creat@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you can create a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ ref ( K@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atives and then get a reference to the project by # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which can only be applied to data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :

&quot; audio CD , audio CD ; -@@ read@@ ers for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ read@@ able for &amp; k@@ de ; and with it you can easily be saved audio CD ; s can be read and installed in MP@@ 3- , or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on En@@ coder which is installed on the machine . &quot;
&amp; C@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading of &amp; CD ; -@@ data in W@@ AV files on the hard disk ) and by many Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers who are supported these W@@ AV files ( com@@ pressed com@@ pression ) . further co@@ er@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they were installed ) .
&quot; first , the titles of the CD was read , read and saved in W@@ AV files on the computer ( left @-@ free and com@@ pressed ) ; and then &quot;
become a second step these W@@ AV files ( usually one per title ) com@@ pressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or other formats like the Lost FLA@@ C .
&quot; for the first step , the reading of the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . nearly every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed , this needs to be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ till ( for O@@ GG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ erer as well . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions already exist , but it is probably not necessary to compile something yourself . if for example FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is also not required . &quot;
which codi@@ fication / File Format shall be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to co@@ er@@ ers , audio quality and com@@ pression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying electronic audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the protection of audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to handle any copy of audio CD ; it is not possible to handle the mechanisms of cop@@ ier . avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while the installation needs to be done only once ( the interior dialog , however , it can be called up until a suitable configuration has been found ) , afterwards the daily handling of a &amp; CD is explained to the hard drive . this leads ( hopefully ) to an understanding of the sl@@ ender &apos;s approach that you frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc . ) &quot;
&quot; can get information from the free@@ DB from the internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is recorded manually . &quot;
&quot; this is only a brief list of commands of the main window . on the page step by step example , find more information such as this program is used as well as screens@@ hot with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD data according to the establishment of inquiry in the tab CD@@ DB . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case must be the connection to the Internet . ) &quot;
starts the reading and - if an en@@ coder has been configured in the storage system settings in the furnis@@ hing code settings - the coding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder , so that the choice with a different en@@ coder can be read as the default . it is to be noted that before the en@@ coder is configured in the &apos; tab Ko@@ di@@ erungs@@ Settings in the Device dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already cli@@ pped file is selected instead of a full &amp; CD ; to look and cook . &quot;
&quot; opens the furnishings around the type of messages ( such as protoc@@ ols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programmes events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; stop ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main introduc@@ tory dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different cardboard cards ( like en@@ coder , to placing the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes key quality , co@@ er@@ ers and com@@ pression rates and helps you choosing the right Ko@@ di@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a lost audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the small com@@ pression rates and hardly any available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats , the information through data com@@ pressed depending on its psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG can now have an easy advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality in lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but more about this bit@@ rate the differences become less important as both Ko@@ di@@ erer can produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still delivered with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions &quot;
+ high up to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality with low bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - when only music is to be heard from a computer or machine @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG devices are available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto @-@ stere@@ otype . today - initially , these devices do not only support the MP3 format . &quot;
a brief list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting com@@ pression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ squee@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good visibility for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ squee@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , com@@ pression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ squee@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , com@@ pression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , com@@ pression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and auto@@ Stere@@ os@@ ystems . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ squee@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you necessarily want the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that are manually entered or obtained through the program automatically from the free@@ DB over the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be given / needed with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the codi@@ fication program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with codi@@ fication programs , there is often a combination of program meant for the Ko@@ di@@ erer and this parameters here . the manual or help to the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s can be coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; added . the result looks as follows : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
&quot; this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = Kno@@ pf@@ ile drawing in the assistant ) : &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s what the free@@ DB is : a free database , where people can read the audio CDs open up , so that all others can download this information instead of spoken by itself : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc . , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I am not supposed to be legal ; however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information contained therein can be added publicly on the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so either the artist can still get damage to the music or CD ; business , physical or virtual , can be obtained . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; C@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to actively choose a cross box ( sending an address ) . for the use of free@@ DB can be used with a different ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address used in this type of configuration , so it seems , the e @-@ mail address used for retri@@ eve the data from the server ( This may only be the programmer who reviewed the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for use of free@@ DB is set up , the geograph@@ ically closest to mirror server should be used . this saves band@@ width on the network and balances the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a recent list of mir@@ rors for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during the reading of a &amp; CD . alternatively you can download the complete database or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which read program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in W@@ AV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used to know exactly what you want to know in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading from audio CD ; see To note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package has to be installed on the right distribution first , if this has not yet been done . &quot;
&quot; to save the sophisticated W@@ AV files , the co@@ er@@ ers can be chosen and thus the desired file format . at the first opening , there are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a lost @-@ free com@@ pression for audio data ) to the tab of the body . other Ko@@ di@@ erer can be added to this tab . &quot;
&quot; the Ko@@ di@@ erer package has to be installed from the application of Linux distribution , before the codi@@ ors may be used . for more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer is in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer . &quot;
after installing a coding software you can receive more information about his switches from entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a consumer window ( eg ; console ) . this must be replaced by the name of the installed code .
this can have many causes . check the setup of equipment recording of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc . ) . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD . this will not succeed !
&quot; there is one chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; read the complete manual , everything understood , but are somehow still uns@@ ure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by step example , and you will get enough information to set out those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will launch the program for the first time to set everything up and our first &amp; CD . we will be l@@ ame &apos; --@@ squee@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; you need to be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . an appropriate package for l@@ ame can be found as not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is made and that you own writing ( eg ; trying to copy it with the Con@@ quer@@ or something ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic insights of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something which will probably be done only once , &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD , which needs to be repeated for every application &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; here we determine the Ko@@ di@@ erer to com@@ pression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used to use the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not be able to modify one &amp; CD at any time , once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the equipment recording is transferred to the read@@ able program to make it the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link on the actual device @-@ record of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , so helps a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of equipment for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the map of general settings . here gi@@ bears no much to do . here , an additional transformation can be defined . in our example everything will be displayed / inspired , as in the screens@@ hot . &quot;
&quot; only in case of un@@ complete information can be selected , so you will be informed if data are ab@@ sent to the creation of keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
the card card CD ; -@@ settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and leave the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded over the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the computer must be connected with the internet during the reading of the &amp; CD ; to allow it to access the free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second selection field is easier , is a &amp; CD ; entry found , starts immediately the align@@ ing of the &amp; CD ; which is later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the fil@@ en@@ ame directory / fil@@ en@@ ame or fil@@ en@@ ame can be easily changed and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; aside from this example , further to note : if you want to enter everything manually , you can use the sel@@ ections and free@@ DB mode , if you use the database beforehand . however , this information about 620 MB large , think this happens twice . to free@@ DB must be selected , at least the first one . the mode will be set up on the following cardboard card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for the retri@@ eve of the CD ; information from the free@@ DB server via the Internet . how do you know the system you want to get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . put it all the way in the screens@@ hot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mir@@ r@@ ored server near you . on this way , the burden will be distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will be a first attempt to work . &quot;
&quot; both function uni@@ form@@ ly as regards the server , since many fire@@ walls finds the protocol of 88@@ 80 standard , there is perhaps more fortunate to be lucky with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to provide any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server should be able to turn it off .
simply take the settings of the screens@@ hot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp on your computer exists )
&quot; number at the same time : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time only an existing drive ? parall@@ el@@ es Read and code ? the author does not know it , therefore just try . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading of the latest piece , cross this to the &amp; CD , at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; customised folder for temporary files : if you cross this tick , then you have to be stored the path / folder , in which the W@@ AV files are created , the field is not transfer@@ ed , the files in the private folder , do not forget that if you want yourself some with the W@@ AV files . &quot;
&quot; all this is how it is in the screens@@ hot . the command is somewhat long , under certain circumstances it must be brought to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , it is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo equipment . the resulting bit@@ rate factor is 6.3 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compromise factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting tags on version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1.@@ &apos;@@ ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags you can also be deleted at a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output _ file ( including the complete path ) .
put the rest as in the screens@@ hot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously co@@ zing W@@ AV files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to co @-@ operate more than a W@@ AV file at the same time .
&quot; this is , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is chosen as a standard for any reading of a &amp; CD . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section you describe how the process of reading the &amp; CD is specified on the hard drive . we will build MP3 files . first , a link to the Internet is built , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data of the free@@ DB will be described , must be repeated for any per@@ missible &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; since we use one &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in free@@ DB , the screens@@ hot is a little different from the for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of getting it from the internet . comments will point out to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this examples can be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this has not yet been done so now the &amp; CD is now to be defined in the main window , which has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screens@@ hot . this only when the &amp; CD is identified ; as an audio CD ; it could be identified and read from cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen , then you will find in the section questions and answers after the help or proceed back to the previous section concerning basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD has been successfully picked up by the free@@ DB , all the titles of the pieces could already be filled , and also the name of the artist and the album are shown . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; keys for your &amp; CD , there will be a window built @-@ in , and you can select the database entry , which you think is best suited to your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have the cross @-@ box for automatic query string of Free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually generate this by choosing the first button in tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but get the data from the internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - entering the CD @-@ Data and the Tit@@ le of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screens@@ hot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input &apos; updates title &apos; to the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
&quot; the artist no longer has to be inspired in the input field &quot; &quot; Current titles &quot; , &quot; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common to all the pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; warning : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data of the free@@ DB is not empty , but it is always a good idea to examine the content of the CD editor . however , it is always a good idea to start the content of the CD editor , so that you can not only start with the artist &apos;s name or not ... ) but also to consider whether there are any unwanted remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limited the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and titles of a piece , and on only 28 signs for the commentary box . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags you have unlimited field length , so take a look at the tab for default settings ; take a look at the Settings &apos;s Settings . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
&quot; tags are not supported by all the co@@ er@@ ers or file formats , and can be seen in the help of the Ko@@ di@@ erer in order to get more information . &quot;
&quot; simply select an entry which obviously corresponds to the style of the exp@@ iring CD . in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD . for more information go to the Internet site of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are available at Rock . &quot;
after the choice of &apos; OK &apos; come back to main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
&quot; the window of the CD Edit@@ ors will be back and you will see that the fields for the album is already filled with the given data , which we have collected for the first piece . just enter the title of the piece , in any case and other information you wish . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way until you have all the title dates of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third kno@@ b of the tool@@ bar . please note that the artist and the album are displayed on the piece list .
&quot; note that there is a check @-@ sign in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked as marked . just a simple click on the line turns the choice of the piece , or drop the button all pieces select at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button selecting the reading process , this window will appear for confirmation . to OK , then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what runs out . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab orders for switching on the order window . it is in the upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window for controlling the orders . the first piece is shown straight on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left part of the window in the status line .
&quot; this error message can be seen if you are trying to work with a Ko@@ di@@ erer , which you still have not installed . pieces which were not successfully coded with a red &apos; X &apos; within the order list . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the folder for the tmp file and the target folder are not what we have entered here for example . have you checked whether you write write access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now it is clear , why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; the order 1 will read the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 to the format MP3 . hence , reading and ex@@ iting parallel . note the status registration in the bottom part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has not found configur@@ ations to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able , the number of parallel processes is unclear . the machine used with AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem at simultaneous reading and code ( of however two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the final title will be read , while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queue of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is coded , a small window will be built with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. and 4.@@ x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate com@@ pressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the co@@ er@@ ers of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are talking with CV@@ S as part of k@@ dem@@ nity media package . if you are talking with CV@@ S , you can already download an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions are already included a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you probably have done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to individuals who compile data files , and not intended for users to use a pre @-@ compiled package of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs if it is running , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program called for many different programs , has many variations of settings . best read the step by step example to get the options and settings . it shows monitors the different cardboard cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used for example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked up after the first time of the program , without having a cl@@ ue as it will proceed from this somehow empty screen ( especially when the date of the program does not drive audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an unusual short menu item . &quot;
&quot; what is it ? who reads this , has probably already started the program . it should look something like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot sustain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to add or change it may do it . at least only after cont@@ acting the author . and if you read this , he gave this section and is therefore agreed with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange , if you have succeeded in getting the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need this information , but ... &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others he has some features with real @-@ time graph@@ ics and kar@@ a@@ oke @-@ authenticity characters of texts also have some features that have other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI @-@ players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support function . &amp; k@@ mid ; supports also the &amp; Linux ; Ultra @-@ ound project operator who is needed for the CIS . AL@@ SA is included as soon as there is a sequ@@ encer .
&quot; Sch@@ mid : displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI @-@ channel by high@@ lighting the penet@@ rated keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can move in &amp; k@@ de ; each MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window on the Mid @-@ box can be drawn .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( songs or textures files ) . K@@ Mid determines the method used in each case .
&quot; seat support . if you end &amp; k@@ de ; during the passing of a song , K@@ Mid starts again next time with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter , you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select opening ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you choose the desired song . &quot;
you can also let a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ Window drop . this also works with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to complete a piece of music , open it and then click the button &quot; &quot; play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry to@@ play out of the menu piece or drop the Spac@@ eb@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts , once you drag it to a collection . ( with several pieces , they are added to a collection and then re@@ played together . ) &quot;
&quot; once and k@@ mid , a play takes place , you can jump on any position by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller back and forth . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to turn left and right of the Tem@@ plates . to get back the original speed , click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the Le@@ ath@@ ass@@ el has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the Le@@ ading as a pressure on the button break or the finish of the menu entry in the menu piece , thus breaks the play@@ press while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the playing . &quot;
lyrics texts can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use Tex@@ ter@@ eig@@ nis , others use li@@ ed@@ contexts and another both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically selected , so you have nothing to set manually . if so , in the menu settings the entry is automatically selected , you will still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other kind . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set a incident fixed , select from the menu settings the entries of textures or songs . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you summar@@ ise . in this section the sequence is played , how you can use the collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , open first to the collection @-@ camp . these can be found in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the jumps in the collection . &quot;
in the temporary collection all the songs you want to not want to add any other collection .
&quot; when using the application , this collection is not saved . concerns the case you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , she needs to be in the collection camp . there you can add a song with the button &quot; &quot; Add to Di@@ et . it appears in turn the file dialog , with which help you can select the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection .
&quot; if automatic adding to the collection is enabled , a piece by opening ( using file opening or drag and drop ) automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; when Autom@@ atic , adding the collection is not activated , when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and pun@@ ched . this collection will then be added to the continued pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection of collecting , the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are displayed . if you select the row from the sub@@ menu down order of the menus , the songs are ab@@ re@@ played in order , as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be newly defined . &quot;
&quot; to send a song , choose it in the collection @-@ camp , or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song , choose the button &quot; &quot; next song &quot; &quot; the entry next song from the menu or push the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to turn the song back , select the button predic@@ table pieces , the entry predic@@ table pieces from the menu or push the arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection to the collection , and click the delet@@ ing collection and click the button Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection can not be deleted . however , this does not play a role as it is by leaving &amp; k@@ mid , not saved . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for Syn@@ thesizer , which are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events turn into events that understands the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI Map , which conver@@ ts all events of the type change patch to B@@ right piano in events of the type change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and thus makes a trumpet sound , if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound@@ card , you do not need a MIDI Map because all Sound@@ maps are GM -@@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and CIS cards , FM radio devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is no programs to create MIDI maps . so you must edit the appropriate file from hand ( using your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all necessary settings for the play of a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section that may appear as often as desired . a prerequisite for it is , however , that each appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
&quot; you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a paragraph has reached . &quot;
&quot; please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be used for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
in this section the patches of General MIDI is shown on your specific keyboard . general use looks as follows :
&quot; please note that the left side of the body sign is ignored . it is believed that GM Pat@@ ches are set in the right sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all notes that supports this instrument , using the tone with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) that is similar to a gun . to do this , enter the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so now a MIDI file should play a score with patch 127 ( gun @-@ casting ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and performs the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant , with which every sound represents another Persian instrument ( drum , bas@@ ins , Marac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and does not have the one in which the sound means the tone height of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to indicate how T@@ ones appear on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you just need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are mainly used to form tones on the per@@ ky channel . look as an example for the provided key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to clear some channels on other . if you want to switch between the first and second channel , simply make it simple in the CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the perc@@ ussion on a certain channel ( general MIDI on channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi @-@ De@@ vices , 16 channels , the CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered between 0 and 15 , assembled by following the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; N is the channel , which is built on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map will of course use the name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , all events will be used as patch x . &quot;
the option For@@ ce@@ patch can be useful for example to always use the per@@ k@@ elling patch on the per@@ c channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ Rati@@ o will be multip@@ lied , in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events will be multip@@ lied with the value n , this is calculated with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used , so that in the Map file ( no dec@@ imal hear@@ ken@@ es ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM indicates that a keyboard , which is a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , a sound higher to play . unfortunately , we try to find some key@@ boards about two t@@ ints up to an oc@@ tave . to try the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit by &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI Map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . these can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these cl@@ ots you see which sounds just played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a selection list , where you have changed an instrument , the button does not have more green , but red to indicate that no longer is used the original tool . &quot;
the Kan@@ al@@ ansicht has ( until now ) two different views to indicate the played sounds . the view can be displayed in the menu Settings under the Point Kan@@ al@@ ansicht : settings
&quot; the speed @-@ LCD shows the speed when a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow down . to change the pace , use the arrows to turn left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc . . this allows the same MIDI files on two different devices to very different results , as well as two different musicians play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; well , I can impose nobody &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file 4 MB needs a similar sound quality . at a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything . &quot;
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( r@@ pm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; which happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without having support . to remove the problem you must download a source distribution and install ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s Home )
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agreed , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag and drop . just open the folder you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all files from , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
&quot; before , you necessarily activate the setting of automatic adding to the collection . otherwise , the files are added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; you can taste the arrow on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD , to slow down the back . to restore the standard temp@@ o , you can double click on the LCD screen . &quot;
I have been on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ working area a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI @-@ folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; in this way I must finish a MIDI @-@ file or which I want to play a file on this desktop or I want to switch a file to the window and the desired file into the window by &amp; k@@ mid .
&quot; if you only want to listen to a file , without adding it to a collection , switch off the setting of automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection . opening of files &quot;
&quot; suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ Midland . first just want the first file to play . so make the setting of automatic adding to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; then un@@ lock yourself , also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid pic@@ ks and a collection with all three files . how do you do that ? &quot;
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you so much ! if I see these songs or the postcard , anim@@ ates me that , continue to &amp; k@@ mid . to program . &quot;

&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ a@@ oke files , if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid , or even if you just want to make me happy , write an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; you really make me a huge pleasure when you send me a postcard from your home or an MID@@ I@@ - / Kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . all who want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , but if you want to get in contact with me as I might have the file . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and asked anyone money for money . I would like to stress that I can only program myself , because / if I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) . &quot;

&quot; my thanks also applies to Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for the test of the CIS support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia , for the test of A@@ we support , Marc Die@@ f@@ enb@@ ru@@ ch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , a error message , or even a suppor@@ tive email . &quot;
&quot; and of course , my thanks also applies to all those outstanding musicians on the net that give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this can be found &amp; k@@ mid ; also on his homepage , which can be found at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ lar@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search information and look at pictures . you will also find links to sites with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc . &quot;
a sound@@ card . I recommend you a good sound@@ card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality is essentially dependent on your sound@@ card . it &apos;s not the same if you use a FM @-@ device or an A@@ we card .
&quot; if you do not have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound@@ card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; labels is a simple user interface for M@@ player , ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program used to play video files of M@@ Player or PH@@ ON@@ ON supported formats , as well as playing DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for the sn@@ app@@ name ; was not yet ended than &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The KDE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made from so called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there are always the window with the central point . either , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is a information window , which is only then displayed when information can be found in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to send the preferred links below the reader sig@@ nia , but these are separate entries . if you want to create a list of entries , that are to be played by one another , so you should use the category thum@@ b playlist . &quot;
&quot; naturally , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy level . when you copies an entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups to the current category will be copied and the play@@ back begins with the shown entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; actual piece &apos; , television and perman@@ ency playlist may also be changed by direct em@@ itting the XML configuration files . of course one can only do if &amp; km@@ player . of course , you can only change the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / km@@ player , but also by the application itself . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this section is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , the menu has to be selected with playlist , and selected either the editing mode , or another category will be selected . &quot;
all changes have been lost when editing mode or another group will be selected without having the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; km@@ player , some functions can be switched only by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation at the Star@@ ts and Be@@ end can be disabled by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / features play@@ ers@@ c and change from &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; km@@ player ; will be the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / x@@ k@@ de / share / apps / x@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be an supported XML file .
&quot; the animation at the starting point doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically ended by opening another source . this would be disturbing the end though , the user can finish the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the adver@@ t of a favourite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g D@@ ur ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g D@@ ur = &apos; in@@ serts ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ ted ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ ted ; in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L that are supported by &amp; km@@ player .
there is a rider to the configuration of M@@ Player in the configur@@ ations@@ dialog by &amp; km@@ player . here the path from the M@@ player and the storage size of the data stream from the network and other things can be adjusted .
another tool for de@@ bug@@ ging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of km@@ . here is the output of m@@ player visi@@ bly .
there is no rider for this play@@ able in the configur@@ ations@@ dialog by &amp; km@@ player . everything must be configured with manual mach@@ ining of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / features / m@@ play@@ ers@@ c . here is an example like a &quot; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa .
&quot; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; km@@ player . it can be inserted even the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML . &quot;
&quot; to add &quot; &quot; flash &apos; in HTML pages , it needs to reproduce the &amp; km@@ player ; module as a service provider for the m@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the furnis@@ hing dialog file assignment . &quot;
&quot; the kon@@ quer@@ or or m@@ otel ; is to launch in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . the st@@ amped process is called kn@@ p@@ player . if there is no errors , the back@@ end issue is displayed within &amp; km@@ player . ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; for example , a given back@@ end for a specific m@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manual Change of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / features play@@ ers@@ c . for instance , PH@@ ON@@ ON should re @-@ present all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; features can be downloaded from TV cards , either via M@@ player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be installed , the user needs to be used for used dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( video data rec@@ orders ) settings in the settings below - &gt; Source &gt; V@@ DR@@ -- &gt; X@@ Video Port , which is selected to be selected , e.g. is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
&quot; because the V@@ DR support of km@@ player can only use X@@ Video ( probably this type of play@@ back of video equipment under Linux is the only one working ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux server needs to be functional for the X server ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; internal Player for the sources use different names . at the time of origin of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , accurate source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , book@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they start with the play@@ back of the playlist . &quot;
are there hints such as I can make my CD@@ ROM drive more when I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is used as user root after the inclusion of the device . it is imperative to ensure that / dev / c@@ drom shows on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
X@@ ine will start slowly but then every time my CPU must be tested on their performance ?
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ m@@ t. k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the latest saved value , only the first time x@@ ins will check the CPU . &quot;

lat@@ ex ; : a professional bri@@ efs application . among Unix @-@ like systems is probably accessed on the package &amp; tex@@ tual ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the software used &amp; Linux ; for installation should be applied to the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; -@@ project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the k@@ ile ; website included .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation should be considered . however , the support for this project or its documentation should be desired , the contact details should be made on the k@@ ile . &quot;
step further questions or when comp@@ iling from &amp; k@@ ile ; on or will be desired this should be addressed to the mailing list c@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ environment in a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programmes . furthermore it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the possibility to complete , comp@@ iling and error tools for this . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant to provide the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and its opportunities to learn the manual should be drawn to Kate . user of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; Kate ; start .

&quot; just as other identi@@ fier languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction with which the most common properties such as paper format , side @-@ numbers and text color starts with the command \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN { document } , and must be shut down with the command \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN { document } . &quot;
&quot; the fast @-@ entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a valid feature for the fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile , which provides some possibilities for the creation of the document . you can also specify some settings on the document . &quot;
&quot; description : hereby the type of document document is found : articles ( article ) , book &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , Articles ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , Proj@@ ector &#91; Be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined . &quot;
coding : with this the string coding of the system should be dis@@ continued . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 -@@ coding as standard . best should be UT@@ F @-@ 8x additional ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for inclusion of them only in the cross area .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) : the documents of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
&quot; now , new users will not worry about it . only a brief description of the functions and further information can be found in the section . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - as well as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ fitting ) ; it &apos;s easy to find that any mathematical environment is not closed . however it is possible to save you by the modest appearance of the output file . however it is possible to save you through the high@@ lighting time and time . &quot;
with the automatic im@@ balance of the environments is created by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN { command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates a blank line ( for input of the text ) and the related lines ( e.g. \ \ to { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu .
&quot; all documents are usually separated into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; ex@@ hor@@ ted the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most common and subtle element ) : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the document in the struc@@ turing , the individual elements can be changed by the mouse click on the respective and seen . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be the ration@@ alization really useful . once an DVI ; -@@ file &#91; framed file &#93; &#93; , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by a click with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer on the appropriate line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI @-@ file contained a description of the form@@ att@@ ed document and also other information such as font and is beside PDF the most useful em@@ output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools to view , conversion and print of DVI , files for different systems and systems . &quot;
when using the information you are looking for the elements of DVI ; -@@ file with the editor used and once on an element in the DVI ; -@@ file cli@@ cked is the exact opposite of it . once upon a section in the DVI @-@ file is cli@@ cked up to a section in the DVI @-@ file ; the text is cli@@ cked up to the corresponding position in DVI ; -@@ viewer .
Master @-@ Document : this function is simplified when working with multiple files . with a Master document the work is simplified with other integrated .@@ tex files . when using a project a project @-@ document project can be set to project settings .
quick @-@ saving : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code will compile and the result automatically displayed ( if no error in the source code are available ) .
&quot; file wax : in this mode , the DVI ; -@@ file on your iPhone , w@@ ak@@ es@@ â , and it is not a call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece . after the quick@@ set . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the processing tool@@ bar the three main types of selection should be stri@@ pped into the document . the first choice field is designed for quick limb@@ s of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... &quot;
&quot; the selection is added to the addition of articles such as tags , fu@@ ther , notes or refer@@ r@@ als . the options available are : &quot;
name : with this command a name is created for one section or an image or an element .
reference : is used to the reference to a fixed term ( selection key ) .
&quot; when using c@@ itation , a selection list will be shown with liter@@ ary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this works only if the file is necessary for a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; i.e. the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can be written by hand even in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last drop @-@ down with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ AF@@ TER is used for defining the fonts . it can be defined the scrip@@ tures for the main text , the joints , etc . there are the following scrip@@ tures available : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; k@@ ile , two choices are available for preparation : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document types and determines the settings . 2 . the document may be written by reason . &quot;
&quot; the brack@@ ets according to the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pts &#93; does the scri@@ be fixed , the scri@@ be is not fixed at the beginning , this can also be done in text . &quot;
once the above source code has been entered the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the simpl@@ est way of this is to use the men@@ Ã ¼ s building or of the button @-@ growing fast .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storage it is automatically saved .
&quot; however , the comp@@ iling of the document is mis@@ ed , should be searched in the log according to errors . when using quick@@ set should be started and ey@@ epi@@ ece . automatically this is not the case , should also be observed this protocol . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English . environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the scrip@@ tures must have another scrip@@ tures . the command \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ . { environment } is to put the description of the scri@@ be in the surroundings . &quot;
the allow@@ ances are only accessible within the area ( from \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) .
&quot; there are many possibilities to enhance the legi@@ bility of legi@@ bility and usability of the document . for example , certain fonts , fats , cur@@ sive , etc. can be added either with the command \ \ . or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ B@@ EG@@ IN { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ se and is long as long as he is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be shown with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ Per@@ cent@@ age : created a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN { One } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; indic@@ ative language follows now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile .
&quot; once in the wiz@@ ard a bit of text was entered , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be accomplished . therefore , a quot@@ ation , a few places in the fat and cur@@ se and a poem to use to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been seen , using Editor @-@ View or Str@@ g E can again be returned to the editor ( with an external viewer ) , its window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI , the document has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script file . simply try and fun . &quot;
DVI ; is an independent file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ eig@@ ni@@ r ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of your computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi edition like printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ transform@@ ers or computer shi@@ el@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; for the print of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . during the 7th step - after the clicking on DVI , the document can be printed by means ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is correctly set ) . &quot;
&quot; tool@@ bar norm@@ alized the conversion of DVI , -@@ file into other formats . once the DVI ; -@@ file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was created , the transformation may begin by means of space in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
to search for the direct jump from the editor to the appropriate position inside the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ bin@@ os @-@ files . therefore only Modern under settings are to set up ... tools br@@ auen .
&quot; to find the advance search , the mouse c@@ ursor on a line of source must be positioned and tight@@ ened in a preliminary search . the jump to the appropriate position in DVI ; -@@ spect@@ ator takes place . &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document by &amp; k@@ ile ; set up and on the appropriate line . this must set up &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as a text editor ( set ey@@ epi@@ ece set up ... Editor )
&quot; if in case of quick@@ set of the &amp; DVI , the viewer should not be able , there may be an error , this will appear in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log file contents is the error source in the source text . in the editor , the con@@ versions of the La@@ TeX errors are always the line where the error appears . to view the faul@@ ty line , must be cli@@ cked on the error in the log file and p@@ ile ; jump to the faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; as soon as on the respective button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the sub@@ mitting template for the document . the above features include : &quot;
&quot; when selecting le@@ verage document , a document can be written either from scratch or the wiz@@ ard for the fast creation of a new document . further information can be included in the section . &quot;
&quot; remote user of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates will be in &amp; k@@ ile , created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
to create a new template comes either a existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; -@@ file ge@@ ff@@ ed or a new file will be created . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template by creating an existing document and selection of file template .
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using file , some strings are replaced by other data ( such as name or string coding ) . these variables can be set up in settings : settings . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are to be replaced : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ L@@ ENT@@ RI@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string will be replaced by entering the document class . typically they are used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ L@@ ENT@@ RI@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { item } .
the easiest way to create a template is using the wiz@@ ard and the associated entry for the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way the following steps have been completed :
&quot; when creating a new document , the individual model instead of the standard can be selected . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files will be created , a simple way to create a template , should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibilities of reading and remember@@ ing from many different kinds of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) can be made within the menu item directly from &amp; k@@ ile .
&quot; to learn more about &amp; Kate , and to experience his features the manual should be drawn to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile , can start there directly with reading the chapter in the editor of &amp; Kate ; &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ command@@ ing reference that can be accessed through the menu @-@ help La@@ TeX reference . it contains a detailed description of virtually all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use can be used as well as their syn@@ tax .
&quot; double @-@ click with penet@@ rated shr@@ g button , round the &amp; tex ; that means that in this way , clicking on \ \ par \ \ Auth@@ ski@@ p merely \ \ par is selected . &quot;
&quot; when pul@@ ling the text with penet@@ rated , the full text becomes automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
when using the arrow buttons with penet@@ rated revolutions can be selected parts of the source type in the editor window .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; has the possibilities to search the most diverse types of source texts and to highlight them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; orders of the normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ul@@ ae are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assist@@ ants can include a special jumping stamp or the corresponding ke@@ eper points . this is also highlighted the jump @-@ stamp , so that it is automatically en@@ coded in the first input of a character . &quot;
&quot; the editing is probably one of the main aspects of turning a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; though &amp; Kate ; already excellent features , were added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; specific commands ; special orders for their selection . under mach@@ inations , the following commands are included in the text selection : &quot;
&quot; placing a complete paragraph ( group of lines which included on both sides a blank line ) . with a paragraph there is not a text containing all contents ( as in other text editors ) . these extended meaning can not be included with all contents of the source text ; therefore , the only explo@@ iting thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; therefore , that the ab@@ ide by two blank lines are separated . &quot;

&quot; with this command , the end of the current environment will be bl@@ amed ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the command to the pits in the environment . &quot;
when the c@@ ursor before or within the command \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN { surrounding } is found toward the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering a lot of merge environments , you can quickly go to the spot@@ ted view . this command compar@@ es the most recent ambient environment , so that the scre@@ ened ambient structure is not to be del@@ ectable . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers also special orders for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups that are determined by br@@ aces { ... } . under mach@@ ining TeX groups are a few important commands that suit those from mach@@ ining environment .
&quot; with this command , the start of the current group is pr@@ inter@@ ed ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly in front of the pe@@ aked brack@@ et . &quot;
&quot; with this command , the end of the current group will be bl@@ amed ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the so@@ aked brack@@ et . &quot;

&quot; although &amp; Kate is already a good source of implementation , this in &amp; k@@ ile , was added to these in &amp; k@@ ile ; all of which are different modes ( mostly for automatic im@@ print ) . all these modes can be set up for automatic im@@ balances . all these modes can be set up according to settings ... &quot;
in the beginning a new environment using the command \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN { environment } becomes a k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ to { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; when selecting the back taste , the last character of the input will be removed and you realize the comprehen@@ sion list . on the other hand , the list may also be reduced by entering another letters . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are offered by &amp; k@@ ile ; alternatively , jumping stamp will be repaired , so that a simple jump to these positions by mach@@ ined jumping stamp , and which can be repaired . &quot;
&quot; under settings k@@ ile , set up ... k@@ ile ; mer@@ ged you can be made to these lists . there may be different types of boards , and / or lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands , as well as value @-@ to @-@ use of the common language . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is not valid for the comprehen@@ sion of environments . it &apos;s always used for a few letters with \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN , and the call of the processor is used to result . on the other hand , the environments are so often used that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for understanding the in@@ consistency of the environments . &quot;
&quot; in the call of the full calculation mode , the full @-@ filled environment or the touch press release will be automatically folded , and it appears \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN { . after that , the environment can be kept in the simpl@@ est manner and be termin@@ ated by pressing the input . &quot;
&quot; after this is done , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; acknowled@@ ges that it is a list of lists , is even a first \ \ item command with introduced . &quot;
&quot; under settings k@@ ile , set up ... k@@ ile ; de@@ able settings to these lists are made . this mode uses the default list of the comprehen@@ sion mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ prec@@ epts . &quot;
&quot; http : / / www.bing.com / searc .... s + vegas + metro + nevada The lists can be replaced by L@@ Ã ¤ n@@ g@@ ere strings , which is immediately arranged by L@@ Ã ¤ n@@ g@@ ere strings . as an example of a cancellation list , the file exam@@ ple@@ .c@@ wl , is included in the example of the entry L = \ \ La@@ TeX . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L entered and the word comp@@ lied with the word processor , or the word processor , or the short@@ cut , the letter L replaced by the string \ \ La@@ TeX . &quot;
&quot; some of them are not helpful for automatic im@@ balances . however , it has been realized that many guards in a document has been written more than once . so it offers &amp; k@@ ile , for all already written walls . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the men@@ dic@@ ate settings ... bo@@ ile completely shi@@ el@@ essly shi@@ el@@ ded . here , the balance can also be defined for the display of the completion . &quot;

&quot; the dialog supports the design of graphics as simple as possible . in addition , the basics of the graphics formats should be divided and notice . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for example and new orders of pages . will be re@@ arranged the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tools new and then associated with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to watch the result of the work , you need to compile the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the men@@ Ã ¼ s creation comp@@ iling , creating and creating view . &quot;

&quot; an accomplished refer@@ en@@ z for press &amp; tex ; moreover , it is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather is a complete operating manual for the search for a certain form@@ atting , it is divided into a very rough document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents that &amp; tet@@ ex ; / lyrics , the fin@@ ite of the right document is not always easy . as a simple help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / lyrics live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ et@@ k that contains a database with all too &amp; k@@ ile ; available documents and documents a graphical area . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the major advantage is the search for package names or stroke . by &amp; k@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .

&quot; the plug @-@ ins , that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; invite you to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it will not wait any of the additional functionality immediately and need not wait until someone can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used . more about it can be found below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start with the menu plug @-@ ins . thus , the following dialogue is opened : &quot;
&quot; this dialog enables all to manage and add new plug @-@ ins , and add new to each other . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it : &quot;
&quot; here you can enter the search path . when adding , plug @-@ ins without a storage location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to the search of the plug @-@ in . &quot;
often work on a project several individuals in a type of hierarch@@ ical relationship between each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with shift ; F@@ 7 project project @-@ properties are configured .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nickname is the nickname of the user and serves to unique identification .
&quot; one member can have several roles in the project , such as a team leader as well as sub@@ project leader . &quot;
&quot; the user can search for himself from the list of team members , who he is . this happens by choosing the team member from the list and set the place as pus@@ hes . currently selected member ( their identi@@ ties ) appears fat after you are : text . &quot;
nick@@ names and setting their own identity are important regarding news and notes . see for further information on comments .
&quot; in addition to the overview of your team there is another advantage by the recording of the members of the team : it may be an event for information to the team manager , if something particular happens . see in for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that will be executed when a bit of particular is happening in the project . an example would be the record of opening and closing a message , if a file is saved , or a script that a file is inserted into the CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project , etc . &quot;
&quot; on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project flavor Dialog@@ es , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
&quot; an email will be sent to the addres@@ see in the recip@@ ients mentioned list . the addres@@ see can be a team@@ - or sub@@ project leader . see in , wei such lad@@ der . &quot;
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
notes to type is simple . it can be selected either the note associated entry from the editor @-@ text menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary box followed by An@@ strange text .
&quot; notes can be a determin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syn@@ tax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , whereby the nickname of the en@@ visi@@ oned nickname of team member states should be stated in the respective area or sub @-@ project names as in the following examples . &quot;
nick@@ names and re@@ els names are independent of great - or small @-@ fold but spaces around the br@@ aces and the : make the note invali@@ d .
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ atting , which DT@@ D @-@ tac@@ tic is and web@@ based form@@ ative and scrip@@ ting languages supported . &quot;
&quot; the settings can be reached via the settings menu . here are only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found . &quot;
&quot; the settings may be set up via settings Qu@@ anta , to be called . diesel @-@ dialog extends over some sites that are treated with each other . &quot;
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; concerning tags including car completion may therefore be changed . the entries are :
&quot; large / small @-@ off of tags : large / small @-@ off of automatically ne@@ p@@ added tags . normal Large / Klein@@ sch@@ elling means , the tags are included as they are described in the day XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / small @-@ off of attributes : large / small @-@ use of automatically applied attributes . normal Large / Klein@@ sch@@ elling means , the attributes are included as added as they are described in the day XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically include : if requested , is available for tags , for which the final day is optional , this immediately after that &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
&quot; not optional tags automatically conclude , as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags . &quot;
&quot; start @-@ up and finish day automatically : if switched , the appropriate day will be with@@ drawn and vice versa . &quot;
automatic survey of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding coding during penetration .
M@@ IME types : Mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . by using the standard the default devices can be recovered .
&quot; standard repertoire : the coding of newly created or in other ways than with file opening open files ( where the coding of the file can be covered ) , however , this setting will be engra@@ ved from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded in . &quot;
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D will be used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D have not been recognized . however , this setting will be engra@@ ved from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; created regularly backup copies , so that in a black@@ out , or crash the next start of the program , the document is restored from this backup . however , this is not the same as saving the file . also for not stored documents there will be a backup regularly , according to the published time . &quot;
&quot; the Pre@@ view and the documentation can be displayed either in the editor or an own view ( or the documentation in a cardboard ) , which makes it possible to see the documentation , the Pre@@ view and the implementation of the text at the same time . &quot;
set the window settings to the standard back at the next start is useful when the user interface is due to changing the M@@ DI mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views through each other . it matches the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command parameters .
&quot; the warning message area serves the taxes of the possibility to un@@ lock the display of war@@ nings , by checking up no more . &quot;
the place for change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change it . you can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the sync behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code in shared mode .
&quot; here the Par@@ ser and the struc@@ tor , which represents the figure of the Par@@ ser @-@ not@@ ch in the document , to be set in details . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the mouse @-@ clicking on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the solved action by clicking the structural tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the area of struc@@ turing settings , the visibility of knots in tree can be opened automatically when mach@@ ining and how deep in changing the structure tree will be automatically opened , while blank groups are such that no item was found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; the area for fix@@ ing of abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) that can be in@@ scri@@ bed in groups , each one can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means it can give a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ used short@@ cut means something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; here , the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plugins are a part @-@ of @-@ applications of third @-@ third page , which can be re@@ used by any one part @-@ capable application , most of the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; in inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins must be the following : &quot;
address : the path to the plug @-@ in when it is not located at a stand there like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
&quot; input : this information is transferred to the plugin when starting , it can open the current file to the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; component in the &quot; &quot; View @-@ L@@ ese &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is refused to load . just @-@ read @-@ K@@ Parts is usually to load if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : is this enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the given information is correct . then , the saving of the entries is also available if the plug @-@ in is not available in the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the Tro@@ u@@ bles@@ hooting was completely newly developed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been dis@@ solved , such as the support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin has been implemented , which allows various Impl@@ ement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
currently only one plug @-@ in available is available for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; included .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ ins in the project settings . with the Options set next to the de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plugin Options can be modified to the specific settings .
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional items appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ U@@ I : &quot;
a view in which the contents of surveillance variables is displayed . appears usually in the left dock .
&quot; a view in which all brack@@ ets , with hands @-@ numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is displayed . usually in the bottom dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger is all or part of the following functionality available .
&quot; with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , or it divi@@ des the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bit claims , when a project is opened , that a de@@ bu@@ gger is used , so that in normal case it must not be respected . &quot;
the counter@@ part to de@@ bug@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the mil@@ eage according to requirements .
sends a HTTP requirement to initi@@ ate your server request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to see the current document . the issue of this requirement is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger edition .
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger where to begin writing the script and to date information on monitoring variables and current @-@ current line . if this happens , while the script is dispos@@ ed , the execution continues after a de@@ duction requirement begins , the script starts with the requirement . &quot;
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger where to begin writing the script , without information on surveillance variables and the current line number . if this happens , while a script is given , the execution begins to proceed as soon as a requirement begins . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next assignment in the script without responding to the functions or includes .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next assignment in the script , with if possible in functions and includes further error @-@ adjusted . &quot;
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to ski@@ p the statement and go to the next , as if there is not the current one . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog , in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the surveillance value will appear in the variable view . &quot;
with this dialog a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keit@@ h Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front @-@ end and a K@@ part of x@@ sl@@ db@@ g which can be found at http : / / x@@ sl@@ db@@ g.@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many further works of Keit@@ h .
&quot; this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to adapt to your needs , and how you can help to get better . &quot;
&quot; type of document packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allow to give support for mark@@ up@@ - and scripts . they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; abilities such as car insur@@ ances ; a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web@@ developer , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and the tool@@ bar . day @-@ folder contain two medium files , the &amp; nbsp ; and equ@@ alization files with the extension of .t@@ v . tool@@ boxes are handmade , the text and instructions more quickly in a document than a user per . &quot;
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) or created automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details of the conversion .
&quot; this document describes how to create new XML files , then the &amp; nbsp ; and also tool@@ bar . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the OW@@ N file , which displays the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; its tool@@ bar provide a quick inser@@ ting of tags in a document with no risk of writing . &quot;
&quot; day @-@ folder are nothing but a folder . they contain only the &amp; nbsp ; and the Tag@@ XML files . day @-@ folder bear the name of the descri@@ b@@ tion language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.01 ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares as they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible , so that other users have a better look and more information when working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is presented in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a day document . it can only exist in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only one element type about itself otherwise . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using is &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument to function . ( only family 2 )
only for the event type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only Family 2 )
only for the type of meth@@ od is valid . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute and the attributes inside that tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ Day . this is a only element type element .
&quot; describes a attribute of a tag . this element can only exist once for each attribute . additionally , it lays the name and type of the attribute . additionally , it contains other tags you describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc . this is a only element type element . &quot;
returns the source of the source texts for the attributes in the day editors and in the attribute @-@ tree at the same time .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface inside of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used for reaching the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method is used inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting @-@ set and a method name . the arguments that can be passed to the method . can be empty or a tag@@ name % that means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container day the elements of a list are group@@ ed together . it can only exist for an attri@@ but@@ ing only once . it is a only @-@ element type element .
sets the position of the attri@@ but@@ ing of a tags within a dialogue . this day can only occur for every attribute in a dialogue only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ Day ) . the item is empty .
&quot; indicates the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for every field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this item is empty . &quot;
gives a list of elements that may happen within the defined tags . this item is a only element type .
gives a list of elements that finish a day . this item is a only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; results : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ coding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly p@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces seem to influence nothing , but watch on &amp; B &amp; lt ; signs . these should be done by &amp; amp ; and lt ; , particularly in elements such as &amp; lt ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will cause . this will not cause a leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; for checking the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is set up in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ window to start and check@@ out of X@@ ML@@ . to choose another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot;
&quot; this function is not currently available . currently , the examination occurs only when loading of the equ@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; -@@ element of the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ sch@@ ema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; in the following an example for a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , one &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this in@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag = &quot; function _ name &quot; type = &quot; function _ name &quot; type = &quot; function _ name &quot; type = &quot; string _ name &quot; type = &quot; string _ name &quot; type = &gt; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; B p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ file is also quite simple and there is an editor to be reachable via DT@@ D Bear@@ be@@ ite DT@@ D settings . this can be modified by a list of sel@@ ectable &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a newly built &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D ( / EN ) nickname = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.01 transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nickname . &quot;
an action can set with settings by setting any kind of settings ... click on New action leads to the same dialogue :
the name of this action packed short@@ cuts . with clicking the user user interface can be assigned to a short@@ list ; with K@@ one the current scanning short@@ cuts can be removed .
the simpl@@ est actions . it can be added a text in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action this text is inserted in the document on the current c@@ ursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful incentive type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , even the quick start -@@ dialog or the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
the first must be the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / Scrip@@ ts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line : &quot;
&quot; % f : we will be replaced with the current document , in case of a local document file : / from the document name . &quot;
&quot; pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text becomes unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script can request a script of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the default entry , can be determined what to send to the default output . possibilities are : &quot;
chosen text : the selected section of the document will be sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful only with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the specified application can be introduced . there are two types of output : normal edition , written on the default output . it may be specified using the text written by the default output , by which the value will set the pres@@ et output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create their own tool@@ bar . in any case it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the start @-@ ups . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add actions and configure settings . select Settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press new action button at the bottom of the window starts the editing mode .
complete all the fields below and add them to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete everything and , in case the day attributes , and you can plan their use , enable &quot; &quot; Edit Day &quot; &quot; if available , so as to enter the action possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this icon ? let us replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ download ; choose from the menu , graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ download ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pi@@ xel , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size M . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created icon does not only help to remember what the action does , but also all the other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; considering that the day start , I have decided to create an Start@@ kno@@ b as a symbol . through the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as loose , star@@ ring , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user is sign@@ aled that stimulation of this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ up ; -@@ Day in the current document is to be put . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbols , it must be connected with the action . this happens via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . besides the text box there is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder , in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the apply button and continue with other tags , so there are or which there is , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to complement some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ dial ; -@@ functions to work tool@@ bar or it should set them to better view through some separ@@ ators into several groups . make sure that the tool@@ bar set you selected for the tool@@ bar .
&quot; I want to choose the separ@@ ator ( on the left top ) for my tool@@ bar . according to the choice of the element , which is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note how the den@@ omin@@ ator does not support group@@ ing . someone , who does not know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &quot; &quot; quer@@ or &quot; &quot; button is the reverse of the start @-@ button . &quot;
&quot; the new tool@@ bar must be tested by using all the symbols , to make sure everything works . &quot;
&quot; back in the correct folder . after real@@ e@@ XML does not exist , there will be im@@ bal folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be saved in the correct folder . please adapt their tool@@ bar ( s ) when a file is opened from the appropriate type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most worth mentioning of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility of adding documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ ative language that you like most like . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; document components for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory whether someone has done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the form / script / etc . language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part is left to you , the second one we treat . &quot;
&quot; # KDE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc thee = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , for example : revision 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = # Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html &gt; Sec@@ 2.1.@@ 2@@ .html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.1.@@ 2@@ .html Part 2 = = 2@@ .html tag@@ onal = tag@@ 2@@ .html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3@@ .html
&quot; the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree . for example , see in the &amp; PHP version for example : &quot;
&quot; # KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = php of Cont@@ ents , # G@@ etting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = In@@ tro@@ duction , ... Basic syn@@ tax = langu@@ ag@@ e.@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax ... &quot;
&quot; note that # before G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that there is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for chess tel@@ es@@ sm@@ ents ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash , but try it yourself . &quot;
you realize that the content is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent at the upper end of the Construction and m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
whit@@ esp@@ ace do not affect anything but pay attention to &amp; b &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ologi@@ zed ; Resources c@@ end@@ at@@ eien are replaced .
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file which is to be displayed on the design of the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script for context @-@ help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection @-@ lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list by means of a se@@ perate context @-@ elements that are to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c just save for $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / apps / qu@@ a and copy your HTML documentation .
&quot; if you are confident that these are good and worth it to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation have been used at the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Community . you will not be able to have worked on the best Web@@ developer platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; are you not alone . it is possible to share the ex@@ cre@@ ed resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ boxes with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by means of an email to friends , partners or else who will be sent . in different places there is an email menu item , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) delivered with email , in the context menu of files and folders using templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult they can download . the contributions are checked and only available if our team takes them as correct and useless for publication . in order to make use of the resources , the resources of the resources are ensured , both for our team and for the later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have several key , you can choose an out@@ let ( URL preview can be empty ) and with a click of OK the up@@ loading will be started . &quot;
&quot; the upload can upload from the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and can be started in the context menu of files and folders using templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; after downloading an resource , just before installing , studied &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ex ; the integrity of the resource checked by checking the integrity and Sig@@ nific@@ ation . in case of problems you notice and it can then be cancelled . please note the warning message and the resource displayed correctly , a message appears with the specification of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages that is currently not created by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it can work time @-@ consuming because hundreds of day files are needed in day @-@ XML format . it gives the simpl@@ est way , a DT@@ D automatically convert into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the menu DT@@ D Store and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . afterwards , the following dialogue will appear : &quot;
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name to the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Defini@@ tional line : the string that appears in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Day , such as HTML Public - / / W@@ 3C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.01 transi@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ ml@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
&quot; adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion speed : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; nbsp ; -@@ Editor , with the details of newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are some key concepts . to understand these things and to be able to famili@@ ari@@ ze them with these fundamental concepts . this chapter is trying to bring them precisely these concepts , without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ding ones . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , locally and project related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for anyone who is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is available , ranging from tool@@ bar to safeguard company structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administr@@ ators to secure work@@ places , actions and patterns in the global tree that can then be available to anyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
&quot; local elements represent a personal collection of Web@@ developers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and work@@ stations . local items are stored in the user index , so that they can only use this user personally . &quot;
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be all done by &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns up to work stations with special actions especially for the files of a certain project . simply said , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder of the project , which is the common usage of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edit@@ ing window , the building views , the cart@@ els with information and the tool@@ bar . please propose in and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the cart@@ el with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document@@ et entries , such as close the current , other or all cart@@ els , re @-@ load , delete or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a book@@ mark or version of CV@@ S command to the current document . &quot;
&quot; click on the editing page with another context menu regarding the editing document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , processing the mouse under the mouse @-@ hand or opening the file , if the string is called below the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor a file . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the Edit@@ ors window , the tool@@ bar of the Edit@@ ors are currently taking place . at present , 4.01 transi@@ tional has been shown as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bar is displayed . in the course of further construction of tool@@ makers , the tool@@ bar will be adapted to the new features and associated users . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bar is really easy . if they want to insert it simple day , e.g. B &amp; lt ; in their document then click on the icon which has installed the day . now they can insert the data for this just one day . now they can insert a day that has several attributes , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the Bau@@ man@@ views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , they open and pass through . in the presentation with divi@@ ders stand for files , project , patterns , scripts , attributes , and documentation Bau@@ man@@ views . &quot;
project management is a powerful tool that makes &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view shows all the files in the project and allows the pamper@@ ing of files in the project by means of right mouse @-@ click . actions like hints , removal , up@@ loading or delet@@ ing the files from the medium medium can be performed using the context menu . &quot;
another option of pos@@ sessions is the use of templates . nearly everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all options open . &quot;
&quot; templates will be divided into three categories , depending on what connection they are used . the category depends on the property &apos;s performance . global templates are always available , local templates only for the corresponding users and templates in projects are only available in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of recording in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can send the available information to a script , e.g. the script should start to edit or send with e @-@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one displays the internal structure of the active document . by links @-@ clicking an element , the c@@ ursor in the document is set to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element you will open a list of commands in terms of navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among the other tree views . with it can change some attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace . this allows the change of all available attributes with a few clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation for the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; document@@ ations site , you can create your own documentation , and add a project @-@ specific documentation to a project . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two cart@@ els at the bottom of the window , can be reached via beneficial information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this cart@@ els displays information about each in Qu@@ anta current script . so , for example , the DT@@ D , the current document , and all changes to the DT@@ D are shown . &quot;
&quot; this cart@@ els shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts that are executed , giving all the error messages ( as there are ) in this window . &quot;
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ boxes are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate @-@ hand of the tool@@ bar is the ability to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to define .
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as com@@ pressing T@@ ar @-@ archive by &amp; k@@ mail ; if it is a tool@@ bar in an e @-@ mail , they can secure it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; how to secure and load them ! &quot;
it is reasonable when you want to adjust the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ist ; files on your system . therefore , auto@@ conf file a number of options that can be handed over to the configure script . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not run here . &quot;
if you have trouble passing by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check whether your path includes the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H before their bin folder . the same is true for &amp; Q@@ t ;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a Web development tool for the KDE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for a rapid web development , combined with a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions . &quot;
&quot; while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; -@@ Editor , the developers started from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , expand@@ able mark@@ up language editor would be ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
no longer limited to re@@ ines &amp; HTML ; is now confined to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; therefore the suitable &amp; IDE .
&quot; now , to the above demand must be noted that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why develop@@ es , what already someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ sc@@ af@@ fold is not only this possible but it allows users and developers to expand how they need it for their need . &quot;
&quot; enables Web@@ developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity almost any task . by the program Com@@ pletion , they can have to remember its scripts . ( more about it can be found in . ) &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web@@ design environment designed for HTML and related languages . it was developed for a fast web development and quickly became a well @-@ engine@@ ered editor developed with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developer left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .

&quot; a dialog to store your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . that creates only the name . actions need to be saved by setting settings ... added , tool@@ boxes will be stored via tool@@ boxes , and you will be wondering if you want to store the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; remo@@ ves a tool@@ bar from the visual range . it does not remove it from the hard@@ disk . if you do not edit the tool@@ bar , you are asked if you want to do this . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Team , so that the tool@@ bar appears in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new e @-@ mail message with the tool@@ bar as an attachment . &quot;

&quot; this should create a help in accordance with the settings of the mouse c@@ ursor , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely lic@@ enced , but as with any open source project the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to find the development in financial form , they find the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled up at the best from top to bottom , as after the filling of the project name the whole directory tree will be automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be set up with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features can be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; here &apos;s the name for the project to include foo . in the entry of name , file will be automatically filled . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can find the server address of the machine to which you want to access , one , except you are processed local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ unprecedented ) or an IP @-@ address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; lets this field empty , the default settings of the chosen log protocol shall be used . depending on the setting of the remote computer , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder , where the templates will be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files used for different projects should be set up instead of the standards . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder , where the tool@@ bar is stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for different projects should be set up instead of the standards . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ es@@ ystem into the project . you can choose several files or whole folder .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . with a script script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; let delete , if files , which are in the main folder of the project , are to be involved somewhere . if a project is re@@ done from the ground up , not an@@ ho@@ oks . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all the files and folder are displayed within the main folder and you can make an accurate selection of cou@@ ps . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of the files in the main folder . you can select the desired files from ho@@ oks , or , by removing the tick , cl@@ ing from the project . &quot;
&quot; the latest screen of the new project wiz@@ ard includes three settings that simplify your work , and these settings can be changed in the menu with project @-@ properties in the window @-@ m@@ ples in the sub@@ window , or with the short@@ cut Shift key ; F@@ 7 . &quot;
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional items are explained below .
&quot; a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( space holder ) , which can be updated in project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; suppl@@ em@@ ental option to top , also files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are eliminated from the project . &quot;
the project view that will be loaded on opening the project . in case you can read more about Project views .
&quot; thus , the desired bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed is found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plugin can be set with the Options button . in , the de@@ bug tool can be described . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles you can upload high @-@ loading profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a building review for the contents of the server for each profile , by pointing an own construction super@@ visor for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , processed or deleted as well as a mailing list . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; in the window event configuration , you can dis@@ able event actions and add these actions to change or delete all events . event actions will occur if a previously determined event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see into the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , it opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . &quot;
to open another project please choose project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project review gives free access to the files in the project . there the files in the current project can be managed .
&quot; folders behave as well , but are missing the entries opening and opening with ... in with the right mouse @-@ click context menu : &quot;
&quot; here , different profiles can be chosen . the profile contains information about the location of the high @-@ ad@@ missible files . &quot;
&quot; the removal of the current profile . if only there is no longer a profile , the button appears to prevent the removal . &quot;
&quot; the password is kept in the memory , and if you forget it . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading files is necessary and the rather un@@ secure password on the plate will not store the option . &quot;
&quot; this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog , if you change your mind before the up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high @-@ scale profiles can be compiled and therefore the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to different servers . when editing a profile , this dialog will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the server , to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address work . &quot;
&quot; transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO Sl@@ aves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . usually , this does not need to be changed except the network administrator is not running a service not at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the record , so it can not easily be read , but everyone with programming can be easily seen in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bar . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. through simple exchange views , various files and tool@@ boxes can be loaded and replace the current open files and tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; views can be opened in the menu project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar , opened or deleted . &quot;
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which one has the most to do . this helps not only boost productivity but also allows modification of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the own working method .
as already mentioned above are tool@@ bar in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best designed about the tool@@ bar menu . the addition of tool@@ bar is treated below in the section &quot; &quot; Add @-@ tool@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; tool@@ bar and symbols on it can be used either by means of context menu ( right @-@ clicking on the tool@@ bar ) , in which a new tool@@ bar can be executed , generating tool@@ bar or tool@@ bar that leads to the dialog , where actions on this or other tool@@ bar should be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context @-@ text to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , in addition the entries will remove action and display action which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bar and the promotions on them can set up the menu with settings tool@@ boxes ... and setting settings activities .. set .
&quot; templates are essentially cluster , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files used for short@@ cut . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used Tem@@ plates , move or modify existing folder in the pre @-@ storage space . templates have found in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you imagine for the fil@@ es@@ ystem . &quot;
&quot; some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the terms and conditions used at the beginning of each template , prior to use . &quot;
&quot; binary is all that is not pure text . it can be added any file except text , i.e. pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are included in documents with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the pre @-@ storage room under global templates . for more information about the sub@@ tree is available . &quot;
documents can be created from any text documents . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , a simple smells for the purpose and organise work in appropriate ways to efficiently be . see for more information about the templates . &quot;
this kind of templates is useful when not to be added a new document based on a template but the same text area will always be included in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a fin@@ ite system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl base . some examples are found in the pre @-@ storage space under global templates . see in for more information about the Tem@@ plates .
&quot; as the name says , these templates are used for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents that may be organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a zi@@ pped t@@ ar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; design a documentary structure to Beli@@ ever ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and choose file As a template , save as a local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project location ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the pre @-@ storage room under project templates . &quot;
select text in your document and click File As a template to save as local / project base . alternatively the selection can be easily drag@@ ged with pul@@ ling and depos@@ ited on the account template templates .
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only copy in a repository folder . it can be used all file management functions , such as pul@@ ling and depos@@ iting or inser@@ ting the file tree of conf@@ lic@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can select in file tree or in the project files tree view to a folder on the right and secure Site templates . by default , the project folder is secured , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project management enable a very target @-@ oriented advance . you can make head@@ lines and foot@@ er , or create dynamic with &amp; PHP , creating files or with them . additionally , you can keep some things in mind templates in projects very profound in mind . &quot;
the pre @-@ storage structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / apps . each of these folder corresponds one of four types of containers as explained above .
to set the behavior of a folder view in the header overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu properties . the following dialogue will be released :
&quot; a selection marked with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is canc@@ eled as soon as El@@ ter@@ ous attributes is stored . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and does not fit for everything except the regular folders . if a regular folder , it would dis@@ able templates in this path , unless they would be explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like Text @-@ Bau@@ stein . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a regular folder . &quot;
allows em@@ enting or modified text for templates in this folder . this could be a general head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and enables the head@@ lines to equi@@ p the head@@ lines with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( to display right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders , or copy and paste templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor used by the menu View . the first mode will replace the editing window in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; Editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor works as follows : he invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ page and a c@@ ursor . then you can edit and turn on the source code editor in which the changes performed in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document , which contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor , continues to edit the source text editor . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first , except that simultaneously changes both in the source text editor and in V@@ PL ; editor will be visible and the c@@ ursor in the source text editor and in V@@ PL ; editor syn@@ ch@@ ron is enabled , this mode is already active , the ke@@ yp@@ ad puts the active c@@ ursor from one window to another , whereby the position is maintained in the document . &quot;
the syn@@ cing gap between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source text editor can be set in sett@@ able via settings Qu@@ anta ; in line you can choose between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in principle it can be adjusted in addition to the time span . basically the recommendation is a small spice for fast calcul@@ ator and a large sp@@ pan for slow .
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the tools of the invisible tags in working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor will also be called once a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor will also be created , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor will also be created . this means the reduction of the suspension of the manually . &quot;
met@@ a @-@ tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. : keywords for internet @-@ search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click into the list allows the change of content : e.g. key words on the column names and key@@ word keywords key@@ word list .
CSS @-@ rules are the new way of shaping the design of pages in the browser . you can edit CSS @-@ rules with the buttons below the list or delete . a change over the list is possible as with the met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS @-@ rules is currently not supported .
&quot; it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style , by pressing on the file @-@ button button and choose the corresponding file . &quot;
&quot; the use of the c@@ urs@@ ors is like in a text processing , possible by loading with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the c@@ ursor beh@@ aves as usual . the mark works as usual . text can be inserted through typ@@ ed and may be deleted by pus@@ h@@ button or del@@ e@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way over the tool@@ bar , as in the source text editor . it is to note that the inser@@ ting of tags already exist already existing identifiable tags , e.g. if an anchor itself , each other surrounding anchor must be removed . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bar like the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . they are later used in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists of tool@@ bar are used . &quot;
&amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of style templates . in contrast to other programs for style locations the search for certain elements can be followed and the design can be pursued .
&quot; to compile &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; successfully compile , do except &amp; k@@ de ; nor the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ pped s@@ ols and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already there are . &quot;
hold in a template that is loaded in a position in one of x@@ sl@@ db@@ g loaded style or x@@ ml file or at the current node . new in x@@ sl@@ db@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db Comp@@ ati@@ bility mode can be activated in a specific file and index number and later activated .
x@@ sl@@ db@@ g determines the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a Pf@@ ad@@ ang@@ abe . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top @-@ loaded style . / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l loads , the following input is possible : &quot;
&quot; in this command to be checked on a partial or complete match with a notice called QNA@@ P@@ ME or specified above . &amp; eg ; template is agreed with any QNAP ME , which contains the string . &quot;
any nam@@ esp@@ ace of the given &quot; QNA@@ P@@ MS &quot; will be extended according to the rules described in the X@@ SL file @-@ file nam@@ esp@@ ace : test@@ 1 to http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
an un@@ question@@ able holder must be resolved for the per@@ tin@@ ent UR@@ I and po@@ inters number . this will automatically be executed when loading the first submission by x@@ sl@@ db@@ g . attitudes are re @-@ reviewed shortly after the start of each cycle .

there are many graphic tools for compar@@ ing . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I have written .
the compilation was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and corrected the same time in many places that have been fixed . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts in the same file .
&quot; the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed exactly within these lines . and there was no evidence of the places where the changes did not change . this changes did a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes made to white characters . later many more useful features have been added .
&quot; for example , if you would like to compare text for example , just copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and add it to one of the compar@@ ative window . &quot;
&quot; a function that made a lot of work , was the compar@@ ing and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a complete file @-@ browser . &quot;
also 3 @-@ way contrac@@ tion is fully supported . this is useful when two persons can work independently of each other to a piece of co@@ il and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps the dis@@ solve result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screens@@ hot shows three quantum files in connection with :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the compar@@ ing and complete complete folder . this screens@@ hot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Fol@@ der folder :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and illustrated with the possibilities today today . if you need to check co@@ de you will like this function .
&quot; differences in white characters and to@@ ul@@ ators are visible are visible . if lines differ only in a certain amount of white signs , one can see a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no trouble anymore , if J@@ em@@ and changes . ) &quot;
&quot; when one file is equal , and the other differs in a row , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all the files are the same name , but in different folders , then you can facilitate the typ@@ ing work by simply writing the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; k@@ diff@@ 3 regul@@ ator 2 folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , set , 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 regul@@ ator 3 regul@@ ator 3 regul@@ ator 3 regul@@ ators &quot;
&quot; opening dialog enables the manual type of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting from the file name ( file ... ) or selecting a most recently opened file from the file list . the open dialog will indicate your selection and shows them next time . you do not have to specify a third file , the analysis of the differences is carried out with two files . &quot;
&quot; selecting the Kno@@ pf folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the compar@@ isons and execute folders . if a file is selected for B and C , however , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if you merge sub@@ mer@@ ging , the input field for the target is active and can be dealt with . however , it is not necessarily required , immediately a issu@@ ing file . you can take this step later on saving . &quot;
the setup -@@ button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start using the compar@@ ing / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare an entire file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in open dialogue you do not want to select the dialog , you can simply close the dialog with the break @-@ button . &quot;
&quot; you can also use pul@@ ling and flow : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor , and let it drop it above a comparison window . &quot;
&quot; what thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar features . if you want to find out how much like these functions are , it would be a relatively large effort . you would only have to create two appropriate files , it in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you can just copy the relevant sections , paste and then compare . &quot;
note : currently you can &apos;t draw nothing of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the case release of text into a comparison window is supported .
&quot; warning : some editors interpret the pul@@ ling and flow of text into another program than cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost . &quot;
&quot; in the upper part of each text window , the info line of the source window includes the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the index number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ de Info @-@ line has a different color . ( note that the mouse has a while rest . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source tracks are assigned the characters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color Green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be modified over the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is recognized , one sees the color , which file is different . ( colour for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . that is in the next section ( assem@@ ble ) good . &quot;
&quot; links beside the text is the construc@@ tional column . if differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to only view the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white characters only are relevant in strings and comments , for pre@@ processor and in few , rare individual cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line that separ@@ ating the consolidation column of the text is interrupted at the places where the respective application file has no lines . when the index file is activated , the line is dot@@ ted on the surrounding lines . &quot;
&quot; the results window ( among the compar@@ ative windows ) also has an info line with the wording issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; modified &#93; when you have dealt with the result . usually it contains by the automatic composition already text , but often it contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , the stor@@ ing is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to night stem / un@@ resolved conflict to find the still remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ ative windows are used , any difference at the same time is also a conflict which must be solved manually . &quot;
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows that appears to the line of the group in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also be the current group . it is highlighted with the color background color for current range and each other is a black beams .
&quot; sometimes , by automatic composition , or by manual mach@@ ining , no further line is left in the group ; then there is only one space for the case that you change your mind and perhaps again select another source . this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a mark@@ er you may copy and otherwise insert . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; Con@@ tra @-@ Con@@ fli@@ ct ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources you select the options numbers or ign@@ oring Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; navigate in one of the windows , you can also use the arrow buttons , right , high , down , side , bottom , end , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and Str@@ g end , si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . the over@@ flow column besides the vertical image top can also be used . &quot;
in the eye tip you can also use the other buttons to manipul@@ ate . with the inser@@ ting button you can switch between inser@@ tion and rem@@ n@@ able mode . ( pre @-@ adjusted the default mode ) .
one click on the left mouse button in one of the links columns . the view of all windows is syn@@ ced at the start of each group ( as described in the section and the ed@@ itable output section ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( string image back@@ wards ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict . therefore , you must solve all un@@ resolved conflicts also after the manual . therefore , there must be differences of resolved and uns@@ ol@@ ved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark@@ ings to the cli@@ p@@ board , you must copy the Cop@@ y -@@ button ( Str@@ g @-@ C or string @-@ inser@@ ting ) . if this enabled , you will automatically copy the cli@@ p@@ board automatically and copy the manual copy . be careful with this option because you could acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
hands @-@ ins are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix @-@ variants use an index pre @-@ based program \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems . for hands @-@ based systems . K@@ diff@@ 3 reserves the hands @-@ based systems . for that reason you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not use binary files . &quot;
&quot; the options and list of the last used files will be automatically saved , and restored when the next start is restored . ( menu ) , set up a diff@@ user ... ) &quot;
&quot; select a script with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialogue also includes scripts with adjust@@ . width to choose from , you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; when you activate this option , differences in curve is depic@@ ted . if the chosen scrip@@ tures does not support this representation , does not happen at all . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colours could not be available in their pure form but would be cleared up . on these systems the button pres@@ ets automatically displays an odd colour . &quot;
&quot; when this option is activated , in pressing the tab@@ ulator button the appropriate number of spaces are inserted . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator sign is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press input or return , the retro@@ fitting of the previous line will also be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is activated , each selection will automatically copied from the cli@@ p@@ board . manual copy to the cli@@ p@@ board then falls . &quot;
you can select which index type you prefer to save . the pre @-@ established value is the commonly used selection of the operating system used .
&quot; when the compar@@ ing of files is trying &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines in the source files can be found . only during this first step white signs can be ignored . the second step is compar@@ ing every line . in this step white signs are not ignored . also while , white signs are not ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a wagon sign &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored a line @-@ type &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored it , but then , files with different sizes are visible , however , how a white character gets visible , however , how a white character has to be disabled . during which stit@@ uting this option has to be disabled . in the default setting this option is disabled . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis are figures and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) . in the result the differences are still indicated , but they are treated like white signs . &quot;
in the default setting this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white character .
intensi@@ vely searching for even smaller results . the option is activated in default . it is effective for complicated and large files but slowly at very large files .
&quot; in the Autom@@ atic @-@ continuing mode , this attitude determines how long the outcome of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; trig@@ gers all conflicts in white characters by selecting the selected file as a source . ( pres@@ et is useful when white signs are used in many files less important . if you only need it from time to time , use the Autom@@ atic selection also conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ign@@ oring C / C + + . &quot;
&quot; these options are treated in the chapter for scanning , folders and announ@@ cing of a compilation . look for details under documentation for the directory comparison and meeting . &quot;
&quot; if a file is saved and already existing one older version , the original version will be app@@ .@@ ori@@ g attached . if already exists such a back@@ up@@ mix with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , this will be deleted without further assurance . &quot;
fits the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you have to stop &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; end and rest@@ art so that the change is active . ( this option is set in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set to the control center there . )
&quot; the following en@@ coding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; over the selection of the coding for the coding is a short notice , what the local coding is . ( this can not be changed here and has a pure informal nature . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file @-@ coding for source files . this affects , how special characters treated and interpret . since the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared with different co @-@ coding . &quot;
&quot; when you have processed a file , you can specify exactly which coding for saving should be used . &quot;
&quot; if you define your machine commands , they could not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only be used with 8 @-@ bit ASC@@ II . ) With this option one can specify the coding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
turn off in order to supp@@ ress her@@ al@@ ments of changes in white characters in the text or viewing points . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ign@@ oring C / C + + . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences in a colour coding is displayed . however , you might just want to see the differences between two of three files . -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed with the required information next to normal mode . &quot;
sometimes you want to use the space available on the screen for long lines . blend the less important window . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu ) .
sorts the compar@@ ing window by side or another . this can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu . )
&quot; sometimes , consider the differences and then decide to split the files together . a simple click starts con@@ duction and uses the file name of the final source file as a pre @-@ issued name for output file . ( when this function is used to rest@@ art the file name again , then the name of the most recently used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first transferred to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own purchase processor , which correspond exactly to your requirements . you can use this function for example to cut out trouble @-@ cut parts or for correc@@ ting the inser@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it is given first to this external command . if also a normal pre @-@ processing command was specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only for hands @-@ processing , which corresponds to your own specifications . each entry line must have an associated issue . &quot;
&quot; the thought behind it is to allow users to gain more flexibility in setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program requires , and most users do not want to program the good news . however , the good news is however , that in most cases sed or perl fully suff@@ ice . &quot;
use this pre @-@ install@@ ment for po@@ inters like to convert all characters in large letters : sed / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; . * is a erg@@ ul@@ l@@ ary expression of the text in the first cl@@ am@@ mer@@ n@@ few . the \ \ U turns the text found in upper@@ case letter .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords for automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word Sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern ( \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header ( \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and maybe you like these regular phrases even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
the ign@@ oring of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ mach@@ ining command for po@@ inters . sed . sed / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 89.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit and each hit is replaced by nothing but practically er@@ ased .
sometimes you might want to perform several requirements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions apart from each other . for example :
instead of sed you can also use some other such as perl . perl -@@ p -@@ E &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switches &apos; aller@@ dings is required by perl some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs perl only needs ( and ) without the corresponding \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre @-@ processor is to display and hold data . further operations only change the data that can see for@@ len@@ ab@@ equal Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the len@@ tic@@ essor can see the output of normal pre @-@ percentage as input . &quot;
&quot; the processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text is altered or differences hidden , you can fail to notice certain differences in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often programmers to edit a folder of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare it with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively compare and merge . &quot;
... makes it possible to create a proposal for every object ; you can adjust the proposal before the start
... can simul@@ ate this and shows the simul@@ ated changes without it really perform ;
... runs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ;
&quot; this is similar to compar@@ ing and merge individual files very similar . you only need to open folder on the command line , or in dialog file . &quot;
&quot; when three folder is mer@@ ged , then folder is used as a base . if no target folder has been specified , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as a target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not match that together , you have to select the corresponding menu item or press the F@@ 7 button . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder you will notice a small news window above the current progress . if you break the scan of the folder , only the files are listed , which are compared to that time . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left @-@ hand side , ... &quot;
each file and each folder of which was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can choose an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together . you can double a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object , or by clicking the arrow buttons , containing all sub@@ directories with which you can catch all the folder or folders . &quot;
&quot; when you click on a file , the file will be started immediately and it will appear a compar@@ ative window . &quot;
the symbol in column name reflects the dat@@ at@@ ype in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the dat@@ at@@ ype is different in the other folder , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail@@ ing window to the selected object . in such a case , the contrac@@ tion action can not be automatically selected . if that merge together , you will be informed about problems of this type again . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , the columns A / B / C are used in red , green , yellow , and black . &quot;
&quot; identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folder are considered to be identical , if your overall content is identical . then you have the same color . with folders , the age is in@@ significant for its colour . &quot;
&quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colours of a leaf back , which is only green , then yellow , and later , when it is old , red . &quot;
... A and C are identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... A and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C not exists , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... A to have B and C not have the same dat@@ at@@ ype ( such as A a folder and B is a file ) : errors : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such incorrect objects exist , this cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B not have the same dat@@ at@@ ype ( such as A a folder and B is a file ) : errors : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such incorrect objects exist , this cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode for syn@@ cing is active , if only two folder and no explicit target folder , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action made , so that both folder are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not the same is : execute and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as the visible file name for the output file only B ; directly after the merge copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; when two files are mer@@ ged together and select the option Neu@@ ere file instead of con@@ duction , then exam@@ ines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange did not eliminate such mistakes , the folder cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; while working together a file will be processed after the other . it status column shows Fer@@ tig if that result together successfully , and according to other messages , if something Un@@ expected exp@@ ended , you should make a last check and re@@ viewing whether the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if in the field of dialog , the file method of compar@@ ative method is selected , K@@ diff@@ 3 further columns display . these contain the number of uns@@ ol@@ ved , deleted , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts will only appear when three folder are compared or assembled . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either match the currently selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the inter@@ connection steps ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can execute this . &quot;
&quot; note : if you have not indicated any target file , then in the three folder mode , you will be used as a destination using the two @-@ folder mode and sync a B and / or B as the destination . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination , please check if all entries should be displayed in the target file , also in the folder structure . there are some options to be displayed by certain entries : &quot;
to order all entries we select directory / continue in the directory -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cuts ) . to run only the current listing : select action of the current elements or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if by conf@@ lic@@ ting date types still exist , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; if you merge all entries , a dialog window will appear with the options passing , simul@@ ate and ab@@ ort . &quot;
select when you only want to see what would happen without the real changes made . you will get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge a single file ) then it opens up a composite window ( see the screens@@ hot ) .
&quot; when you are finished with a file , select fil@@ es@@ sion@@ al / continue , or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved an appropriate dialog . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on an error , a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you &apos;ll see some error messages that will help you to tick the cause of the problem or to rede@@ em the problematic entry . thus , you have the opportunity to tick a different action for entry or solve the problem in other ways before you bring together . &quot;
&quot; if some entries were individually assembled , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and leads them to later merge all entries , not again , these entries will change as settled . only if you change the merge action , these messages are again brought together . &quot;
the settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ) now has a section called directory @-@ merger with these options :
only files that are specified on the specified pattern are displayed in the sub@@ tree . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not comply with this pattern .
files and folder that correspond to this pattern will not appear in the sub@@ tree . there can be more than one pattern to be entered into the sub@@ tree : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folder that correspond to this pattern will not appear in the sub@@ tree . there can be more than one pattern to be entered into the sub@@ tree : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ m@@ atism files are ignored by CV@@ S . the major advantage is that this folder is specifically used with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see under info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems have files a provider &apos;s attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems a file marked as hidden . this option makes you choose whether these files will be displayed in the sub@@ tree or not . this option is switched in the default .
&quot; for links to files : if the option is off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched , the files will be compared to the links below . this is disabled in the default . &quot;
&quot; for links on the folder : if the option is off , the symbolic links are covered and recur@@ sively manage . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not limited to possible recur@@ ren@@ ditions . a link to a folder of a link to itself would lead to a fin@@ e@@ loop . ) This option is off in default . &quot;
&quot; introduces a complete analysis of each file by and shows the statisti@@ c columns . ( the number of detached , uns@@ ol@@ ved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and significantly slower when used to files which do not contain a text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; when you compare big folder via a slow network , it might be faster to compare only the changing date and file size . however , this speed section does not cost a certain level of safety . please use caution . this option is in default . &quot;
similar to the changing date . it does not find real comparison . the files are considered to be identical if they are equal in size . this can be useful for example if when copying the exp@@ ir@@ ation date . please use caution . this option is un@@ folded in the default .
&quot; activ@@ ates the sync mode , if two folder is compared and no target folder , the suggestions appear to merge together as well . the results of mer@@ ging files will be stored in both folders . this option is off in default . &quot;
&quot; if there is differences occurring instead of merge the copying of the newer file as action . ( this is considered uncertain , because it is assumed the knowledge that the other file has not been altered . ) This option is off in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or a folder is replaced or deleted by another folder , then it gets deleted .@@ original backup file with .@@ ori@@ g extension it will also affect the normal backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension . this also affects the normal merge single files , not only the composite folder . this option is switched in the default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder view passes merge with the mouse ; you can switch the window parts with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the window directory &amp; text window , turn into the window in the window and switch between directory &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file using double @-@ clicking menu . nevertheless , there is a single file menu , without having to merge the folder , the file will be reset , and the file will not be brought together once you start the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory once again : list &quot; &quot; menu : new &quot;
&quot; KDE supports networking with the aid of K@@ IO Sl@@ aves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folder for opening , that are on local or remote machines . &quot;
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a ft@@ p @-@ server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a com@@ pressed archive and a local folder .
a URL has a different syn@@ tax than local files and folder . a few things you should consider :
&quot; a path can be relative . or .. contain . that is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ c@@ zed . ( # - &gt; % 23 , Space - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , has a file named / # foo # the URL file : / % 23@@ foo % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used , sometimes a brief list of restrictions follows : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or a folder is displayed . then a file is accepted as a link @-@ goal . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
there is no possibility of modify cre@@ denti@@ als or change date . therefore , the permission or the change date from the original . ( note the option confidential the size . ) ( This is only available with local files . )
&quot; the main purpose for using is currently the differences in the Viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op always starts the built @-@ in distin@@ ctions . to start by diff@@ users , press the right mouse button on the same viewer , then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is applied as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . then starts at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the kon@@ quer@@ or you can select on a patch file and from the context menu preview in - K@@ ess@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if no of the original files exists . besides , this is un@@ reliable , if the original files since the patch file has changed . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ ing of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . that result or the compar@@ ing of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ deck@@ 2 ( well , there are comp@@ are ) there already . moreover , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can con@@ result like the program diff@@ use 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I use GPL @-@ programs for a long time ago and I learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or so go .
you probably have the program from the sources compiled and the configure script should not locate the right pre@@ fix to KDE . in the default inst@@ alls configure / usr / local but then KDE can find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this subject .
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are then treated as identical ; if only a non @-@ white character is differently , the line is displayed as not identical . if you next lines appear next to teach other , this time@@ is , and the case . &quot;
the editor will notice any difference in the files where he begins and where it ends . that &apos;s necessary to resolve a conflict just by clicking on the source code and selecting the button A / B / C and it is too much effort to create extra your own file format that could save this information .
&quot; the effort to do so far has been too great . you can recover a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used . &quot;
after removing text is suddenly cooled ; no sr@@ c left ; and the text does not let itself delete . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to distinguish of distinction . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missed the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer . &quot;
information you can use K@@ deck@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the latest changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the Ch@@ angel@@ og into the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to compile and install 3 , on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; KDE @-@ dir is the folder in your system , installed in KDE . if you are uns@@ ure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; as &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ aca , you should not have problems when comp@@ iling . should nonetheless encounter difficulties , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; lists of them . &quot;
cutting ( Str@@ g @-@ X or Shift @-@ removal ) copies the marked text . insert ( Str@@ g @-@ V or re@@ p @-@ inser@@ tion ) adds the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current C@@ urs@@ or@@ position and replaced the current mark@@ ings .
&quot; display differences : files which are identical in all folders , do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder . &quot;
( in the current program version you will have to re @-@ read following changes to these options to browse the folder . )
only entries are shown to show the differences . this also leads to that identical files are not already copied into the target folder . if the Target folder is not already copied into the target file . ( the behavior is likely to be copied in a later program version . ) This option is off in default .
&quot; please note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are attached to one of the buttons , the lines are attached from the appropriate window to the end of the selected group in the listing window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they are removed when clicking on the button . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is disabled . Under@@ differences in individual signs ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white character . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displays a min@@ il@@ stick of all virtual spaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ space , change their size , stop or shift them . this works both within a desktop and several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual spaces , as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within and k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and other work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse @-@ mouse is cli@@ cked , when on the empty background is set up ... and cli@@ cked . if however , the context menu has only set up the two entries P@@ ager ; and cli@@ cked , the context of the application and the name of the application , as well as the entries , maxim@@ ize , on work@@ space and filling : the commands bring the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the work@@ space . appears only when cli@@ cked on an application .
send the application to selected virtual desktop . appears only when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; this is marked by the cross@@ roads , windows can be moved within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ ings can be moved . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the name of the virtual labor force is displayed . &quot;
&quot; cross@@ roads this field makes the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of the virtual labour @-@ surfaces display . it is attached along with name , the names will be attached with or@@ bit@@ ors , eg ; 1st floor space . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also shown as background in the background . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the current programs are shown as a small window in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , otherwise , only the empty working environment will be shown to provide their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rect@@ angle with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the windows with its default symbol and pi@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window can be determined : classic &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; available in a 2x@@ n @-@ R@@ aster , as from P@@ ager applications in some other window managers , weigh@@ ed all virtual labor spaces in a so@@ k@@ right and ver@@ tically in a sen@@ k@@ right range , which is very good for the representation on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; it can be used as an alternative to P@@ ager mini program in the Control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed to the size , displaying the windows as symbols or with their content . furthermore , it works outside the control bar . &quot;
right click within and drop @-@ out ; and subsequent outputs of the switch to set up ... leaves the dialog settings appear .
&quot; at the moment , it is not possible to change in dialog settings : you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; to open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with an arbitr@@ ary text editor , like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or VI . if you don &apos;t need to register as user root or submit to your system administrator . in this file you must apply the key win@@ dow@@ ment fashion and assign values to this file . possible values are : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package c@@ base is , you need a functional installation of KDE @-@ basic packages . &quot;

&quot; display &amp; km@@ ag ; is a screens@@ hot . you can test with &amp; km@@ ag ; a part of the screen , as if you read the paper , read a magni@@ fying for the small printed or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is designed for various users : this is a full manual for the use of &amp; km@@ ag . &quot;
&quot; Vol@@ km@@ ag ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly enhanced with new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines . &quot;
&quot; when you start &amp; km@@ ag , a window appears as shown above . displays the enlarged area of the screen . below , this window appears as a magni@@ fier window .. The picture that is displayed in larger window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is shown below as a selection window . &quot;
in the default setting : enlarged &amp; km@@ ag ; the area around the mouse c@@ ursor . alternatively you can create a selected screen area in the larger window ( selection mode ) or the environment of the mouse @-@ line at the screen ( eg ; at the left side of the screen ) .
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse c@@ ursor in the enlarged window is displayed , select the mouse c@@ ursor . please note that the form of mouse c@@ ursor . at present , this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse c@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouth @-@ keys and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse @-@ hand in the larger window , and hold the left mouse button down , so you can catch the content of the enlargement window and move it . this goes also with the arrow buttons . &quot;
&quot; if you are in addition to the &amp; Shift key , press or the M@@ MB , you can move the drop @-@ down window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination you can change the size of the drop window . note that the upper left corner of the drop @-@ window will remain firm , and only the lower right corner has to be moved . &quot;
&quot; features a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , to copy a file into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to add it later into other applications ) to rot@@ ate the picture and much more . &quot;
starts or stops the update of the ad . the loading of the update causes the required CPU @-@ time against 0 .
&quot; choose the Update rate ( Very small , Ger@@ ing , Medium , H@@ och , Very High ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
in this mode a selection window will display . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&quot; display &amp; km@@ ag ; use automatically your introduc@@ ed short commands to save files , opening a new window , print , no@@ vices ( with the kno@@ b document again in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fying and res@@ ized &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; km@@ ag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screens@@ hot . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier , so as if you use a magni@@ fying glass in a newspaper or photograph . this application is for different people of use : from research or artists to web@@ designer or visual impair@@ ment . &quot;

&quot; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse c@@ ursor is a while on the same place . it is thought to help people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ strain syndrome ) and those of any mouse @-@ click pain . &quot;
&quot; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse c@@ ursor a while on the same place . it is thought to help people who em@@ ulate the repeti@@ tive strain of the jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those of any mouse @-@ click pain . besides this , it can em@@ ulate the pul@@ ling with the mouse . this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that emerg@@ es by clicking the mouse , and assi@@ sts causing so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may need to p@@ ains sor@@ eness that are connected with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not yet been done . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain reli@@ ance helps when clicking on the mouse , it is against p@@ ains that is caused by the use of the mouse , useless . and , as in all ergonomic aids , the result can vary for everyone . &quot;
the use of m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; super@@ vised your mouse movements and leads a mouse click away once you break the movement shortly .
&quot; if the mouse is activated , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it will perform the mouse button . in this way you can execute the mouse button . in this way you can execute the pul@@ ling with penet@@ rated mouse button . in this way you can move the pul@@ ling with penet@@ rated button . the intelligent rel@@ oc@@ ating requires a little practice , but you get used quickly . &quot;
&quot; this per@@ for@@ ting time must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse @-@ click . &quot;
&quot; Intel@@ ligent rel@@ oc@@ ating is enabled , the turning time is enabled ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here the time is set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after down the mouse @-@ mouse is waiting before it lets the mouse again get rid of the mouse again , if there is no doubt of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the Click with mouse shift . this feature is now enabled , a slow motion to the right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow motion to the left and back leads a double @-@ click . this moves will be started at the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , but can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is del@@ ayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; to move the reaction time ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose a sound system and here the rider General . there &apos;s a sli@@ der sound buff@@ ers that you adjust to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting marks this setting , is now displayed &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . with GNO@@ ME or other window environments , please drop the respective documentation to find out how you start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; sets all the settings back to the values that were set in opening dialogue . have you already pushed the button on the button , the settings will be put into effect after the last pressures of the dialog . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; initially with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the intelligent remedy should let you first look off . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later increase the intelligent rel@@ oc@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce response times by &amp; k@@ de ; to l@@ essen the sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should consciously make yourself aware of which places a mouse @-@ click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that doesn &apos;t make a link , does not park to un@@ figured reactions . you can park the mouse at such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse ru@@ ck@@ le , you should clean your mouse . it is usually quite simple . the trick is that you can not just clean@@ se the mouse ball , but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to find the mouse ball . as this happens , from mouse to mouse , however , it should be clear however , if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you &apos;d need to see the roles . these are located at the sides of the hole in which the bul@@ let was used . the dirt and the dirt can easily be used with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el squ@@ ab@@ ble . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just begun a postpon@@ ement , meaning that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool means that this operation is no longer termin@@ ated by the slogan of the mouse . &quot;
this happens when you are &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using another window manager and shift a window .
&quot; the solution to this problem is that you can execute a mouse @-@ click . this is reset , the status of t@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can work as usual . &quot;
problem : if you enter text is trying to execute text &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; furthermore mouse clicks and sets the c@@ ursor to another place .
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the c@@ ursor into it , where you want to place it . however , you can park the mouse on a neutral area of work space , if you want to result in excess weight because of the mouse clicks . safe zones for the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor . safe zones for the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor . safe zones for the mouse c@@ ursor and menus and the head@@ lines from windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent moving , but I managed not to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent rel@@ oc@@ ating is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time , before you want to deal with it . it is very well possible to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and want to re @-@ paste it again , but it will likely be ready to get problems with you . here are some advice to them : &quot;
&quot; use the smart rel@@ oc@@ ating not , if you just begin to use the km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; select text instead following the mouse button , while you move the mouse button down while you move the mouse into the other end of the text , and again the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this way , every@@ time when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse presses a sound like a mouse click . so , you know exactly when the intelligent rel@@ oc@@ ating the shooting @-@ time starts . later you can use the intelligent rel@@ oc@@ ating even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , this requires some exercise . &quot;
to be able to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to install the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system features a sound card and speakers and are correctly furnished .
&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; Oper@@ ated the mouse once as soon as the mouse c@@ ursor in short . this program was developed for people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome and which the actu@@ ation of the Mau@@ sta@@ est pain is already prepared .
&quot; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a pul@@ ling process begins , before the mouse is left . in this way the pul@@ ling and flow with the mouse can be performed . &quot;

&amp; km@@ outh ; is a program with the mu@@ te user let their computer can speak for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; km@@ outh , you can let the computer let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list of the talk to propositions which should be discussed again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( lin@@ kes screens@@ hot ) you enter the command , which is later used for the text output of text . further details can be found in the description of the panel . &quot;
&quot; on the second page you choose the default file system . you can often choose the appropriate text application , without having to type them . the text specifications can be processed naturally . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screens@@ hot ) you determine the dictionary for the vocabulary . &amp; km@@ outh , reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can get the word@@ list with an Open@@ Office.@@ org @-@ dictionary . in addition , you can start the words associated with a Open@@ Office.@@ org @-@ dictionary . &quot;
the main window of the km@@ outh ; is clearly arranged and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard goods of your propositions ( the lower white field in the screens@@ hot ) and a sl@@ course of the already spoken sets ( the top white field in the screens@@ hot ) .
&quot; if you choose km@@ outh , you can enter the input field the propositions you want to listen . every promised sentence is attached to the course of memory . you can choose from these propositions which are to be discussed again . &quot;
&quot; the menu entry features km@@ outh , set up ... open the setup of dialog by &amp; km@@ outh . this dialog contains two cart@@ on cards , voice @-@ over@@ s and settings , the page Wor@@ ker and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the cart@@ el map , enter the command for the call of language @-@ generator . in the selection field below the input field you specify the text en@@ coding fixed , with the text to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ outh , knows two ways to pass the text . select the cross @-@ field if the text is to be passed on as default to the language generator as default . &quot;
&quot; if the cross area is not selected , the text is passed on as parameter . you can use the following wild@@ card : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command can be used to address your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; with as desktop service as a language service , the km@@ outh is used as the first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that &apos;s successful , the additional settings is available on this page and which is currently enhanced in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection period following the selection of a text box you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cuts or through the choice of a text box in the menu text@@ menu , or in the bar for appropriate text books . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of so@@ fort , the selected text box will be sent directly and additionally added to the connection memory . with the selection of In the input field the selected text box will only be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection panel of the editing p@@ endant , you can specify , whether the text@@ box manual should be saved automatically when closing the editing p@@ ane . &quot;
&quot; when selecting the text@@ data file , the book is stored . if you choose changes , the textbook for appropriate request will not be saved . ask for stor@@ ing , becomes &amp; km@@ outh , ask if the appropriate textbook . &quot;
&quot; the page Wor@@ re@@ ation contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the completion . in the main window , next to the input field displays &amp; km@@ outh ; a selection field , if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this sel@@ ections , you can choose the currently used dictionary for vocabulary . &quot;
&quot; using the buttons on the right side , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of the books or ex@@ porting them into a file . below the list you can set the name and select the language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; choose for this source the desired language ; &amp; km@@ outh , reads the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation , reads the frequency of each word . additionally , you can compare the words list with an Open@@ Office.@@ org @-@ dictionary , in order to include only correct words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; this option allows you to combine the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; km@@ outh , then asks what dic@@ tion@@ aries are brought together , and how this weight@@ ed shall be . &quot;
&quot; with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries to . da &amp; km@@ outh ; new incorporated words automatically adds into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary across the time . &quot;
the main range of the window for the processing of text @-@ pass@@ codes is divided . in the upper part the texts are presented as a tree @-@ structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit an selected entry . if you have selected a text box , you can change the text box or the associated short@@ list , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions like new text messages or books , or remove selected text passages and books you can either reach using the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text @-@ pass@@ codes or pic@@ kl@@ ages may change you by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new place , or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is cut off and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected fields of the course @-@ storage . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected fields of the course store . &quot;
&quot; the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is located in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected propositions of the course of store . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a movable tool@@ bar is indicated with buttons for frequently used commands . by mouse @-@ click on the sc@@ ram@@ ming left side and pul@@ ling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow bar in the lower part of the main window with hints on the condition of the km@@ outh ; displayed when not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a mo@@ ve@@ able glue for text lists are indicated under the tool@@ bar . by mouse @-@ click on the sc@@ ram@@ ming left side and pul@@ ling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
probably you have the command for the voice @-@ over@@ s not correct or not completely entered . open settings km@@ outh ; open the page of General settings and enter the command for voice issue on the map language edition . ( see introduc@@ tory dialog for voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers for more details . )
&quot; Festival is a language @-@ over@@ s system of the University Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh is currently supported . the license allows to use the festival for free and without any restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , is accepted that the festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to voice @-@ over@@ s is then : &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a simple language generator . currently , it only supports the English language . the license allows it to use Free@@ T@@ TS free for free and without any restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for the establishment of the voice output , it is accepted that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et . language edition is then possible with one of the three following commands examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must send data as default output . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of Ph@@ on@@ emen into a Wav@@ ep@@ at@@ ei so you need an additional program to dis@@ integrate the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free of non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
&quot; in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assum@@ ing that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax liked the last character of the text , so an additional sign must be app@@ ends . the full command is therefore more elaborate as in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ F _ usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
&quot; all parts of the command must be written into one line , the option data must be switched as default . &quot;
the F@@ TT @-@ D@@ äm@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service that is available to all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications are enhanced in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language @-@ over@@ s systems .
&quot; since the setting of language @-@ generator occurs only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as desktop service as a language service in &amp; km@@ outh . &quot;
&quot; for setting , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service that appears in the introduc@@ tory dialog by &amp; km@@ outh ; appears if K@@ TT@@ SD has been installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ outh ; successfully to use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; km@@ outh ; needs about 15 MB storage ( and in addition memory for the language generator ) , but it depends in detail from your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; km@@ outh : is an application , with the people who can not speak to leave text by the computer . there is a list already being saved by the computer , which the user can always pay new again . &quot;
note that &amp; km@@ outh ; no language syn@@ thesizer involves . on the computer a language syn@@ thesizer has to be installed .

&amp; kt@@ am ; - the F@@ IL system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a single modules of existing service that allows each application to read text about the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface .
&amp; kt@@ on ; is a part system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice @-@ over@@ s ( T@@ TS ) . it presents a common usage centre for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ programmer ready to use their applications with T@@ TS @-@ abilities . also users provides interesting options .
&quot; reading of texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; Kate ; , even if &amp; Kate ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications is embedded . &quot;
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s is done via the program Spe@@ ech D@@ isp@@ at@@ cher , the various background program like es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows the creation of language extensions on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) about the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ auxiliary program .

a module for the web browser and kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
&quot; a module for the text editor &amp; Kate ; , with which a text file can be read or partially read . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( http : / / bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find discussions on https : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ accessibility . the developers can also be found at IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ accessibility ) . &quot;
&quot; before you can use , you must install program Spe@@ ech D@@ isp@@ at@@ cher and set properly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no spokes@@ person are set up , the map ticket speaker is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card card is posted . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS syn@@ thesi@@ zers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or such that is called for volume , syn@@ thesizer , voice , gender , volume and speed is used as a speaker . you should at least use a speaker before you are used as the program speed D@@ isp@@ at@@ cher else the default speaker . &quot;
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer can be comparable with multiple pressure tests for the same printer .
&quot; when you click on the cardboard box rec@@ tory speaker in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ GR , the cardboard card does show display . this appears also automatically when you start t@@ table and still no speaker . &quot;
all already furnished spokes@@ man appear in this list . the favor@@ ed speaker appear on top of the list . the top speakers will be used for voice @-@ over@@ s when an application does not exist .
&quot; click with a mouse click on a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; click with a mouse click on a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with one mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speaker in the list is also determined by their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running time ; to apply .
&quot; choose a single type of type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a Jun@@ gen@@ - and maid @-@ voice to choose from . &quot;
&quot; when you click here , appears on the new speaker at the cart@@ on map . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can select &amp; kt@@ on ; as soon as you use . go back to Anti@@ trust map correctly and check if the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; start . now , you can download it to make text read . click on the map ticket orders to create and manage text files . see . &quot;
&quot; if you have arranged at least one speaker , you can choose the language system of &amp; k@@ de ; click on the box card to open this card card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; select this tick @-@ field to enable the image system ; this starts the KDE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this start is successful , the card card will start and read text files . see . remove the mark@@ ings , K@@ TT@@ SD , and the T@@ TS @-@ System of &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is finished , running &amp; kt@@ on ; further , provided the box is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is crossed . &quot;
&quot; marks this cross@@ road marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ GR automatically appears in the system range of the Control bar , it disappears again as soon as the pre @-@ read is completed . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can start text entries , stop and resume . &quot;
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; read the cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also change the subject for an order .
&quot; click apply or OK , then all changed settings on all pages are adopted . &quot;
&quot; the map orders will only be shown when K@@ TT@@ SD was launched . to start by K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the cardboard box and select the K@@ TT@@ SD card ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; you can first read the text of the displayed website . just highlight the text that is to be read , and select in the main menu Tools text pre @-@ read . after a short time the voice should start . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s almost always useful to highlight the desired text of a website . you can ski@@ p this step too , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ foot@@ er and other invisible brands are also read as well . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can first read text . then check the text that is to be read and select in the main menu Tools text . then select the text output . &quot;
&quot; this also works , if &amp; Kate is embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ; &quot;
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the manual system of &amp; k@@ de , which you will notify you of the events that you are determined by you . you can read the text of this news from time to time . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; conversation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can establish different types of messages , for example , that you can notify you when in an IR@@ C channel a message emerg@@ es , in which your nickname occurs . with &amp; kt@@ on ; you can then read the IR@@ C new@@ s.de . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu item notification in the menu settings of this program . the potential settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; filters to assem@@ bling the drawing board offer a good possibility to correct the file ; wrong or failed to correct the file , this is a good example . you remo@@ ves the tags and b from the news , the mail address , as this can be assumed the word / local / in@@ box as this can be adopted in most cases than provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of t@@ kt@@ on ; for normal working with &amp; kt@@ on ; filters are not required .
&quot; in Fil@@ ters , text is edited , before he sent to the Spe@@ ech D@@ isp@@ at@@ cher . you are useful for improvement of pr@@ on@@ unci@@ ation to select wrong words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to handle certain shortcomings of language syn@@ thesi@@ zers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; sp@@ ech D@@ isp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ on ; differs four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the issue of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it will be submitted to all other orders and keeps these orders submitted . if the issue of screen readers are read , the given orders will be continued . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved at hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and usual text . these contracts will be continued after the issue of warning .
&quot; News have the nearest priority . a message break down normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of an application , the news used . while you can read a long text on a website , you can join with &amp; km@@ outh , who just enter the room . &amp; k@@ de ; messages are also news . read it . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text@@ orders . each order that you request from the card card orders , is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text applications are intended for issu@@ ing longer texts , which have no particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four boxes will be processed in queue , except the output of screen readers . if an application will send the output of a screen reader , while giving an application , this issue will be raised and ended . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filters never be applied to the issue of screen readers . you are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text files , as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages . &quot;
filters Edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . at the moment there are three types of filters .
filters are run as modules . in future it can still be further types of filters .
strings Ret@@ ur@@ ring parts of a text by other text . the con@@ fl@@ ing parts can be delivered either as words or as regular expressions . it is provided with pre @-@ defined drawing packages ( e.g. : - ) by text or for the re @-@ format of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better comprehen@@ sible form possible .
&amp; XML ; -@@ trans@@ former use a X@@ SLT @-@ file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in delivery of &amp; XHTML ; are some X@@ SLT files for translation of &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; by intercom fil@@ ters , you can send contracts depending on the contents of the text or on the program that sent the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to an speaker . if you are given for example on the map ticket spokes@@ man for a female voice , you can read text by KDE @-@ messages about it . read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable par@@ able rules , according to which he is applied to a voice @-@ over@@ s . when the filter establishes itself that its rules does not exist , there is the text left the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text contract is sent , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification of results , it is edited through all activated filters on the bottom , processed by the filters in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this displays the list of fully furnished normal filters . if a filter is not enabled , it is not enabled and won &apos;t be used . filter will be processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and you will see the below below . &quot;
&quot; for the setting up of strings , you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as compar@@ ative pattern . these patterns will be modified in the text , then the text will be exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . big and small @-@ mail is not observed when comparison . &quot;
&quot; specify a name for your filters . this name allows you to choose any number , it must only be different from the names of the other filters . &quot;
&quot; this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column , and replaced it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is shown in the indicated order from top to bottom . &quot;
click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; using these buttons , you can upload a list of words or regular expressions from a file to store the current list or delete . download a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; if the filter is registered here , the filter is applied only if the spokes@@ person for the text entry is one of the languages listed here . you can also select multiple languages if you click the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ key pressed . &quot;
&quot; if the filter is registered here , the filter is used only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by com@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
the application ID run programs will be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Num@@ bers you have to leave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the applic@@ ator ID Cop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 is to be allowed to enter only copy .
&quot; the drawing conveyor belts will only be applied to the text when all conditions are applied with an entry in box type . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all the texts . &quot;
when compared to words the character introduces the drawing load simul@@ ations in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by divi@@ ding characters ( Space ) .
&quot; in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ulations , you can call it in the di@@ alogs or mach@@ ining as help to assem@@ bling these expressions , you can find it in the di@@ alogs and # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ trans@@ duc@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SLT files from a format to another format . X@@ SLT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such revers@@ als . it can only be applied to well @-@ shaped XML . the manual program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H also reaches x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; with the speaker op@@ tionally , you can send texts to a specific subject , which is arranged on the cart@@ on board , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can for example set that texts from k@@ mail should be read by a feminine voice . &quot;
&quot; before asking a text to the filters , there is a spokes@@ man for the text . the speaker is subject to the text . the speaker is selected to send the text on board ; send , and the characteristics of the cart@@ on ticket speaker selected . with the speaker optional filter you can write the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is applied here , in case the text contains the given regular expression . it is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions , you can call this with a click on the button to get help with the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the start of the drawing chain , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; place here the properties of the desired intercom function . if the text shown the above filter@@ conditions , the speaker will be selected to indicate the desired requirements most frequently . click on the button to view the dialog selection . &quot;
use this buttons to store or load your speaker settings or delete all settings .
&quot; the intercom filter is applied only to the text , when all conditions apply with an entry in box to apply filters when applicable . you need to apply at least one condition . &quot;
&quot; the langu@@ ag API , from &amp; k@@ de ; to lend the programmers to lend their applications T@@ TS @-@ abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD across &amp; D@@ Bus . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module , with which language syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &apos;s syn@@ thesi@@ zers can use this syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the voice @-@ output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

&quot; I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Um@@ forming filter , but by using the Modu@@ ls for festival websites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male UK ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able does not work , so if you do not use this voice for reading our web site . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c was installed and to find on the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation appear to cause errors in syn@@ thesizer , so whole movements will ski@@ pped over or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure the option Dra@@ en@@ coding is adjusted to the correct language used for the appropriate language . are there problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a string kett@@ ener@@ ator filter . see . &quot;

&quot; the &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech D@@ isp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ am ; for the use of another syn@@ thesi@@ zers , please contact the team team . &quot;
&quot; the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used to support SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filters , but is not necessarily necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; to compile &amp; kt@@ ops ; to compile , you need a current development environment of KDE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech D@@ isp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you obtain the source text from the source code , from source file archive or have downloaded the tar@@ ball for each night , then install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use , check first , whether Spe@@ ech D@@ isp@@ at@@ cher is working properly with your language syn@@ thesi@@ zers . you can use the Shell@@ tran@@ script SPD @-@ conf . &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of the tables that uses the Spe@@ ech D@@ isp@@ at@@ cher . the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is designed to be developed directly and the script SPD file is no longer needed .
&quot; a long text is dis@@ assembled in single phrases . the user can withdraw from or set forth , repeat the output or ab@@ ort . &quot;
&quot; if an application provides text on board ; moreover , it can provide an application for example a female English speaker . if you choose a speaker , whose language English and whose gender is feminine , this is otherwise automatically the best suited speaker . if you want to learn more about how to choose a speaker , you see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the cardboard map speaker , then click on a speaker to the list or click Edit , the card controller is shown . as an example , the establishment of the module for festival Interactive is shown . details on the modules can be found here . &quot;
type the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival in P@@ AT@@ H is included , you only need to enter festival . &quot;
&quot; select the coding coding for text , which is handed over to the festival . in case of voices that are made to the festival , this setting will be automatically performed . generally , that Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 use , eastern languages like Czech or Slov@@ ak to use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; these sli@@ ders make you volume , talk speed and cl@@ ue of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some Reg@@ ul@@ ators and display this grey , the voice you have chosen will not be able to select these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded on account of their size . if you mark this mixing field , these voices are already loaded with the launch of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( in large storage ) the first set is syn@@ thesi@@ zed by the first sentence . &quot;
&quot; if this cross@@ road cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forget to apply ) . &quot;
&quot; marks this cross@@ road marked with the launch of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the window window table . otherwise , after starting , only the icon t@@ table in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this cross@@ road marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is not running out , appears in the system area once K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . thereby , you have the opportunity to read the pre @-@ read or otherwise control it . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders listed in queue , along with the application that has hired the order , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the currently mach@@ ined proposition . the speaker ID will correspond to the column ID on the card board speaker . &quot;
with the buttons in this series you can proceed in the order that is selected in the list below or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) .
&quot; by clicking on OK , all changes of settings ( also transferred to the other cart@@ on cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr becomes a symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to show the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here , only text entries are listed and managed . there are issues of screen instructions , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . for more information on the materials types of products , you will find in . &quot;
&quot; choose the type of audio @-@ output here . if a component can not be selected , the table was compiled , either without support for the appropriate audio module or desktop ; the necessary libraries can not load . &quot;
&quot; when G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you have to choose at least one module , select the PC@@ M device . &quot;
&quot; Set the intercom speed here . 50 &amp; nbsp ; % equivalent to about half an hour @-@ free ; % approximately the double normal talk speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program needs to be installed . &quot;
click on to apply the new settings for the running system ; -@@ System to take over .
&quot; the list of AL@@ SA devices contains all PC@@ M devices and modules that are installed in your system . most of them will not work . you will have to find out which device works with you , in doubt you choose standard . &quot;
&quot; on this map , you can set special actions that will always be executed when the text contract is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
the issue of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it will be submitted to all other orders and keeps these orders submitted . after the issue of the screen reader has been read , the resum@@ ed orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
war@@ nings have priority priority . this stage is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved at hot . a warning keeps the issue of messages and usual text . these contracts will continue after the warning of the warning .
&quot; News have the next priority . a message break down normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of an application , the news speaks . if you are a long text on a website , you can welcome with &amp; km@@ outh ; nevertheless someone welcome the room just steps . &quot;
&quot; will be inter@@ rup@@ ting a text message by a message , warning or the issue of a screen reader , app@@ ends the audio @-@ output into the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played , when a normal text @-@ contract is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound is active as well as introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this map are only applicable for normal texts applications . for messages , war@@ nings and the issues of screen instructions , there are no special actions if this will be interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ on ; make posting news pre @-@ read , start t@@ sm@@ oul@@ try and click aler@@ ts . the box card noti@@ fications appears . &quot;

&quot; this stance is marked , announ@@ cements that a sound is dis@@ played , from &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; in which you want to select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , sent &amp; conversation , if anyone mentioned in an IR@@ C message of your nickname . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which in the list is nothing else indicated , are ignored by time ; ignored . &quot;
&quot; use this selection field to define what &amp; kt@@ ts , do when an event arrives . you have the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you choose to select text pre @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following wild@@ card : &quot;
&quot; you can enter the properties of the desired speaker . default , select the speaker , who is displayed in the list on the map spokes@@ person as top listing . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . is specified for a certain event of a specific application , this will be executed . otherwise , the action for all other events of the particular application is executed . as a last chance the action is set for wearing , which are defined under standard ( all other events ) . &quot;

&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for a voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , the volume speed , the volume of the voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard . &quot;
currently it is provided that SS@@ ML is only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , as this is the default , the festival is used in the issue of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or sound system in the Festival &apos;s configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ bs ; % is adjusted , the SS@@ ML text is usually stated very mon@@ ot@@ on . &quot;
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ coding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE / TR / Spe@@ ech @-@ Syn@@ thesis / Syn@@ th@@ es@@ is@@ .@@ dt@@ d &quot; &gt; Who has slept in my bed ? asked Matthew B@@ är . wonder@@ ed the Bär@@ en@@ kind . &#93; &#93; &gt;
&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation characteristics ( SD@@ S @-@ Filter ) . SB@@ Ds under@@ divide text into individual phrases . thus , the first set of text must be syn@@ thesi@@ zed unless the first sentence is syn@@ thesi@@ zed or stop or stop and ab@@ rupt , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not directly support this . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the typ@@ ing of bor@@ der@@ berry filter . at the first start of the table , it is automatically set up a pro@@ posi@@ tional definition filter automatically . you can change its settings or add a further pun@@ ishing attachment filter , but it will be distr@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; the easiest option is to learn how to try out the speech selection and select text for pres@@ enter . turn the speech option again , change some features and check how the selection of speaker is changing . of course you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; then faster with the pre @-@ reading can begin , because only the first sentence has to be processed and not the full text block , which can last very long . &quot;
&quot; they will then hold orders on the card &apos;s map orders or v@@ om@@ iting , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal typ@@ es@@ sm@@ elling filter is automatically set up if you start t@@ sm@@ t@@ sm@@ s for the first time . it cannot be switched off , just change nothing about this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
typ@@ ing bor@@ der@@ filters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional and add a t@@ ul@@ ator ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional boundaries ( tab is automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default stat@@ us@@ tion filter does not retain the default file .
&quot; S@@ BD @-@ Filter are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( k@@ ick@@ ed ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of screen readers . &quot;
&quot; if you are from Ver@@ don &apos;t see the normal typ@@ ing trainer filters , you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c . &quot;
on the cart@@ on board sel@@ ector you can write the speech settings for the application . the card card is displayed when
use of the default disk ( the top one on the cart@@ on board ) . in other words : no speech properties are specified .
&quot; if you do not delete or edit the appropriate speaker manufacturer , who does not delete or edit the settings of the speaker . if you choose the settings of the speaker , select &amp; dict@@ ates ; this spokes@@ man does not choose the subject , the most common qualities . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the desired speaker . if this property does not play a role , do not give anything . &quot;
&quot; select this tick @-@ field , if the property should have priority prior to other properties . you can also set up several mark@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; since the language is a critical factor when adjust@@ ing the output , it is always used as a priority property . the only case , where you possibly want to specify the attribute you may want , if you know that a certain application text is sent in another language other than that in the work environment . &quot;
&quot; use all the properties in the field of speaker , which are listed on the listed below , click on the Options controller and then use on speaker , which is listed on the listed below . &quot;
in this case 0 for the last text contract in queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number is input 0 required ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ ash cr@@ ashing immediately when it is started . I have de@@ bug support but I do not receive back tracking .
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is cr@@ ashed and pun@@ ctu@@ ated ; probably you must register G@@ stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , it is perhaps a not compatible version of G@@ aff@@ amer . you can try to update or un@@ install G@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio @-@ over@@ s about AL@@ SA does not work when I stop using another application music . if I stop a text script , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ on ; one . on the &amp; console ; appears a message that says : &quot; to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system there is the problem that conflicts arise at AL@@ SA who can prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . information for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) , at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ project@@ .@@ org. &quot;
&quot; I loaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I installed it and can use them in the festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; add to the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / festival@@ int / ? as a guide you can send a patch along with the &amp; URL , where you found the voice to the developer . &quot;
&quot; on the cart@@ on board audio there is an adjustment speed . so this works , the program should be installed so@@ x and can be fin@@ dable about the ambient game features such as Festival Interactive . depending on the selected voice , this works is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the talk speed will be ignored if the template is transm@@ uted ; SS@@ ML has its own tags , with which the speed is controlled ( see ) or , if you are completely cour@@ ageous , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML series @-@ filters , and set the intercom speed . &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t make it to be read that web pages are read with a female voice . I have prepared a feminine festival spokes@@ person , but on display the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
at the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . this festival does not produce errors in order to convert the x@@ s@@ l file to converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to VO@@ ICE tags .
&quot; I have added a custom drawing facility filters and now I can set in bed ; no longer through@@ put forward , or go back . on the cart@@ els orders is displayed , the order is not just one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; point of pun@@ ctu@@ ation ( point , question mark , comm@@ uter , and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) , you are not allowed to filter . use this sign a filter for the pro@@ posi@@ tional detection . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is already installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ project@@ .org )

&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio @-@ channel . if your system counts , you can not simultaneously play music and let a text read , and then start a text . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with July 2005 a@@ Ko@@ en does not support a real break . if you hold a text application in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set is still being read . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for general adjustment of the intercom speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included in most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs already included . &quot;
have you downloaded &amp; kt@@ on ; as tar@@ ball ( with t@@ ar ge@@ pack@@ er archive ) you can sign up as a normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . change to this folder and enter the following commands :

&quot; before you use , review , first check if your language syn@@ thesizer has been working properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the votes is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you can tone volume , talk speed and pitch @-@ height . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . help in the instructions , which are supplied with festival . would you like to read pages , you need to install the ( male UK ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you must compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on transmission . &quot;
&quot; this voice requires Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or new ahead . the voice is still in an early stage stage . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / Russian / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the votes ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ril@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit@@ - ) coding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux , distribution distri@@ butions . look for festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the coding of ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 must be adjusted . &quot;
if you want to use the Russian voice the option must be adjusted to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ril@@ lic such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; syn@@ thesi@@ zers . then the Festival takes over the l@@ ex@@ ic analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; this produces the audio @-@ output . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ program and the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; no full language system is generated . &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; generates language of Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to generate this di@@ phone . t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German texts Di@@ phone . more information can be found here .
&quot; with this method , additional W@@ rap@@ per Code is added to the Festival to use &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voice to voice synthesis . please note that the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ pac@@ ed files are not in the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ folder installed , but in the folder @-@ lib / lib . &quot;

&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; a module for the &amp; k@@ monitor center ; that allows the management of network interfaces , routine and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a set of system and desktop controls over a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ monitor center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ monitor . &quot;
this &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ monitor center ; create the ranges of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the following tasks :
after installation a new module settings in the &amp; k@@ monitor center ; displayed . the module settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting the contro@@ l@@ center ; internet &amp; network settings in the &amp; menu menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install properly . physical devices and their drivers have to be installed and configured so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and setting the network properties .
&quot; in most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed at the Inst@@ alling of &amp; Linux , installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers will need to be loaded by adapting files , according to the core version , load : &quot;
&quot; the module settings will be loaded when the option settings is selected in the &amp; k@@ monitor center ; -@@ index is selected . when starting the module settings , this system attempts to automatically recognize the platform at the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the chosen selection is offered . it is the platform from the list , which matches the distribution and the release of releas@@ ing the best . by selecting the default settings , the setting will be made permanently . the next start of net@@ settings will then be automatically set . &quot;
changing the changing settings is possible only in system administration mode . before all options are gray as well what does the settings can only be considered that change is not possible . in the system administration mode . it is necessary to enter the password mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
&quot; in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three riders : &quot;
&quot; the tab interface is used to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the rider interfaces , the following tasks can be performed : &quot;
you can set up the current network interfaces through selection of the desired device in the list and click the button interface ... in dialog device .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click on the button &quot; &quot; Advanced settings &quot; &quot; displays the dialog with further possibilities . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of Autom@@ atic , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched by an DH@@ CP @-@ server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in the automatic mode , the TCP / IP information is required for each system start . in the selection list can either be selected ( DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP ) according to the system , selected . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Manu@@ ell can be performed without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field , IP @-@ address must be specified the sub@@ network mask . &quot;
&quot; this setting marks this setting , initi@@ alizes the system interface with boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values given in this dialog are displayed as qualities of the device .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off on demand , and turn off on a activated network system by selecting from the list and request from the interface .... &quot;
&quot; network devices can either be activated or switched off on demand , and turn off a activated network device by selecting from the list and instructions on the interface .... &quot;
&quot; sets the IP @-@ address of the computer in the local sub@@ network , which provides the physical connection to remote networks and is currently used by default for TCP / IP communication with machines . &quot;
&quot; if the computer exists more than one network interface , the interface must be selected to the net in which the Gateway computer is selected . &quot;
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain property by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers only use IP addresses . when the computer ur@@ ges the name to an IP address like 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator to the nam@@ ental is possible for a simple administration of this list . entries can be added to or changed wer@@ .@@ DNS items can be ordered by selecting a entries and execution or dem@@ otion in the list with the buttons or herds in the priority .
&quot; by clicking the button &quot; &quot; Add ... &quot; &quot; from the group machine to the nam@@ ental solution , a DNS server can be added . it will add the dialog to new nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button &quot; &quot; Add &quot; . &quot; the entry then is included in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group machine to the nam@@ ental solution , select an entry and then click on the button &apos; Edit ... It will be shown as a dialog . &quot;
&quot; the list of known calcul@@ ator describes calcul@@ ator name @-@ to @-@ IP address for TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used with boats when no DNS server is available . in small , connected networks it can replace DNS server . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list of known calcul@@ ators provide some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . these are still in the test well @-@ being version of IP should replace in the future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP @-@ address of the known host and click &quot; Add ... The dialog &quot; New Ali@@ as &quot; will be displayed .
&quot; insert the name of the known calcul@@ ator and click the &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; button . if the familiar host has several alias names , the button &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; and the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of a known host from the list and select Edit .... The dialog friend is displayed .
&quot; it can be done one of the following tasks , then clicking on OK the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings that are made in the module settings are effective immediately . to activate the changes , must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net to download the latest version of your source .
&quot; for installation of binary distribution distri@@ butions ( usually r@@ pm @-@ packages ) it is enough , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed . &quot;
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the r@@ pm package and in a &amp; console ; with r@@ pm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphic interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool for your distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient , but in addition , the development packages with libraries and other things will be needed . &quot;
&quot; this will be recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to compile . the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information is given about basic network technology , in the second are all discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; altered configuration files are discussed . &quot;
&quot; this area can not replace an additional knowledge of IP @-@ networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the inclusion of the PC is transferred into a small ( home ) network . &quot;
&quot; currently , IP @-@ networks with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) has never been found . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never seen wide spread . from IP@@ v@@ 6 , this description is therefore currently focusing on the spread IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge that IP address is assign to a network interface . in foreign networks , on the bed ; workplace is the contact user interface , which is a valid IP address , if available , the IP address can not be easily chosen arbitr@@ arily . &quot;
&quot; when placing an own small ( home ) network , the IP @-@ address should be chosen specifically for this purpose in order to avoid IP address with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded on the Internet , so it is possible to use any use . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be made possible by setting up a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
for smaller networks mostly addresses in the area of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 is used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually placed on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all machines can be in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back @-@ address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . &quot;
&quot; the AC 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine . usually , the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this part , the configuration files are stored by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes dynamic with DSL connection , so that it is not surprising when in case of active DSL connection to another content being specified there . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; is known that this file is sorted by the scripts used in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&quot; soldier ; is a backup program for dis@@ continued pieces on the basis of t@@ ar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first objective was to provide a surface for t@@ ar , which offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ t@@ ar to fast , sel@@ ective un@@ pack . the second goal was to answer a question that is my wife : how much longer takes it when you secure ? &quot;
before a tape can be used it must be involved by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done on three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; sp@@ ells the band back and reads the for@@ elo@@ ad of the ban@@ des . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the sign on the tape does not know if the band is to be form@@ att@@ ed .
&quot; det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the Pre @-@ ann , searches for the appropriate index on your record . can this not be found , you will be asked if the band@@ index is created new . &quot;
&quot; everything has gone smoothly , the symbol for the belt process is to indicate that the band has been incorporated . in the status bar appears a corresponding message . the content of the strip can now be brow@@ sed by the cover of the entry for the band . &quot;
&quot; prior to throwing the belt , first must first be resolved . there are three methods to achieve this : &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat : gives a change of symbols for the band to recognize that integration for the band has been solved and displays a message in the status bar . the band can now be turned out without risk .
before a band can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be dated &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ att@@ ed .
&quot; a band@@ width has to be form@@ att@@ ed before you can be used to save data . this process does not correspond to the form@@ atting at &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not correspond to the form@@ atting when it has to be form@@ att@@ ed before you use by the band of &amp; k@@ dat ; fl@@ ppy @-@ belt cells normally use a form@@ atting of the tape , DAT drives . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band@@ name and the capacity runs &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the belt , the band is automatically integrated into the band . after completing the formation process , the band is automatically integrated and ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you come across the backup process , you have to select the most secure files . this can be done on three ways : &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in the local file tree . it is only stored in this file , or the folder . &quot;
highlight a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in profile are backed up .
highlight files in a local file tree with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ directories are secured .
right click on the local file tree and select in the menu ...
&quot; once the backup is introduced , the dialog will open up settings for the backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for the backup . &quot;
&quot; once you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will be secure . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
highlight a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder is tested .
highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . only the marked files and / or sub@@ directories are tested .
right click on one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
&quot; once the test process was started , the dialog settings for review . in this dialog you can even check your selection and change the work record for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog will be shown . this dialog will show the progress of the test process as well as the data set and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can manage to re @-@ establish the files , the files that are to be restored , this can be done on two ways : &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in one of the Archive , which belong to the entry for the band@@ cycle . it is restored only the selected file or sub@@ folder . &quot;
highlight the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ directories are recovered .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select recovery in the menu ....
&quot; as soon as the recovery process has been launched , the dialog settings for recovery . in this dialog , you can even check your selection and change the work record for restoration . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog will be released . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data set and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , it proves to be new to create the band@@ inde@@ er file according to the band@@ content . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of belt : &quot;
&quot; in this way , a backup profile will be created with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can use the following settings for a backup profile : &quot;
&quot; the current employment folder in which the backup should be made . the list of adult files will be automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder . &quot;
&quot; for all folders , which are listed under backup files , that only the files are stored in the same file system as the folder . folders , which are located on other fil@@ es@@ ystems , you can separate separately under backup files . each entry is viewed independently of the others . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last in@@ creative backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files saved , which have since changed since . &quot;
&quot; the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last in@@ creative backup . &quot;
delet@@ es the snap@@ shots file before the call of t@@ ar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; lt ; files was not yet implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings at the menu item KD@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings you can make :
the complete path to the device driver for the belt drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ recur@@ ring version of the belt @-@ device .
&quot; if this attitude is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat : before the tape is involved the command takes the load to the drive . with some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations . &quot;
&quot; is the option turned , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the throw in the band@@ width is to lock . possibly this setting does not work in all band@@ width . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched , when solving the inclusion of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically the band will be ej@@ ected . do not use this option with Flo@@ ppy Stream@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if the hardware is enabled , is trying to change its image size for the band@@ width . not all drives support variable block@@ sizes . no matter whether this attitude is active or not , you must &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your band@@ width . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ dat : a band form@@ att@@ ed , it writes a file at the start of the tape . this file should occupy only one memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( N Byte ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this string is cre@@ denti@@ al : seconds , whereby calcul@@ ator the full name of the system is form@@ att@@ ed . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time , where the band were form@@ att@@ ed . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat files .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure t@@ ar -@@ Archive , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - t@@ ar . even other t@@ ar versions should work , as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup association . this symbol is only active when a band is integrated .
&quot; gal@@ lo@@ gue is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system protoc@@ ols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users , where you can get information about your system , or where the system enables quick access to information about problems that may occur on their server . &quot;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users to understand what makes your computer in the background puts . the task of &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol information of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system is stored in different protocol files .
&quot; furthermore , &amp; ks@@ read@@ log enables easy access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; ks@@ um log ; therefore tries to provide some more advanced features , using the protocol @-@ files of certain programs may be fil@@ tered and evaluated . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; a range of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files for the format of the sys@@ log server and for sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this hand@@ book .
as you can see in the following screens@@ hot &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; functions are easy to filter with their help the individual protocol lines of a log file easily fil@@ tered and sort . the individual possibilities for sor@@ ting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
&quot; following the start tries &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; first to open the main protocol @-@ file of the system - the system prot@@ ok@@ es itself ; most likely did not appear with system managers , so you have to find yourself under Linux usually in the folder / var / log , for normal users usually do not have any permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter@@ ing option to filter after a selected crit@@ erion or according to selected character cell . in the default setting , the selection field contains the entry @-@ lines beside the filter all . then a log @-@ line contains only indicated when in one of the columns the character chain of the filter search function is included . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a different entry on this site . the text chain of the filter installation will then be displayed only with the entries in the corresponding column , and enter into the filter line the name of a process , so shows you &amp; ks@@ read@@ log ; all protocol lines which were sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in default setting and helps you to realize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a con@@ spic@@ uous color as protocol @-@ lines of level note . the colour @-@ color display of protocol may be switched off .
&quot; if you want to show only certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or on cr@@ on protocol ) , you can use the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific commands , such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , you use filter@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window , in order to show all the new added protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; file system log ; enables the display of several protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open additional sub@@ windows . once you have chosen a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display . &quot;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ org. You can find more information about the sources of supply of &amp; ks@@ read@@ log ; .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; find also in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion repository file : ks@@ read@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ archive
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and named in the following ) as a k@@ sys@@ v ; this section runs a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sys@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it quickly develops into the standard for the control of program @-@ up at the top of the system in the &amp; Linux world . and therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
&quot; I will not go further here in historical aspects ( e.g. , because I know nothing about it : - ) . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ am and not under / etc . this is therefore important because perhaps someone could attempt to make a machine on System V In@@ it , without re@@ install a new installation and re @-@ format . therefore , you must ensure that the old in@@ it removed from there , if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it is also different from BSD In@@ it , that &apos;s the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . that folder is called r@@ c.@@ . D@@ ort , you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and following the following folder : &quot;
&quot; basically , a whole lot scripts . basically you need a script for any system service that you want to start at the top of the system or when changing to another Run@@ level . system services does not include such things as set@@ ry , which will only be started . such views belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; the r@@ c.@@ local should be in turn to / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even though it doesn &apos;t have much use to do so . you can also let a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to carry out something about what to do with the seri@@ ding connection . &quot;
the kernel is looking at different points after the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds it .
the default Run@@ level is registered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the previous Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change that you can edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab of Hand , and change the 3 . please be very careful when you want to re @-@ fix your system by re@@ boot the system and run the following : &quot;
&quot; but how do you start all the right scripts ? if you enter it in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that there are no proper files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a short@@ cut to one of the script in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
&quot; as starts and stopping in@@ it actually System@@ services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written , that it can be an argument like start and stop . you can actually launch these scripts actually from hand on the command line as follows : &quot;
&quot; this would stick to the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one is included , the script will be called with the argument . if he includes a S , the script will start with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to set a simple way of setting machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server -@@ Run@@ level have , which can only run htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . also , I could have a user -@@ Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; with a mouse or another po@@ inter is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of the Avail@@ able system services on one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also shift scripts between Run@@ lev@@ eling or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . this will only happen if they take an entry from the area of the Avail@@ able system services .
&quot; note : entries will be moved when you move into a new area . to copy them to a new Run@@ level , you need to choose from the menu Edit menu and paste in the target range -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ ting number of a lecture can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you have to edit the sor@@ ting numbers of the surrounding entries before you may once again try to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : currently there is no way to restore messages that were thrown in the tr@@ ash . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator button to enable the various work@@ places ( Avail@@ able System@@ services , Run@@ level 1 stop , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc . ) and the C@@ ursor keys to make a selection top or below the previous version . &quot;
to move one entry to another Run@@ level to move it into cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired Run@@ level with paste ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
&quot; to change the sor@@ ting number or the name of an application manually , press the input button to switch to the Properties dialog . use the tab@@ ulator button to switch between different fields , or press Es@@ c to cast the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data logging , all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . preferences are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise it is saved by &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; restored . changes to pres@@ ets are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ lev@@ les , and now the machine starts again . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; type at the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single , and press the input button to start in single use mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) . &quot;
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; for running under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE , or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) then you must edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way that system services can be started in these distri@@ butions , does not simplify the configuration for the proprietary furniture programs of this distribution , but does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use another distribution : please check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are located in the proper directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache htt@@ htt@@ p@@ d ) are simply without notice , if their configuration files are not available or false . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even vary from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level so that this manual can be added . &quot;
this documentation is related to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to begin , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; &quot;
&quot; after you have made modifications , you need to save it . either you use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry save in the menu file . &quot;
&quot; the main window is a simple application . the main window consists of two cart@@ on cards , user @-@ user and user group list . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it will be the dialogue with user and group properties . &quot;
&quot; some card cards are only shown , if you have enabled advanced system settings . only if you have enabled advanced settings ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a cardboard card will appear , in case shadow -@@ pass@@ codes or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as are installed in BSD @-@ Uni@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; the map pass will be released , in case shadow -@@ pass@@ codes or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as well as BSD -@@ Uni@@ ces are installed . &quot;
this card card appears only if enabled for at least one in @-@ time fil@@ es@@ ystem ( Qu@@ ota ) and initi@@ alizes ( recognizable at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ es@@ ystem ) . here you can modify parameters for each user .
these parameters can be adjusted for each fil@@ es@@ ystem individually . the current file system is selected with the help of the field system with space restrictions .
&quot; the group card inform@@ s about group members of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the field Prim@@ ary group . furthermore , the user can be a member of other groups by placing them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog &apos;s features of the group includes a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the menu user or group or click the appropriate &quot; &quot; Add -@@ button &quot; &quot; button . the editing or delet@@ ing the selected user or the selected group works . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO @-@ boot manager to remove and change the time up to the boats of standard operating system , remove the default operating system , remove , change , change , change , and more . &quot;
