<seg id="240">DNG The Digital negatives file format is a licence-free and open-format format that has been developed by Adobe Systems.

<seg id="408">Another important tool is to be found in the menu under colors Tonscorrection correction. this tool provides an integrated way to use multiple colors. this is helpful when your camera or your scanner always make the same mistake and therefore you can always find the same correction. in the manual for the soundproofing you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility of correcting problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & Present came; tool Farby effects puts you four color effects, a solar-effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a cantarfilter at your disposal."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing was solar isation, also Sabatier mentioned, a effect that was created when one replaced a partially developed pressures of a short lightning. this had the effect that the brightens areas sheltered by the second lights. this tool was a part negative of the picture. this tool allows you to finite this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar isation. at around 50% intensity, the image is not possible to generate chemically possible. an increase will eventually create a negative image so that not on Fotopapier."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar energy efficiency. the original image is the (1) and it works (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid filter sieves the so called" "Velviaquot; -Effect. it differs from a saturation that makes it a stronger contrasting effect, that makes the colors brilliant and glow. try it simple, it embellished many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">"Velvia is the brand name for one on daylight optimised cockaturefilm made by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth structure. Velvia features very saturated color, but also some photographers, especially those hardly recalled landscapes."</seg>
<seg id="416">"the neonfilter simulates Neonlight on the contrasts of the result. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result, and the slider repeat the strength of the neonlight. with large images the filter can charge the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon that you want to correct the color contrasts and the luminosity of your photos with the tools in the menu. all of your granting you can view in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you use the button Ok and you are applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you get a photo of bad light conditions you can get the reverse problem: one too big saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation will reduce it. all changes you can perform in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminaire / gamma / gamma is the tool sound-correction to improve the exposure. even if the dialogue on this tool is very complicated, it requires the area of the slider. concrete, the three slider below the histograms."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window includes a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, of the active channel or the selected area. under the graphs are three slider into the inside and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>

<seg id="480">"sharpened is a traditional tool for harps. it is very fast and simple, but produces, especially in the dark areas, grained images."</seg>
<seg id="481">Unlefe mask works on the contrast of the edges to look a picture sharper. actually it's not a bit; it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it's here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">"reflective is probably the best of the three, because he really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in his application and has several parameters to adapt."</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without focus as well as most of digitised pictures require a correction of the sharpness. these elements are smaller than the dissolution into paper. the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more detrimental to be normal cameras for the private use."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG's images, it is often applied to a camera internal softening. pictures in raw format against it always have to be sharpened while processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner turn a blackish filter during the reading of the picture. if you disable this disable, you get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can obtain useful results by calling a photo with the sharps advertising. you can view it with the menu entry more effectively."</seg>
<seg id="487">"however, they should deal with caution, as the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the edge of edges, but also increases the noise. in general, the most useful technique to sharply focus on the tool. you can easily attain more information and a comparison of all techniques for grinding."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crackly. the solution to draw the image a little soft, is much easier than it increases. use the tool for softness with the menu button lighter and experiment with you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masquerade is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the image. the showcase shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values are creating good results and should get tried out first. an increase in radius or the amount increases the effect. if you make the inexy mask, the noise and the impression of grats are in the proximity of sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents a few pixels on each side of a channel by the filters. high resolution images allow bigger radii. they therefore should sharpens them pictures at the best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage between the original and the original one that is added to the original, thereby the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the Corpora value is a break from the maximum RGB value and to apply differential amount. one can therefore define a minimum difference between the killing of the filter. in this way areas with a soft switch between the killing of sharps, and hence beauty error in virtues, Heavenues and water-surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurred masquerade filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a pig value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitisation came; tool refocused on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted degreasing filter and algorithm from Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool is trying to regenerate an image & quot; this is a better approach than just trying the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Vienna Filtering. it makes use of a technique called FIR Vienna Filtering. it uses the traditional technique of blurred mask. you can start using it from the menu by drawing colors and focus on image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice the circular flows work much better than the Gauß's Faltung. the Gauß's Faltung has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result of the original pixel which is far influenced by the original pixel. the FIR Vienna inverse of the Gauß'schen Faltung will be influenced in most cases even very heavily from the remote pixel. it causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular thrust: this is the radius of circular flow. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images the default value should result in good results. you can insert a higher value if your image is very blurred then however on Heiligenscheine.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1, & eg; add and count. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpness effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"Rauschect: an increase in smoking filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the filter quality is very bad. a good value is 0.03. a high value will be added to the image even further."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal to zero, you might need to increase the correlation and / oderden noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"mattress size: this value determines the size of the transformation type: this value determines good results, especially if you select great values for the circular thrust or the palate's flap. however, note that the module is very slow when you choose big values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">The saving as and charging buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any application-focused parameters that you have set will be saved for later and can be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try all the pieces, color and intensity corrections on the image before you use the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that lots of operations changes that are not immediately visible immediately, but left unpleasantefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you are reading and compress, and eg; as JPEG, you should use the module to the uncompressed picture."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally produced, blurred masquerade better results as sharpness. this could be caused by blurred masks for a bigger neighborhood than shaking."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, a blurred mask must always produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of intoxins. for the Vienna filter you can show that it is the optimal liner notes. the FIR Vienna filter is often better with the processing of small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture that needs to be corrected. this picture was done with a analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for auto-focus lens.</seg>

<seg id="519">"Detailobtain p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a even more homogeneous surface of the picture. a value of 0,9 should obtain details such. a value of 0.7 should be necessary. please note that the details can always be subordinated."</seg>
<seg id="520">Driving dependency Alpha [0.100]: a small value smoothes in all directions while a value close to 1 is only in one direction. if you have a film-gritt or CCD Rauts will produce a high value tick-like pattern. JPEG artefacts are best eliminated in a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">"smoothed [0, 500]: this puts the maximum rotation factor above all else. then set this value to the degree of smoking in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is estimated, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's effect, it needs to be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: on how often the algorithm passes through. normally here is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle-wide da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is small chosen, it should also be small for a long run. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs."</seg>

<seg id="1523">"--squeeet extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and autoStereosystems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--squeeet Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you necessarily want the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information that are manually entered or obtained through the program automatically from the freeDB over the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can be given / needed with & kaudiocreator; and the codification program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with codification programs, there is often a combination of program meant for the Kodierer and this parameters here. the manual or help to the Kodierers explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s can be coded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; added. the result looks as follows: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>

<seg id="1533">"there are in many countries copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator; for use of freeDB is set up, the geographically closest to mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a recent list of mirrors for the online retrieval of & CD; information during the reading of a & CD. alternatively you can download the complete database or (usually monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>

<seg id="1652">"this is absolutely necessary for Synthesizer, which are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events turn into events that understands the synthesizer."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"for example, you can create a MIDI Map, which converts all events of the type change patch to Bright piano in events of the type change patch to Trumpet and thus makes a trumpet sound, if originally a piano should play."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"if you only have a soundcard, you do not need a MIDI Map because all Soundmaps are GM -compatible (including Awe - and CIS cards, FM radio devices and so on)."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"unfortunately, there is no programs to create MIDI maps. so you must edit the appropriate file from hand (using your favorite editor)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all necessary settings for the play of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">"each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section that may appear as often as desired. a prerequisite for it is, however, that each appearance has a different text ID (see below)."</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap... END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options... END Options... END</seg>

<seg id="1660">"please send me your map file as e-mail, so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can be used for devices that are not General-MIDI-compatible."</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section the patches of General MIDI is shown on your specific keyboard. general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the body sign is ignored. it is believed that GM Patches are set in the right sequence (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"optional AllKeysTo M is used to lay all notes that supports this instrument, using the tone with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60) that is similar to a gun. to do this, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so now a MIDI file should play a score with patch 127 (gun-casting), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and performs the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant, with which every sound represents another Persian instrument (drum, basins, Maracas & etc;) and does not have the one in which the sound means the tone height of the same drum (as some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">KEYMAP section is needed to indicate how Tones appear on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you just need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to form tones on the perky channel. look as an example for the provided keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to clear some channels on other. if you want to switch between the first and second channel, simply make it simple in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (general MIDI on channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi-Devices, 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered between 0 and 15, assembled by following the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"N is the channel, which is built on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap will of course use the name for this channel. if you use the Forcepatch option, all events will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, all events will be used as patch x."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The option Forcepatch can be useful for example to always use the perkelling patch on the perc channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio will be multiplied, in which ratio Pitch-Bender events will be multiplied with the value n, this is calculated with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only passed on. the value 4096 is used, so that in the Map file (no decimal hearkenes)."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM indicates that a keyboard, which is a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, a sound higher to play. unfortunately, we try to find some keyboards about two tints up to an octave. to try the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit by & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI Map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. these can be found in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard (one for each MIDI channel). on these clots you see which sounds just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a selection list, where you have changed an instrument, the button does not have more green, but red to indicate that no longer is used the original tool."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The Kanalansicht has (until now) two different views to indicate the played sounds. the view can be displayed in the menu Settings under the Point Kanalansicht: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed-LCD shows the speed when a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the pace of a song. so if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow down. to change the pace, use the arrows to turn left and right from the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc.. this allows the same MIDI files on two different devices to very different results, as well as two different musicians play the same notes in a very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can impose nobody & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB, while an mp3-file 4 MB needs a similar sound quality. at a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc. you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; which happens because & kmid; without having support. to remove the problem you must download a source distribution and install (for example from kmid; 's Home)</seg>

<seg id="2283">"the program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed exactly within these lines. and there was no evidence of the places where the changes did not change. this changes did a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes made to white characters. later many more useful features have been added.</seg>

<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot & ksystem log; functions are easy to filter with their help the individual protocol lines of a log file easily filtered and sort. the individual possibilities for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">"following the start tries & ksystem log; first to open the main protocol-file of the system - the system protokes itself; most likely did not appear with system managers, so you have to find yourself under Linux usually in the folder / var / log, for normal users usually do not have any permission to read."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filtering option to filter after a selected criterion or according to selected character cell. in the default setting, the selection field contains the entry-lines beside the filter all. then a log-line contains only indicated when in one of the columns the character chain of the filter search function is included."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can also select a different entry on this site. the text chain of the filter installation will then be displayed only with the entries in the corresponding column, and enter into the filter line the name of a process, so shows you & ksreadlog; all protocol lines which were sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default setting and helps you to realize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a conspicuous color as protocol-lines of level note. the colour-color display of protocol may be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to show only certain process (e.g. in the system protocol or on cron protocol), you can use the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific commands, such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, you use filtering."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window, in order to show all the new added protocol lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"file system log; enables the display of several protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open additional subwindows. once you have chosen a subwindow, select a protocol to display."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website at http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. You can find more information about the sources of supply of & ksreadlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; find also in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion repository file: ksreadlog; in & kde; -archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and named in the following) as a ksysv; this section runs a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv. "</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the V Init quickly develops into the standard for the control of program-up at the top of the system in the & Linux world. and therefore, because it is easier to use, powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"I will not go further here in historical aspects (e.g., because I know nothing about it: -)."</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binary file is under / sam and not under / etc. this is therefore important because perhaps someone could attempt to make a machine on System V Init, without reinstall a new installation and re-format. therefore, you must ensure that the old init removed from there, if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init is also different from BSD Init, that's the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc. that folder is called rc.. Dort, you will find rc.sysinit and following the following folder:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"basically, a whole lot scripts. basically you need a script for any system service that you want to start at the top of the system or when changing to another Runlevel. system services does not include such things as setry, which will only be started. such views belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"the rc.local should be in turn to / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even though it doesn't have much use to do so. you can also let a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to carry out something about what to do with the seriding connection."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking at different points after the program init and starts the first one finds it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is registered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the previous Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change that you can edit / etc / inittab of Hand, and change the 3. please be very careful when you want to re-fix your system by reboot the system and run the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how do you start all the right scripts? if you enter it in rc3.d, you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no proper files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a shortcut to one of the script in the directory init.d. "</seg>
<seg id="2968">"as starts and stopping init actually Systemservices? quite simply: each of the scripts is written, that it can be an argument like start and stop. you can actually launch these scripts actually from hand on the command line as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stick to the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one is included, the script will be called with the argument. if he includes a S, the script will start with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people wish to set a simple way of setting machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server -Runlevel have, which can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. also, I could have a user -Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of the Available system services on one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also shift scripts between Runleveling or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. this will only happen if they take an entry from the area of the Available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries will be moved when you move into a new area. to copy them to a new Runlevel, you need to choose from the menu Edit menu and paste in the target range -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of a lecture can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you may once again try to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: currently there is no way to restore messages that were thrown in the trash. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator button to enable the various workplaces (Available Systemservices, Runlevel 1 stop, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc.) and the Cursor keys to make a selection top or below the previous version."</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move one entry to another Runlevel to move it into clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired Runlevel with paste (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of an application manually, press the input button to switch to the Properties dialog. use the tabulator button to switch between different fields, or press Esc to cast the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data logging, all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise it is saved by & ksysv; restored. changes to presets are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the standard Runlevles, and now the machine starts again. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">"type at the LILO -Prompt linux single, and press the input button to start in single use mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order)."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; for running under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you are using & SuSE, or Delix (DLD) then you must edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way that system services can be started in these distributions, does not simplify the configuration for the proprietary furniture programs of this distribution, but does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use another distribution: please check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are located in the proper directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache htthttpd) are simply without notice, if their configuration files are not available or false."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even vary from version to version. if you use a different distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel so that this manual can be added."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is related to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to start with & kuser; to begin, it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser;"</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you have made modifications, you need to save it. either you use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the entry save in the menu file."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"the main window is a simple application. the main window consists of two carton cards, user-user and user group list. to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double-click on the entry. it will be the dialogue with user and group properties."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some card cards are only shown, if you have enabled advanced system settings. only if you have enabled advanced settings (Quota) for users, a cardboard card will appear, in case shadow -passcodes or for example / etc / master.passwd as are installed in BSD-Unices."</seg>
<seg id="2994">"the map pass will be released, in case shadow -passcodes or for example / etc / master.passwd as well as BSD -Unices are installed."</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card appears only if enabled for at least one in-time filesystem (Quota) and initializes (recognizable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the filesystem). here you can modify parameters for each user.</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be adjusted for each filesystem individually. the current file system is selected with the help of the field system with space restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the group card informs about group members of the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the field Primary group. furthermore, the user can be a member of other groups by placing them in the large field."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"the dialog's features of the group includes a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list."</seg>
<seg id="2999">"to add a user or group, select Add from the menu user or group or click the appropriate" "Add -button" "button. the editing or deleting the selected user or the selected group works."</seg>
<seg id="3000">"with this module you can install the LILO-boot manager to remove and change the time up to the boats of standard operating system, remove the default operating system, remove, change, change, change, and more."</seg>
