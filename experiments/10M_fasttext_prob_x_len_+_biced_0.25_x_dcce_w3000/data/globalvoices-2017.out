&quot; although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely great .
&quot; as many of my generation I have also grown up with American films , American music has been read and maintained American authors . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this land had such a profound effect on me that I was primarily journalist for an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gr@@ ay Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , who covered with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ ff , who covered the first Federal Court of judges , which were his interest to occupy them . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; mine was &quot; as if the absolute truth is , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , had only enhanced my admir@@ ation for the USA . &quot;
&quot; I said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting , that you can always be that you are , and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even had a very black@@ ish letter written about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much was written about xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is to me how he goes with his lif@@ ter @-@ minded .
he never stops along the mountain as you say so beautiful .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks about how a former colleague put it , and openly explains his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes which he won in the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number , which has ever reached by the party . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support these big@@ otte personality I wonder@@ ed ?
I was unable to reconc@@ ile his voters with the people who I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; for example , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of journ@@ alism programme , people from all over the world is rising , a deep unbeliev@@ ing person , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Tru@@ mp@@ s International illustr@@ ates not by Peter Bh@@ atia , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ atia and I met with our common love for basketball , and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix Suns &quot; in the game . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s Int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity that I lived with Sandy who lives for life long , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like their son . &quot;
&quot; it still fits them with the commitment of Krist@@ i , who is always with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of American lives . &quot;
&quot; then there was Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise couns@@ el helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and those made by them em@@ ailed values of my love for America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp &apos;s decision to nom@@ inate Republi@@ can presidential system , they offered me a grip and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps due to its cont@@ emp@@ t to non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the discussion with the idea that people have voted for Tru@@ mp because they were either belonging to racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , broke me nearly the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the Tru@@ mp @-@ voters as R@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; meeting people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is super@@ ficial and respectful and indicates an in@@ capacity to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the h@@ ectic changes in their communities are not considered .
&quot; could it be that these elect@@ ors , of whom are the most white , voted for Tru@@ mp because they wanted to recover control of a country which she has disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they wanted to say that in this America they are still important ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who would look down with cont@@ emp@@ t to those who look different from it . &quot;
&quot; white &quot; &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( . . ) : as much as &quot; &quot; el@@ ong@@ ation of the white against all other eth@@ ni@@ es &quot; ; terms of white in relation to wh@@ ites and wh@@ i@@ pl@@ ash , which means so much as s@@ eu@@ der@@ sad ) , as the big Van Jones called , has exactly the killed that America has so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people all over the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is nonetheless a powerful idea - what faith or background you may have , America is always welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this land chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ ans , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; but with the choice of Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , there is a huge part of the White America to say that promise : to hell with mani@@ fol@@ dness , religious freedom and the entire concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back on the ruin . &quot;
&quot; with all of this , I have to think about K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who was fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
on a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowds .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a lau@@ t@@ strong &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; could Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; dis@@ armament the crowd .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; I answered them .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they called and their voices were lau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; could someone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a consistent and lau@@ t@@ strong &quot; NO ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan completed with the words : &quot; &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tru@@ mp , that is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his Son was like , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tru@@ mp@@ s country , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America . &quot;
and this breaks me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city Cat@@ eur@@ a jointly ?
&quot; that music , which is played in both places , not only the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a great gar@@ bage dump : only 16 o@@ aks south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an ancient colonial city which is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
&quot; for some years now , La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musi@@ ca@@ de ) has now been playing in the municipality : one of the children and adults of an existing Symphony Orchestra , which has found an opportunity to overcome the surrounding poverty with their music instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for their drugs of abuse and the gangs . &quot;
&quot; however , this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and the youth had such a rare g@@ limmer of hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band@@ members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi : &quot;
&quot; once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the above streets to go to their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they come and play with sh@@ iny eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clar@@ inet , obo@@ e , flute , tim@@ esc@@ os and Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from Tr@@ ash
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village that is practically located on the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay , capital - on instruments that are made of recur@@ ring waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with recur@@ rent instruments , which are made from local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where Rec@@ ycl@@ er works under direction of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez to turn parts of the incident . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ i@@ ble viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cello , contr@@ ab@@ asses , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trumpet , tromb@@ ones and perc@@ ussion , all produced out of the tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez is remin@@ is@@ cent of a local ec@@ ologist and musician instructor of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , to the initial time : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult , because we had no place for rehear@@ sals , and we had to teach at the same place where children had known no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something which he had never seen before : a made of tr@@ ash manufactured violin .
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments from recovered material and called The Rec@@ ycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentation called &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ical gar@@ bage dump ) shows the musical performance :
the world produces about one billion tons of tr@@ ash each year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poorest people - as humans in Cat@@ ac@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here it turns him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectacle from tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has even played his music in front of Pope Fr@@ ench@@ man :
these East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight the illegal fishing industry
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fought the wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this article written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the republi@@ cation is done as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices concerning the sharing of content .
&quot; in West Africa , at that time , was known that this ship was already operated in liber@@ ated waters of illegal fishing , before it sought the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; at this same time , East African countries were raised about accordingly and little to be welcomed to a legal bre@@ cher of these kinds at its co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles mobili@@ zed quickly against the ship . they ref@@ ra@@ ined him to place one of their ports , and also refuse to give it a fishing association . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Ur@@ suddenly was the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply dism@@ issed everything &quot; , &quot; reminded Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a conductor of the Ken@@ yan fisher@@ man . he is part of a team that discovered the ship in itself and followed . &quot;
2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch the fish there .
&quot; finally , it was also comp@@ elled to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia , because of the pill@@ age of the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Ill@@ egal F@@ ishing ( Ill@@ eg@@ ale fishing stop ) . &quot;
&quot; the members of this network are alongside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries , which at that time exp@@ elled the Premier from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and working together . you can exchange information and stand each other wherever it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable trust@@ s project En@@ ding Ill@@ egal F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden because of it is extremely difficult to split up . hence the illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing from regions .
&quot; inten@@ tional abuse of existing laws , to which certain habitats and types are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems can harm , which have a del@@ ik@@ ates balance . &quot;
&quot; however , while actions against illegal fishing industry were once formed due to bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ dles and also through the sn@@ ail shell , with the information between individual countries , so the actions occur in real time , with trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the individual countries can exchange among themselves , like lists of existing licenses , news about suspected activities or details that can be noticed during a port spec@@ tions or read . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea , by means of satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to mark ships , which fish in dil@@ uted areas . also let themselves discover so suspic@@ ious driving routes - such , that a ship rel@@ ies its consolidated fish on other ships . &quot;
&quot; in the ideal case , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license , where they were traveling and possibly also whether they have a criminal register . &quot;
&quot; countries that are opposed to illegal fishing , can refuse to refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports on basis of this information . and that the ships will not be forced to sell their cargo . and that they can even forced to the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is then about considerable financial losses for the owner , what means that the illegal fishing activity is more financially worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , leading director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to win more estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover , which inv@@ ade eight members of the network at ISH @-@ i every year because of its illegal fishermen , which penet@@ rate into East African waters . &quot;
&quot; in East Africa , one of the most productive t@@ una @-@ fish stocks , has led to the region &apos;s commercial fishing from around the world . among these also no illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; their practices include other activities including sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit lic@@ enc@@ ers , indicating ph@@ antasi@@ es , the fish protected species and the fish in nature conservation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they specifically util@@ ise the lack of international co @-@ operation and make the weaknesses of a complete control system ; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier , a ship could have illeg@@ ally fish and a country could then say &apos; you dar@@ ing my harbor . &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &quot; Come to me &quot; . &quot; &quot; and exactly this legal hose is trying to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
so far the closed front works .
since its foundation F@@ ISH @-@ i has participated in more than 30 investigations of suspic@@ ious ships .
&quot; it has exposed criminal networks , which had f@@ ake licenses distributed in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has followed whis@@ per@@ ed ship@@ ments and found it . &quot;
&quot; due to its collaboration with INTER@@ POL , the international authority to combat crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing through major distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our studies lead us quite far into the networks organized crime &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; he builds a system , which is to help the F@@ ISH @-@ i , di@@ gest ships of precise places . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always further developed , also helps to up@@ lift the illegal ships that would like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g Mat Tr@@ acking , which deals with fishing data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems , so what they can no longer be saved by satellite . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects different information levels with each other . it aims to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but there can actually influence F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations to react to the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing companies ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth opens together with Google and the Marine Reserve Oc@@ e@@ ana platform for Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data and by means of which the position of each trac@@ e@@ able ship can be displayed worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; join forces with the neighbors to get a better picture of who what to do - that &apos;s just mind , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to join and combine their resources to the investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable trust@@ s has a similar project to run , in which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only crimin@@ als , but they are also deter@@ red . &quot;
&quot; ships that were conf@@ isc@@ ated with no license earlier and hardly to count on consequences , now they know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i participated in the meantime a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fis@@ sur@@ ing boats have more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia , Gre@@ ko 1 had elabor@@ ated , Gre@@ ko 1 found in@@ spec@@ s there , the insp@@ ectors found there on board tow ar whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries even notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; in West Africa each hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 six countries joined together in 2015 , called the West Africa Task Force . also they are now fighting the illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With security is the goal , even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member of Somalia was released : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was on the road under false flag . and not only the ship was used without a license and were used to tow ar ds that are now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated its waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with taking resolutions towards Gre@@ ko 1 set the strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative way working methods to protect oceans actually works throughout the world ocean . Emma Bry@@ ce is freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . she writes about the topic environment , technique and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; your articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . location in Venezuela is increasing to : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of reg@@ ain the country . &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of fier@@ ce demonstrations .
they are regarded as protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela , the application of the opposition had rejected the opposition to a referendum , re@@ acted to the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into the void . &quot;
under the has@@ ht@@ ag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( e.g. : the return of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land area Bar@@ inas , in the northern regions of Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central @-@ northern reserve , Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at Isla Margar@@ ita in the federal state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuously which makes itself remarkable in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicine .
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw in the revival of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , the chance of a fundamental change . ultimately , however , the delivery of a re@@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Marianne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in their latest articles the context of the government of government . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and tissues entr@@ ances among the highest all over the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % ) and in which a grave and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine was considered the only way to reg@@ ain his institutional structures and to close a new government . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , pictures of stories they tell about , as well as reports of supp@@ ression and abuse . &quot;
&quot; especially big waves , the news about police repression in the central @-@ north @-@ situated city of Marac@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; there , the prot@@ esters moved back to the local Cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed supporters of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later , the cathedral could safely leave the cathedral again but the protests went further . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country there were some demonstr@@ ators to hold the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ ary T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira carry no redness , because you could see anything else , what many nation@@ als do not have ! &quot;
meanwhile a Info@@ graphic makes the round that the extent of repression per day is :
&quot; thus , the dictatorship has suppres@@ sed the country . &quot;
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the call for an amalg@@ am@@ ation process - this has now been proven in the eyes of many thanks to the presence of countless people on the road .
my@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ d@@ ado claim that 1 % of the sig@@ natur@@ es are f@@ ake .
here is your revival !
on the road !
&quot; &quot; &quot; others consider these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government that has taken little of their view against the devast@@ ating economic crisis and thus preferred to be concerned with critical voices : &quot;
you have taken us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are getting more and more of frequency and intensity .

&quot; this is an adap@@ ted version of an interview by Al@@ ejo Gó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on August 23 , 2016 to D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ inian side event . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and will be published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to see the atro@@ cities in the Argent@@ inian city of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; when an adult man said Qui@@ x@@ ano now in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a , in the province of Córdoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the process , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not picked up his life .
&quot; starting with the Bür@@ de , the same name as his father , to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 he suffered enough . &quot;
34 years of age he retained the family @-@ ger@@ ent for themselves .
in the situation then I believed that was right .
I felt like a secret .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , you do not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; then I could not know that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ be@@ am@@ ter . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship of 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , was his father from 1976 to 1978 . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .
archi@@ val .
&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressor , who is charged for ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ x@@ anos son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and he was before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows , which great power has a parent and how this child has chosen for himself a way of rede@@ mption . &quot;
from the sports hall to a military base
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a young , mixed martial arts . &quot;
all named him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; I told my father of him , and a few days later he showed me a black and I called me to identify my friend . &quot;
he said :
&quot; you are a Ar@@ sch@@ loch , you have friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
just click that they will not cause you one day and I must save you .
the ac@@ ron@@ ym ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ cion@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Labour Party in Argentina . &quot;
therefore he offered me to go back to the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; he said to me , I would become obe@@ di@@ ently . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . because so my Father had moved me .
&quot; on the head@@ rest , I had to destroy the papers that heard the prison@@ er . &quot;
&quot; these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , Prop@@ ag@@ and@@ amat@@ erial , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ in dr@@ practice the prisoners are tor@@ tured
&quot; my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la , all in 1976 . &quot;
&quot; during the first time and the last time , he let me wait at the entrance in the car . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time , he command@@ ed me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ gaining , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges , just everything possible . &quot;
everything of it was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small into a ceiling box and command@@ ed me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that this was a great cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ ac@@ ke , where the stolen items were dropped , and held me with an guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; I sp@@ ed in , and saw a goat , on which humans were tor@@ tured . &quot;
she looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ springs .
later I found out that they attached to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the person &apos;s body that was just there .
&quot; they bound a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ shot him with water and said to him a charge of 220 Volt to the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was s@@ app@@ alling ... like a dirty no@@ bility .
&quot; years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell immediately back and I realized that that is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget that smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do such a much harm ?
I knew that these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and have been loos@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the trial ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of mat@@ tresses on which naked men face the face down - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
near the entrance dropped people still on the mat@@ tresses .
&quot; when my father noted that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ st du so , Ar@@ sch@@ loch ? &quot;
&quot; I was s@@ blessed , Why did you otherwise brought me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my father told her home .
&quot; beside La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms that were referred to as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero brought a man together and killed .
&quot; ( according to the survi@@ vor@@ s of the civil war Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged at La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process , the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia leads the leader of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former Fol@@ der chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way to which you came in , is also the way , on which the kidn@@ apped came here . &quot;
&quot; when you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names have changed and they were assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ised a number .
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were cast into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be lost . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the dis@@ appearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War &apos; of War &apos;
my father brought all sorts of things to come home .
at that time in age I had no idea what the &quot; war@@ nings &quot; - how they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was in the military for myself - I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war bu@@ zz is a b@@ aj@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs which one assumes an enemy , which you fought . &quot;

&quot; but if you go into a house and enter the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , painting , money ... ste@@ als , then that is not a war@@ nings but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of security forces , in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t understand it .
&quot; I was also officers in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never really like to enter a house , and to ste@@ al everything in it . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
&quot; once he called me a crime , and I said , &quot; &quot; and you , whom you walk on the streets ? &quot;
you are not a crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded before W@@ ut , struck me and cri@@ ed : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and bring you independent . &quot;
therefore we need no one else !
so was my father .
I have no only good memory of him .
&quot; when I stepped out in the trial , I showed a photo of that time on which I carried out a jack@@ et and a wheelchair accessible from w@@ ool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
we were not poor but he still brought clothing to home .
&quot; at that time , the defense , a fellow @-@ conspir@@ ators had been in this crime . I disgu@@ ised , no problem , they can lay down to the burden what they wanted . &quot;
&quot; anyway , I was there to pre@@ di@@ ct . &quot;
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearances of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I find rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if one has only children , one sees the value of a life . &quot;
one develops and real@@ ises that it is wrong .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have to ex@@ clude during the dictatorship of the dictatorship . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses will disappear ? &quot;
why children are kidn@@ apping ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl home , his mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our house , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could just have done them into prison .
&quot; I appreciate it was just decided to kill these people , but why their cor@@ p@@ ses will disappear ? &quot;
did these people not have been handed over to families who were given to their mor@@ tal rem@@ n@@ ants ?
the dis@@ appearances of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act that man can do to man .
&quot; my father told me , when democracy was introduced again , they fet@@ ched machines to remove the mor@@ tal rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were broken and somewhere dispos@@ ed - no idea where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clarify things : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
&quot; the thought , to show my Father appeared during a conversation , as he was under house arrest . &quot;
&quot; I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities , which I had to experience again . &quot;
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt so in@@ war@@ dly and in@@ quired , for the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian emotions &quot; they were supposed to be well defended . &quot;
then sh@@ ou@@ ded I :
how can you tell us what to say ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you were forced to take part in it as a child .
&quot; he only disgu@@ ised me , but then forgive me . &quot;
this is what I did .
in 2010 I made the first ad .
I had finally recognised that he was a criminal .
nobody can pret@@ end to me that I am taken before . I finally ended up against my own Father .

Piero De Monti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he put the following words to the Swiss chamber :

&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organisation H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. who represents the children of people who were killed or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the trial lasted more than three years , but the research of it took 39 years . &quot;

a translation error makes older people of Kyoto to &quot; terrible drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto where you can extend his licence .
the photo was distributed in social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his licence , in the last month witnesses of a completely ab@@ used translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign the Japanese word says that the &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; means &quot; mis@@ diagnosed - maybe but also with mal@@ em back@@ locks &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; as &quot; &quot; fright@@ able motor@@ ists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from 1 to 20 September , the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the input range and in the building itself . &quot;
editing the original pictures of Joshua Lev@@ ine used in the social media .
&quot; the bug was the transl@@ ator Julian Hol@@ mes , one of the inhabitants of Ky@@ pics . he was also aware of the local time . &quot;
the Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to the elderly and in an international city like Kyoto , simply unacceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation is first removed . the name &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; fright@@ ening drivers &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the pre@@ fecture , ap@@ olog@@ ised for the translation errors . furthermore , it stated that the bug had already been included in the text that they had been received from transl@@ ators , and that the translation has not been tested on their accuracy before it was released . &quot;
a blog@@ ger reported like this follows :
&quot; we sincerely sorry that older people felt thanks to the insufficient correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News put together a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; awesome &quot; old motor@@ ists in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; terri@@ bly &quot; &quot; was den@@ o@@ unced as an in@@ appropriate description of the drivers . according to the police there is the proportion of older drivers who are land@@ locked in accidents , but definitely cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture , for example , was caused in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 un@@ sei@@ zur@@ es of seniors . this corresponds to a proportion of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , senior seniors 1.@@ 8@@ 03 of a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; thus , its share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents have fallen in total , the proportion of those caused by seniors caused within the same period . &quot;
&quot; the named reporting stated in the published version of the article comments to light , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently against older drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo on the translation errors has been given the following comments :
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; sc@@ ary drivers &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
- &quot; If wrong is the translation actually not at all , or ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t find that there is a real translation error .
there are not a few such comments .
why En@@ gr@@ ish is so widespread in all Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true finding pit for these bizarre errors in English .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
&quot; to over@@ count you need two important skills : passive knowledge , to understand the starting text and to use active language skills to transfer him to the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is case with native languages . in general , the belief that transl@@ ators are in target language - not in the initial language - mother lingu@@ ists should be . &quot;
&quot; thus , a French native speaker , for example , should be translated from English to French - not from the French into English . &quot;
photo by Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Bar@@ on .
&quot; many Japanese firms do not employ workers with English as a mother tongue , which could make translations into English . this may well be trac@@ ed to an understanding of the reason@@ ing , cost @-@ reasons or the relatively small number of English native languages . &quot;
&quot; some companies that don &apos;t have any foreign employees , have translations to make them work internally . then , the Japanese employee , whose English is considered the best @-@ trained to be trained to transl@@ ators - regardless of how good or bad his language skills are really good . &quot;
photo by Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Bar@@ on .
machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the wor@@ r@@ alled and pu@@ zz@@ led phrases produced by machine translation , show that this technique has not yet been replaced by any human transl@@ ator . this applies to some languages very special . &quot;
&quot; some of the most rare English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ en@@ ian prints , often used T @-@ shirts or po@@ ckets , are only used for stylish reasons - not to be read or understand at all . &quot;
photos of Flick@@ r @-@ users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be neither acceptable nor acceptable , but by big companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , one can expect more careful translations . &quot;
Kyoto will hopefully use a serious source of its translations in the future .
Venezuela : take protests and tz@@ ens@@ ations on the Internet and TV
&quot; main@@ page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , 2013 Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users , they have no access to online radio station Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet pres@@ ences from V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were also no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other on @-@ line transm@@ itter recordings of the protests in Car@@ acas , which were organised by op@@ posi@@ tional groups who oppose the government Nicol@@ ás Ma@@ du@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court opened the parliament and had the responsibilities of the Parliament upon the executive and the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author with Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is connected , and recommended to the users , VP@@ N ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VP@@ N .
it seems that internet pages Venezu@@ el@@ ian providers are once again locked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media has been argu@@ ed in the coverage of the coverage of protests in 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Tel@@ ecommunic@@ ations were reported to them with fin@@ es and lock@@ ings when they continue to report on demonstrations as the Commission saw this as &quot; &quot; Call to Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without wir@@ ing television and informative national TV channels I signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this continues to be cheaper than two lit@@ res of lem@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay has been in@@ accessible by a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online stations . this also concerns the website that the National Assembly out@@ performs its meetings . &quot;
&quot; previous post @-@ research of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had results that local internet providers stay in Venezuela . these are a technique of failing to answer DNS requests certain domains . &quot;
&quot; when a website is blocked by DNS , the server is incorrect or denied the request when calling for such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS @-@ Lock : @ el@@ d@@ oli@@ ot@@ v @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net

&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on shipment . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multi@@ medi@@ al reporting about current events in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slave to obtain an education
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was a child Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house in which she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and coll@@ ects witness to other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , who have been precisely how they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the shorten@@ ed version of a report of Kur@@ dish , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series called &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , which is edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America and will be re @-@ released . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga lived eight years in a household , in which they lived not together with the family who lived there . &quot;
&quot; shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house again and heard , as the owner of the house was filled with pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; that , from which something has become , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was never treated as a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ mean itas , in Paraguay that is forced to work more than 46.@@ 000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money over@@ pass their min@@ der@@ old son or their min@@ e@@ year old daughter to another , rich family . in exchange the child receives food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned is that children must do countless days of house@@ work , which can never be paid and victim of abuse and abuse - and all that in the framework of a contract you cannot lift . &quot;
&quot; this practice is widely used as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice in Paraguay due to participation and acceptance by large sections of society , and in spite of numerous complaints from human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after graduation , Al@@ var@@ enga worked for a couple of years for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; in doing so she spoke with cri@@ mp @-@ itas , especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered witness , resear@@ ched and p@@ ran@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name the things in the name , for the feeling of gratitude to vacc@@ inated the Cri@@ ad@@ itas is guaranteed , guaranteed in general un@@ law@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double illusion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , who will take their daughter in the faith that they will complete their education , improve their position in society and take something out of it , &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family is involved with the girls and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the faith that they would give someone a chance that otherwise wouldn &apos;t get an education and perhaps even star@@ ve . &quot;
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mis@@ used , his family will learn a lot of years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 the previously relatively unknown phenomenon , which is held in the dark in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen household , but a face . &quot;
&quot; as Carolina Mar@@ ín at Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú came to hospital , her body showed traces of violent sho@@ cks . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former Mil@@ ky Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who is working as civil war in the population .
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira struck a long time with a stick on Mar@@ ín , until they suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of a young girl .
some days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the mur@@ dered child was a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations such as UNIC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep experience of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s practice to the death of the girl .
they marked the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest and called that there should be no other Carolina &apos; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows registered as children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to hurt the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the couples and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded for a fast examination of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl , which was their Cri@@ ad@@ ita to be sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes before judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be the case when the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
&quot; Cri@@ ad@@ itas is exploited not only as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was ten years old when the ro@@ ast who worked her father , she had to sign up and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers had to work all , and started to sell on the street or in the market sweets , to make money . &quot;
but they all went further to the school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita to the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ enga worked between four and six hours every day .
&quot; in doing so , she had to divide the time so that you still have time to learn . &quot;
she stood up at 5 pm every morning and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
&quot; for example , it puri@@ fies the refrigerator , p@@ used the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the ground . &quot;
&quot; when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more she was finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
&quot; however , that time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ var@@ enga says that she had never been hungry , but he didn &apos;t get un@@ bound@@ ed food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the landlord &apos;s library than eating from the refrigerator , &quot; reminds them . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; on some evenings of the landlord Al@@ var@@ enga , next to him and to read editorial from Op@@ position@@ ings like &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to convince them to give no faith in reports of the official media through the dict@@ ator of the dict@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; he held her for intelligent , but did not keep her with her . &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened to while he spoke about policy , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they were of the opinion that Al@@ var@@ enga believed that Al@@ var@@ enga who heard the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , home to their native language Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they had the education , which they had enabled to lose again , explained . &quot;

&quot; in the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the inland , which wants to work . &quot;

Journal of law prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian Treaty of parliament@@ arians recently agreed to a bill that voted &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ulations &quot; &quot; regarding the use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; when he is accepted by the Parliament , users and users must register social media in Egypt at a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , then a place would be set up , which is in charge of making citizens a permission to acc@@ use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of acceptance of the law , users and users have to register on the site of the site with their proper name and personnel numbers to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; it fails to do this , such a penalty could be det@@ ention of up to six months in prison or a cash @-@ bu@@ zz . &quot;
&quot; the bill introduced , consisting of six par@@ agr@@ ine , and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; every application , which is running through the Internet and is used to communicate with others via voice , video editing and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is being en@@ forced upon how the design cannot impose on how Egyptian authorities should impose on how Egyptian authorities should not register the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies .
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdu@@ l Satt@@ ar , Member of Parliament of Parliament and sponsors of the legislative publishers , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and a password to come through the fire@@ wall to block the Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to set a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . because of which it would be necessary for the Egyptians , to access the network in order to access the network . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not yet known that such plans exist . &quot;
experts and experts on site are skep@@ tical regarding the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; leading research methods &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
&quot; I have two doubt on the technical capacity and the understanding of any authority in Egypt , concerning things that have to do with technology . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they are se@@ ven@@ ous physical public and private rooms , they could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; when I take them seriously , then it means that they will establish a strong surveillance system to request citizens or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a court process . &quot;
that is technically not realistic - but in Egypt all is possible .
&quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislative and Constitutional committees before it goes to the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement is successful or not , the draft is consistent with a pro @-@ military thought in the parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and assured that no devi@@ ating Nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Kur@@ dist@@ an area in the north @-@ east of Iraq are working on the Ti@@ ersch@@ utz@@ lig@@ ator H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organization to protect the spiritual leop@@ ards .
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of leop@@ ards which crosses Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . overall , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and the frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they are becoming less pre@@ y . &quot;
why is this certain type of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; how R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only resi@@ dual rob@@ bery in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecos@@ ystem is also dependent on that there is a big rob@@ bery . &quot;
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ards really is small and goes against zero . when the team in the video therefore determines that they have a shot of a large cat in the camera all that H@@ aza breaks out in pure joy .
&quot; as a trained Bi@@ olog@@ in , R@@ aza is passionate about another side of their country , which is not only between war and conflict . &quot;
it has been involved in field studies for six years with wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .

&quot; beginning March 2017 , documented in the northe@@ ast@@ ern Japan daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o , the progress made in recent six years to rebuild the life of those who were hit by the triple catastrophe , ts@@ un@@ ami and a atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in S@@ end@@ ai , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture in Japan , had to experience the earthqu@@ akes and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neigh@@ bor of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iv@@ ate were forced , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had all the coastal cities disappear from the map . &quot;
&quot; even in this way , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima have experienced a nuclear accident involving some 160 000 inhabitants left their houses . &quot;
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o shows the progress six years afterwards to rebuild the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese re@@ organization and survey results of those concerned themselves .
&quot; the apartment complex in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iv@@ ano &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ newspaper reported that until December 2015 , in total , 77 percent of the planned spare parts ( signed ) in a sign , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were finished in the pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iv@@ ano . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures could record Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed . &quot;
&quot; Iw@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima is achieved with 70 percent of the balance . &quot;
&quot; however , one still endeav@@ or to think about six years after the catastrophe , evac@@ u@@ ated qu@@ ays of Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald ( War@@ men@@ au ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final spare parts . &quot;
after the triple disaster almost 80 000 people were forced to live in containers .
&quot; in December 2016 still 36 000 people were living from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iv@@ ano . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of the year 2011 evac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 per cent of the evac@@ u@@ fers who converted to the disaster in containers , were converted to final houses . &quot;
&quot; for Iv@@ ano , the number is here at 34 percent . &quot;
the state of works and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures .
&quot; how the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper was able to determine 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were hit by un@@ bi@@ ce until December 2016 , which makes nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fecture is far more difficult .
&quot; during nearly 100 per cent of the fishing boats in Iv@@ ano and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , we have now returned to operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of the fishing boats . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atom@@ ist accident , have moved to the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of ag@@ ro@@ lean @-@ scale farming . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , whereby only 66 percent of the land country from Iv@@ ano and less than 50 percent of the he@@ ar@@ land can be used again in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic accident , because only 690 acres of 5 400 hectares of the agricultural land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima is located in the &quot; &quot; nu@@ cl@@ ever@@ green belt zone &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of tourism , the tourism has again recovered , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima has gone far back . &quot;
&quot; the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iv@@ ano are back to 90 per cent on the same level , as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima &quot; can be found here only 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper also reported that since the disaster almost half of the coastal people , it is harder to earn their living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; to determine a overall picture , the newspaper also conducted numerous surveys under the native population and under the evac@@ uation by . she asked her about the state of re@@ building and also how their emp@@ athy can be found opposite the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
in her introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population in experience .
&quot; the survey created that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , have taken to be prepared to be prepared for the future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 55.@@ 9 percent of the respon@@ dents that were still not done enough in cat@@ astroph@@ es prevention . &quot;
&quot; as it stands for those , who had to be evac@@ u@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima &quot; pre@@ fecture .
&quot; in her edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung also strengthened its attention on the position of the evac@@ u@@ ate of Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima not only had to experience the enormous earthqu@@ akes and the devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , Catalan art . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 evac@@ u@@ als from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were moved into areas outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , a little more than 23 000 people had been converted back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima in permanent spare parts . &quot;
&quot; according to the 2017 , it has still 40 000 inhabitants live from Fu@@ kus@@ hima off their home pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in the cat@@ astroph@@ y areas , most of the evac@@ u@@ ated shel@@ ters are , older than 50 years old . you have to rep@@ ented in proper Beh@@ aus@@ ungen , Iw@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . here are building projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo by 2020 . &quot;

Rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a wide spread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was supplied this week into the intensive care centre : past Friday he had taken him a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke against the head . land@@ wide took part of prot@@ esters in a protest against austerity .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , the social sciences studied at the Bundes@@ univers@@ ität Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a sk@@ ull of she@@ ath trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors op@@ eri@@ ed him on this Saturday and brought him into an artificial com@@ a .
its condition is regarded as critical .
the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus who spread rapidly into Brazil within a few days .
&quot; on the pictures , the face of the police officers , is also identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police force in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás were known that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o will be suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident , from active service . &quot;
&quot; the pictures show the police officers , as he suggests the police in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with its stroke to the face of the students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) . &quot;
&quot; if a police officers went out by a prot@@ esters and end up on the intensive care station , his face would be six months long on television , and the entire oppression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared by Lu@@ iz da Luz , in which you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police forces , and several sanitary just to raise it . &quot;
another video with the same scenes but from a different perspective is also folded in social networks .
in the shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; living for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lived in another federal state , have now donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2.@@ 700 Euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and permit a family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while in the hospital . &quot;

Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to brutal police officers last Friday .

&quot; the MP Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asking the police via l@@ oud@@ speakers to disp@@ ense on violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media p@@ ains its prot@@ agonist , by focusing the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window art@@ board . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported a distor@@ ted glass window in order to make illustrations in a picture with a photo .
&quot; by contrast , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title @-@ story with a single @-@ defined bus . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a dis@@ continuous window @-@ board than about the protests thousands of people who serve to defend oneself for a special cause . &quot;

&quot; also here , the term &quot; Vand@@ alism &quot; is an absurd , dis@@ proportionate meaning , and the typical violence against police police are tu@@ cked by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on the front@@ ational of the police . &quot;
the for@@ un@@ forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar molecules in Cuba were the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the People Community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ ot@@ que , is generally known as a Central - in Spanish sugar mill - no matter what there is no not@@ e@@ worthy sugar@@ s on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were planted in the sugar mills .
&quot; after the initial focus was the sugar cane industry in the region silent , and the factory was lost gradually and after its installations , until only the ru@@ mor was left from steel and concrete . &quot;
about 272 workers had to be re@@ inv@@ ent .
some mist@@ ook the work .
&quot; other res@@ ig@@ ni@@ ed and pen@@ ises daily to the factories , which still preser@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , which rises every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar manufacturing industry does not smoke his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that it exists in the east of the region of sugar mills , which are after a long in@@ active time in operation , because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene reminded me exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would receive the sugar tube factory , but the promise has not been kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar industry resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the I@@ ne@@ ff@@ izi , the bad administrative decision and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production of 1,6 million tons of sugar was produced , less than the 1910 produced . &quot;
&quot; the news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago , but poor harv@@ esting are already no news . &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane sugar cane ?
the old railway station of the church had already seen better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar @-@ production industry was a economic necessity : the 155 sugar@@ s factories were technically dated , and hardly competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons . &quot;
they only allowed the factories to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price increased from about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 the price of un@@ refined sugar varies from 15 to 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the year 2016 &quot; &quot; Agricultural Engine@@ ers &quot; from the OECD and FAO , the Agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production of 2001 would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the supply of raw export would be approximately 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day , the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro came into the sugar factory during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from there , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the down@@ fall came from a total of 98 sugar@@ s factories , more than 65 million people got their full salary for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the Sug@@ ar@@ hr@@ fabrik Greg@@ orio Arl@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene is known as a soldier , known about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated , &quot; fraud . &quot;
&quot; almost all respon@@ dents are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down . &quot;
to get the place they formed a full @-@ time - working group .
&quot; in front of the first month of the year , the first letters started to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially distributed documents , which only differ@@ ed with regard to the parts that would be removed from the addres@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ timo Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could recover every withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was over@@ taking , and the letters were more and more frequent . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge for the nursing factory two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; &quot; the country had no money for even in operation . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was against his will in the st@@ agnation of the factory , for which he helped us . &quot;
&quot; with each part , that he left , dismant@@ led one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the best developed industry area developed by Cuba and the most important work@@ flow has been er@@ ased .
&quot; in many cases there were no alternatives for the work stations and services needed in the communities where they found themselves , were created . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech from 21 October 2002 , the former president looked into the eyes of the present people as he guaranteed that for the areas , whose factories would no longer run into operation , would go well . &quot;
the price of the population for closing the sugar pipe factories
since 2004 sugar cane is only extrac@@ ted high through m@@ illing .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , the People Community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , that a lot of things change , but not always for the better if a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar factory closed , or rather said , when they began to dis@@ assem@@ ble them , they also stopped to asp@@ ire the road , but also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy are asked other factories . &quot;
you have to spare parts .
&quot; without future prospects , there were also many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production serves not even for the supply of the assembly . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are impos@@ ing .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
Ne@@ unk@@ und@@ forty harv@@ ests bring the old soldiers a r@@ aments from two @-@ end p@@ es@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a trag@@ eous person , yet he for@@ gives the lies that one told him not . &quot;
they have been joining him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes with 65 years in R@@ ente , not because it is lacking in power , but because he is bit@@ tered . &quot;

&quot; the first Nations communities in all of Canada are dealing with topics , which are important for them . they do this using Hip Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , we have been bringing mobile studios directly to schools and youth centers in order to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live appearances . &quot;
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Quebec with ten C@@ ree communities and then with the C@@ ree Hip Hop group The North@@ stars together .
&quot; the workshop consequently rises that young participants in discussions topics like &quot; cultural identity , language , study , love , self acceptance &quot; or whatever they come into mind . &quot;
&quot; these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , where young people are the main actors . &quot;
&quot; because the workshops were so liked , the team worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winn@@ eb@@ ago in the U.S. state Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the kite sur@@ pass first nation in British Columbia , for example , the Highway of the Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of Tr@@ ays , &quot; where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or mur@@ dered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ explained .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the mot@@ if of a video player to convey to how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences through globalization . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people speak the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ sk@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation have recorded , the chor@@ us of C@@ ree is sung . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved received a little help from Gary Jol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hip Hop , who gave them a St@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree . &quot;
&quot; at the Fac@@ ebook@@ site of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an stands at the St@@ rop@@ he &apos;s magazine , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody ever interested in me
but I try to go on earth my days
this is the day when you take our cry
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
&quot; but I believe that we will rise up one day , &quot;
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
how can they grow and take advantage of our youth
&quot; in this way , they can do what they are determined by the Creator . &quot;
in the commentary box the reader and supporters of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also holds a contribution and adds the St@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ en@@ manuscript ( which is also published on his blog and will be released here with permission ) :
in Japan plastic materials are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan it can be seen in front of almost every restaurant sculp@@ ting dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , are being served close to the entrance sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( sign ) , &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tics models of the courts &quot; &quot; ) from any dish to be served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers view their plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic materials .
&quot; at the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small companies that produce those plas@@ tic@@ ultur@@ al dishes that the German Fil@@ mm@@ aker Wim Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago documented . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese people , these plastic materials are so frequent that they don &apos;t even realise them . a new trend however , however , trans@@ forms them in show@@ y phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
the blog@@ ger Mat@@ ome published by the blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sho@@ ku@@ u pur@@ u .
&quot; now at the special sale : new with plastic sty@@ led re@@ pri@@ ori@@ zed cell phones , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods have turned to kit@@ z@@ hi@@ des &apos; object , as in this case , cooling agents : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ vel@@ ding mag@@ net magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in Tokyo @-@ Station .
the new boom of eating is increasingly costly .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel shell with seafood ) turned into a cell phone .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as cell phones .
we also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that does not capture your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to watch like an apple with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and this is just the beginning of an increasing anus .
&quot; some mobile phones and phone designers allow you to manufacture your own art work . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or Sal@@ ine is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; is there someone who say would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can ver@@ ish my phone with salmon . &quot;
I think I will be the only fl@@ aw .
this interest in plastic materials can also take a less appe@@ tizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members .
our new mobile phone stand has the shape of mel@@ ting ice .
&quot; in addition , there is also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ cu@@ ffs from dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; other sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic materials can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter using the has@@ ht@@ ag # , to put it in a sign . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to know more about the origin of these trends , then this video gives you an insight into the borough of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi who dedic@@ ates the Bel@@ ie@@ fer@@ ment of the restaurant industry . such as with the sho@@ ku@@ u pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic materials actually are produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survi@@ vor@@ s of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug dealers .

&quot; in reports in@@ - and foreign media on the in@@ famous &quot; &quot; struggle against drug trading &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ bur@@ sts and mo@@ ckers are regularly imposed in statistics . however , this mirror at all not reflect the extent of the human tragedy against this struggle with itself . &quot;
&quot; the reporting on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ell , ur@@ ged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , there is hardly anyone looking at the mo@@ urn or on the congreg@@ ations that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every mor@@ row , behind every mar@@ ry , behind every bone funds in the hundreds of secret gra@@ ves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wo@@ unds might never be cure . &quot;
&quot; this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has called the digital project &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ en@@ a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; with drug wholesale live &quot; ) to give this sacrifice a voice and tells stories about people who gr@@ ated in the fight between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime does not just let us fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , if businesses close because they are threatened by drug retailers and so whole churches have to drive many kilometers to buy something such as milk . &quot;
pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear lives changed &quot; ) tells us exactly these stories .
&quot; one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , each of every weekend of secret tom@@ bs according to his Son . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost only one day her father , her four sisters , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today again to the task we have placed to go and to gra@@ ves , according to the men we loved to seek . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Contr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Contr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an e @-@ shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he was supposed to be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , which is also here with me . &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you stand out the insurance of my father , but they do not get paid off because that demand a ster@@ ies . &quot;
where should we get this ? &quot;
&quot; the editors of &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ en@@ a vi@@ vir con el nar@@ co &quot; &quot; explains why the project is so important : &quot;
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid of . we have to show the international community the conflicts , dis@@ ruption and governance . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in High @-@ Ris@@ ko areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a writer of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this input from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central @-@ Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that you should never see violence as normal , no matter what form it does : &quot;
I have been familiar with disease and sensation journ@@ alism for several years now .
I &apos;m coming every day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with pictures that actually only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from files of experts .
it leaves me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I feel as if I am the One , which is app@@ ella or sad . it appears as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body once belonged . &quot;
I cannot be equally valid or consider it as normal .
it writes on :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks that he is scar@@ ed ( German : drug dealers ) will be when he is great . and it is also not normal that people are hearing songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of offen@@ ders , if they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me it is , as if they were those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they had such a thing . &quot;
I see our weakness here when stories are to mere statistics in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of men is incredible to me , when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearances of 43 students will be justified in a neighbour place that they were &quot; so@@ aking . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they &apos;re trying to speak , that they remain un@@ spar@@ ed of such trag@@ e@@ dies when they are not stir@@ red and silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four @-@ month up@@ tion in the main town district : how a family with dro@@ pl@@ ings was lo@@ oted . in it , she describes how armed crimin@@ als destroyed money for month money from their business until they had not only demol@@ ished the business but also their family were torn apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain goes over again , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again if you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed , phone numbers also . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the more we are removed from each other , the better . &quot;
it included their report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they are kidn@@ apped or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days , if crying would dis@@ solve my deep feelings , but the answers is no , because I forgot how to wept . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of violence by violence .
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man who was killed by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents worry about them . &quot;
&quot; br@@ yan is a commodity and he tells you he himself had to teach yourself how to make a egg coo@@ ks , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the kitt@@ ens who live with it . this is his name for the preparation of the fl@@ aws with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are ir@@ relevant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy who has to live all life out of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , one told him that his mother was van@@ ished . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood has been past two years earlier , when he was just a few blocks from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father saw that shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
as Br@@ yan was born the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez was created :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence accompanied by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders for public safety and government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the Public Bar 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the inc@@ ision of 8,5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot;
these are just a few hundred thousand @-@ thousand stories that can leave organised crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate into the soul of the country .
just a few stories live in view of the new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we cannot forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ en@@ a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; , Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against the drug trade , which present the country in the last four decades , in an intel@@ li@@ gible form . &quot;
when one picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flick@@ r @-@ user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ ARN@@ ING : this contribution and the pages that it linked , include pictures , on which violence is represented . &quot;
&quot; the fact check is important in a moment , in which it is about to lift a ru@@ mor or to be a f@@ ake . &quot;
&quot; but how is the years after something the first time sur@@ faced ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist further . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first release , it was mis@@ leading to educate trag@@ e@@ dies , which have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false p@@ airing of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; &quot; in termin@@ ology by Global Vo@@ ices or First Dr@@ aft News - denied not the fact that there are abundant coverage about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; however , it raises questions about our desire for images to messages . &quot;
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; 2010 , a pet@@ rol station held the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pping and explo@@ ded . in doing so 230 people came to life . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected and therefore devast@@ ated . the streets in the region were become dangerous paths of stri@@ kers that were difficult to sail . &quot;
trag@@ ically fell to the victim of the pet@@ rol trucks .
&quot; official Represent@@ atives described a fire@@ ball , sh@@ u@@ ende houses including a movie theaters in the vicinity , which was full of people , which illustr@@ ates the football World Cup . &quot;
houses were scattered and shorten@@ ed cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the ignorance .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria , &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ Users My@@ stic@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 2015 multi@@ ere photo of the incident to form the gray scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows ranks of a fo@@ al body that has din@@ ed on the ground while people are looking at .
&quot; but here , history does not end its end . &quot;
&quot; over the years , same photo has been ep@@ ti@@ zed several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and are mis@@ diagnosed with real but not so related to trag@@ e@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 the fighters of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the Nig@@ erian district B@@ aga and Dor@@ o Go@@ won .
&quot; ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dramatically from atro@@ cities , in which they had to fl@@ ee . &quot;
houses and shops have been burned and sur@@ names were in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2000 people have mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed , &quot; &quot; no one was back to count Lei@@ chen , &quot; said one citizen to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
many were sm@@ ashed or burned .
only on the basis of satellite photographs could be shown that follow @-@ up time .
the reason for the attack also remained uns@@ ol@@ ved but the army base in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt to gain the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo has been converted back as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ acre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
you are not Charlie .
you are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ usive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ al@@ k@@ sions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all these cases the picture was taken as a test@@ ament to mass@@ acres .
&quot; we continue to express personal comments such as this example mis@@ understand@@ ably the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media , relating to arguments . &quot;
the picture from S@@ ange joined in Myanmar with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a light@@ ning statement , published by the United Nations people , the fl@@ ee could fl@@ ee , rape and a number of dead , some through . &quot;
&quot; while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following to summar@@ ized these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture was taken from an aci@@ di @-@ Arab retro@@ fit , which was mis@@ diagnosed in 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Being , mon@@ ks and politicians have participated in the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to educate this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was accessed last updated on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organisations who called the AF@@ P as their source , had also mis@@ diagnosed Th@@ ein into being this statement , but had not associated with the image from the DR Congo . &quot;
world @-@ wide range of false information
traces of these false coupl@@ ings are back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using a &quot; &quot; opposite picture &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can be crossed . &quot;
a revers@@ ed picture search with the search engine &apos; Eye has been found under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( date of 3 May 2017 ) 344 pictures found the stated image from the DR Congo are very similar .
&quot; they come from a bl@@ ush private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
some have passed wrong reports to form@@ ulate the counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing .
&quot; we have examples for the abuse of abuse and linked with the respective countries , based on what page they had been published , so we want to see the reach more clearly than by the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which were also associated with each other , several examples of miss@@ able use ) can be used . &quot;
here some cases that can now be fully supported ( on the orange map ) :

&quot; the picture was taken out as evidence of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 mass@@ acre ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were linked with it were raised in no religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the goal was to draw attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 &quot;
&quot; after a message which was alleg@@ edly written by a &quot; &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; over the Nig@@ erian mass@@ acre , translated into circulation , like this here on Vietnam@@ ese , and explained it to the fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; from the Embassy in which the picture was contained in the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) shows ink too , but are no longer completely re@@ trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time @-@ related mark@@ ings exist on the Web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and se@@ dition them via image data in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all of these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original un@@ cement from 2010 , the image ultimately carries a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and images
&quot; there are two powerful themes or frames ( single ) , who under@@ go these posts . the first frame is focused on religion . &quot;
the photo was used in regards to larger discussions about the silence in connection with the mur@@ ders of Christians through Muslims and - the defence of the Muslims - the mur@@ ders of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second Fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how a African life is valued as compared to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worthwhile to examine how pictures in connection with these efforts will be used . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers do not give these pictures longer belief . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are millions of people who have inten@@ tional to exercise the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggested that mood of mis@@ - and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and narro@@ wed it the actual di@@ gest@@ ing of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and in Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of large @-@ scale images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
&quot; an argument is that with@@ holding pictures of a ref@@ us@@ al , the tragedy must recognize . sometimes these paintings are even required by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concern that non@@ violent images readers and spect@@ ators des@@ en@@ ate and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , who studied how violent media seem to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to debate in the news media , the fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; Techn@@ ologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . &quot; they will be able to think about the situation in which an image can be in@@ duced , which actually can be dis@@ solved by the context or completely mis@@ used manner . &quot;
&quot; any examination of false grants should also be taken into consideration , as well as internationally . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons used in accordance with CC BY @-@ N@@ D 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ transl@@ atable ( eg . un@@ transl@@ atable ) endeav@@ our@@ able to provide language r@@ alled a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all translate .
such words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ ce@@ able words are already well known today ( as the famous Portuguese su@@ ction ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish brake ) .
but all res@@ ist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough for a full explanation , and sometimes a context is required to understand exactly what is meant by that one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and Lingu@@ ist von &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog you can find example words from the Mw@@ ot@@ s@@ lap language of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ ü@@ h you for your parents in recognition of how you tried to endeav@@ or yourself in your younger years .
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik Language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi - The convenience or la@@ zin@@ ess that you feel after being s@@ worn in cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his Blog about :
&quot; they de@@ formation different cultures , reve@@ aling any other thought @-@ up and ar@@ ouse our new gi@@ er@@ de . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , as we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page still want to publish more of these &quot; in@@ estim@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; Red@@ ner of the &quot; &quot; Treasure Langu@@ ages &quot; , &quot; which are very appreciated by Un@@ transl@@ atable , are invited to upload their favorite labor . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is concerned with the worst Fl@@ ut@@ kat@@ disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently looking at the worst high @-@ water and dro@@ pping disaster in this decade .
&quot; fired by the mon@@ soon , which usually starts at the end of May , are characterized by strong ra@@ inf@@ alls the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country over the shore . &quot;
&quot; after an opinion of the disaster of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and Schl@@ amm@@ lau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; more than 400 000 people have been affected ( 26 May ) for the last Friday ( 26 May ) , and around 100 000 people were put to a safe place of residence . &quot;
&quot; the ra@@ inf@@ alls were left on Saturday ( 27th May ) , and the water pressure in some areas went slowly back . &quot;
health and hygiene needs are a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the Fl@@ ut@@ disaster disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water production up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the has@@ ht@@ ag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly alarm crisis wor@@ sen the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ des crisis , war@@ ns Save the Children , after further ra@@ inf@@ all are already on their way . &quot;
&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus stood in the flood , water stood up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da with G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the yesterday covered water p@@ eg@@ els of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Air Force has five aircraft available for b@@ ail@@ out actions , and further five are made for transport of emergency services for those in their floo@@ ded villages . &quot;
also various organizations and start @-@ ups have prepared themselves to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ o in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high @-@ water situation and humanitarian assistance .
&quot; if any search and b@@ ail@@ out threats are required for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
for those who want to be dry @-@ up foods and life @-@ necessary goods for high @-@ water @-@ offering -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ ach@@ ana .
&quot; please call it the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 7@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 , if animals in this area need help . &quot;
&quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share its location data with the help of the app , so that the Cat@@ ast@@ o centre is informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the catastrophe of the Tro@@ pen@@ storm Ro@@ an@@ u , P@@ Me led a &quot; &quot; high water supply &quot; &quot; button which allowed it to call it users to pick up a vehicle for picking up assistance and donations . these were then transmitted to the s@@ und@@ lan@@ k@@ ic R@@ ote cross . &quot;
&quot; likewise , they led a &quot; SOS &quot; button that had more than thousand requests and 150 successful merch@@ ant actions for floo@@ ding , and amaz@@ ingly closed people . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts by the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , residents need in need in need and provide assistance . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka now ends the long way to the recovery of norm@@ ality . &quot;

&quot; use authorized by Dam@@ als in January , I took part in Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor and dear girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; I trust her my four year old daughter , they trust me for her children ; she is my rock in the burnt . &quot;
in one minute we call for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ andi@@ st we are rights for trans@@ gender .
&quot; we are located in a sea of rain @-@ ear@@ ms and people , some consider the iconic picture of a woman with a to@@ wel , bound from a American flag , other sk@@ andi@@ st par@@ ols against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend look at me and says , &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I wonder . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I am working or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar who know it - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their concept . &quot;
you have mus@@ li@@ ze me .
there are 1.@@ 7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify to be Muslim to be Muslim to different kind . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim @-@ dra@@ wer .
&quot; this dra@@ wer is so well designed in our collective imagination such as soon as Muslims , who like I do not fit there . &quot;
Muslim must be li@@ zed
I stand with that not alone .
&quot; this is even to the poet , whose poetry in America is selling in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
which images come to a sense when one thinks of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i as old as I am now , he was a orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western conception , the religion of Rum@@ is were deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; this del@@ e@@ tion makes a great part of the history of the 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims of this world . &quot;
another one in the for@@ c@@ tion@@ ist paintings of Muslims , the Western books have been col@@ oni@@ ous for centuries . &quot;
this temp@@ ting picture language is determined by the dark man who should fear and the exotic wife you should save .
the pioneering Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid was cut down the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these images continue to stand forth today .
our politicians who continue the news media and Hollywood .
&quot; I &apos;ve worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , mis@@ informed Nar@@ r@@ atives domin@@ ate our news . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality , which in the last three decades , nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v failed to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and su@@ ck itch , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body which both are two sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this strong Nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ens mus@@ cular women , the movements for change . &quot;
&quot; it looks clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken to the American soil of Afri@@ cans , who were here brought here with slave ships . &quot;
it delet@@ es the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v has taken our collective imagination , such deep and mis@@ er@@ ous , that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children are exposed to the target of tim@@ us@@ tic attacks and chic@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the others . &quot;
1.@@ 7 billion belong
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just stories to tell who are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative that help us understand the world .
and my industry is mis@@ leading to grasp the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1.7 billion .
and here we have failed where seven million Muslims represent the highest degree of &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America .
more than one third of the Muslim population are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigration of the first generation coming from 77 countries .

four decades ago I arrived in New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother placed her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scrapers of New York ; sky@@ scrapers , characterised by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name of Faz@@ er Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; back then , when Khan started the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ embr@@ aced Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now un@@ um@@ f@@ aded Muslims and American ?
&quot; sometimes , if people ask me why I &apos;m not going to eat pig meat , I say - instead of my Muslim Reci@@ pes , or my hand@@ some pick@@ guard belonging to all Muslims with themselves - &quot; &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ iss@@ ors , we do not carry all T@@ ash@@ ans with us . &quot;
we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to always be selected for extra security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who strive to fight well @-@ spread lies over Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced at the current volume of a well @-@ based Islam@@ ist machinery with credit@@ ors , think tank and experts for mis@@ information which is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or of which Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , there is hyper@@ sensitivity to more than just a stran@@ ger that of a woman &apos;s sc@@ arf . &quot;

I want to explain that .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but a Muslim was born only then in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when soci@@ ologist describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behaviour and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ li@@ ers belief and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend would see my neighbour , my rock in the fire , that I am Muslim when they might look through the 15 feet concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
she would see the night@@ ly ritual with my daughter when I wi@@ pe them in my arms and her the Arab verses to protect the Quran and who are called the Quran and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them repeat three times .
&quot; I ask for them to be protected from the evil one , the evil one you can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief is not always visible , but my Muslim membership is always part of my shadow . &quot;

&quot; belonging to my grand@@ mother is the image of my grand@@ mother mat@@ ern@@ al , with her sisters ; how they can win a competition of the art of flowers in Kar@@ achi . &quot;
&quot; it is the picture of her , that I see my eyes asleep : Nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings , the painted Su@@ fi @-@ heal@@ er ; and a cor@@ k with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen chapters , which can be nearly off@@ beat . &quot;
&quot; Muslim means to be the prayers made she told me , when I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; Islam lies in therein , how she brought me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , is my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that was founded through centuries - by an &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; Col@@ oni@@ um , which has founded a company with the name of Ven@@ erable Bri@@ astic Ost@@ ini@@ dien company , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; belonging means to grow and listen to that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my first grandfather wept . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the modern Islam , he writes books about the modern Islam and about the independence K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , crying n@@ ana Ja@@ an un@@ um@@ w@@ ess around his family in India dominated K@@ ash@@ mir , family , that he was not allowed to close in his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to know that there are millions Kurds and Palestinians who have been torn apart from colon@@ ists , such as in my grandfather , of col@@ oni@@ alists , who have dealt with the Muslim world as at stake . &quot;
to be Muslims also means to know that during the last two centuries Europeans all have been gener@@ alised all the way to four Muslim countries .
&quot; it means to know that the first catch of the history of the history of a century , was turned down over a Muslim country . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an ins@@ ane , k@@ ash@@ mir of the British empire , was designated by the newspapers of his time as &quot; &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he was the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; before there was aircraft , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and pre@@ ached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; it means remember@@ ing that four@@ teen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops , who have gone over every continent apart from the Antarc@@ tica , who have gone to Iraq to chase the mass destruction of Mass Des@@ tru@@ ction . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ir@@ aker buried among the ruins of the war .
&quot; in 2001 , American Muslim means to know that the self @-@ mor@@ ant among veter@@ ans since 2001 has risen by more than 32 percent . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that if a tragedy carries out the US and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story of four times more reports than a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that four@@ teen thousand years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slaves called Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago a African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ l@@ aved and brought into this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X a American hero .
&quot; it is the heat that I sen@@ sed , when people filled the airports in order to fight against the Muslim B@@ an . &quot;
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; to be a Americ@@ an@@ ress , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Con@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim and a journalist , the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our with multiple identi@@ ties , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1,@@ 7 billion holds more possibilities than a mag@@ ician , but is represented in the reduced doubt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother , means to make my child care and all the Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged people er@@ ect on this two @-@ scale structural freedom . &quot;
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia lies in the Muslim govern@@ ors that joined President Bush and expanded under President Obama .
it consists of long @-@ term monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it exists in the immigration office , which takes a five @-@ year old child in hand cells . &quot;
&quot; it exists in a country that ends up its borders to people out of the countries , which it is bom@@ bed . &quot;
it is a false and neb@@ ul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ Fly @-@ list &quot; which is largely Arabs and Muslims in the sight .
they are the wars that we are carrying and the bom@@ bs which we have in Muslim countries .
&quot; because of the stories we tell and due to those that we do not tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study conducted by the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University participants a scientifically described image and pol@@ ates them , groups on a scale of 1 to 100 with regard to evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
contam@@ ination which we have to lead to
we have come to deeply dar@@ ing to circum@@ v@@ ise the Muslim or the &quot; other . &quot;
we stand back decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous training prints which we are in our message editors .
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims in the media industry , which tries to reconc@@ ile our frequently associated identity and forget history . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast lake Some@@ thing , S@@ ay Some@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the vir@@ cast Vide@@ os@@ erie of Buda ; Sap@@ elo Square over black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , multip@@ lies Muslim authors - all this makes me hope . &quot;

but I am worried because of this difficult global point where we are located .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.@@ 7 billion .
&quot; there is one reason for the conspir@@ ators , that existed in the dark corner of the internet , now the White House will lead . &quot;
&quot; they are exp@@ on@@ entially , because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ entially as it has created the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a few years previously , they had not yet given them ; now they master great areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am worried about the realities and history , which I was not aware of it as I was now my daughter , but who made me today about an ins@@ inu@@ ous Muslim . &quot;
things that I have left here like a bread@@ cru@@ m@@ track in my speech .
&quot; things which might ar@@ ouse memories , because in all the inter@@ sections which makes our humanity a story , where someone is made to one another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , contr@@ ain@@ dic@@ ations are held at the 8th annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; over a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; &quot; others &quot; , &quot; structural racism and &quot; &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell you this here with this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has been shown to us , how wars are led and people adher@@ ed to the idea of &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; in public idea , four decades ago scientist . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves un@@ convenient questions according to the role of this , consciously and consciously aware of the &quot; &quot; other &quot; , &quot; as it &apos;s my girlfriend and I in the rain during Women &apos;s March , because he has no President , the chocolate cake is eaten , while he has already broken lands and &quot; to other common &quot; people bombar@@ ded , it goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;
it starts with all of us .
initiative for nar@@ ration wants to preserve a variety of language
&quot; tell about , Flick@@ r @-@ User Daniele Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ N@@ D 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a possibility to join someone here and now in spite of a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the un@@ count of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird , the un@@ question@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of major cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land , where T@@ LS has conducted events for 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages could not be passed on to the children there . &quot;
for the creators of the project apply :
&quot; the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we manage cities to accept diversity - safe spaces , in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to rush . &quot;
&quot; listen often with it is related to understand &quot; &quot; forced these events instead &quot; to listen , to feel , to make . &quot;
in this format stor@@ yt@@ eller presents their story first in their own language and then explain them to English .
&quot; if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their devotion and depic@@ tion says that the audience will be in@@ quired about it . &quot;
they call laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video illustr@@ ates a traditional story of Burkina Faso , who speaks in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou con@@ ates also the opportunity to explain the typical customs of fiction for their land . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the fl@@ anges of the har@@ es and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zim@@ babwe :
&quot; after explaining the importance of his F@@ abel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is that to speak a audience who does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide dit@@ ch he shares his sense of inclusi@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened to !
you were attentive ...

Puerto Rico calls on the US re @-@ determination of the sovereign debts
&quot; the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took part in 72 million US dollars , took part in the 14th April 2017 various religious and civil society in a mass demonstration ; the march started at the captain Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the Old City of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; she was called by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ gi@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ ía de la D@@ eu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the re @-@ examination of the debt ) and the O@@ kom@@ en@@ ish church of Puerto Ri@@ cos . &quot;
the inter@@ c@@ essors of the re@@ vocation of debts have also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos calls for the politicians , bank@@ ers and government authorities who are responsible for debts , to be held responsible for their corrupt . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial review and a gui@@ del@@ al committee without personal interests in public debts , with a fixed , our working conditions , and the appropriate re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation that acts in favor of the economy . &quot;
we will pres@@ t and suppres@@ sed .
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refused to pay a debt that is not its .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be loaded with reduced retirement deposits .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the state @-@ of @-@ state territory of the USA - suff@@ ers under a severe economic crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a ruling @-@ independent non @-@ profit organisation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law for state @-@ responsibility before , as an alternative to existing state of state . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a wide range of restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; from the outside imposed action , without the participation and conviction of the citizen must be dangerous , rejected by the people . &quot;
the demonstration brought the name &quot; post @-@ ache for light and truth . &quot;

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web@@ developer bass player Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ ele Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives put the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : publi@@ ca , the annual conference of digital culture , which is focused in Berlin , devoted to an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a researcher who produced in France based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , leader of books within three to five days , las@@ hing excer@@ pts from the book C@@ ost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective re@@ research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book that has been published last year and contains a licence @-@ free , contains a series of attempts which deal with the free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ wood and his work .
in the introduction it is :
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what the real costs are , with which this is related . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who have worked in the movements for free knowledge , have worked side by side to cross over the fog that surround our News@@ fe@@ eds and to create some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free b@@ ass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and filmed Internet volunteers , who has been in@@ stituted in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was painted from the directory of the A@@ dra @-@ prison , where he was sitting on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
we have no information whatsoever on its current state or location .
&quot; the introduc@@ tory section of his book with the title coll@@ ectives , gives his friends and family a voice that will push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , namely immediately . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , has many of us start to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ates , acts and decisions . &quot;
why are we here ?
what did we choose ?
what have we abandoned in this process of temporary beliefs ?
the Web@@ developer for Open Source and Digital activ@@ ist has been in cust@@ ody Syrian government authorities for March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and Ombud@@ sper@@ son N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; &quot; Military Police boats &quot; &quot; were on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the Military Tribunal for his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported , she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who created themselves as the insi@@ der of the Assad government and put it in note of an alleged death kn@@ oll by her husband . &quot;
its location and condition remain unknown but remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , b@@ ass@@ el played a crucial role in finding access to internet and knowledge for the public sphere . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and temporary director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded the Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; maybe none of Bas@@ sels cultural prot@@ otypes were preced@@ ed than the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important arche@@ ological sites in the world , was the cross@@ road of numerous civi@@ lizations and here mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would put everything about it , this architecture that not only em@@ bo@@ died the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strip in digital arche@@ ology and preservation has created a time @-@ capsule , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; typically , b@@ ass@@ el of this project was not able to complete this project yet . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I have spent my whole life to dream of freedom , and Bass@@ a taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el brought me English at even when he was already in cust@@ ody .
&quot; I learned to read English well , write and talk . &quot;
&quot; he always has his knowledge with each who is asked . he taught others incar@@ cer@@ ated , English to read , write and talk . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened to me the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computer and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he has also taught others to others , as they use computers , at least theoretically that they actually held a hand in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a Pro@@ sab@@ uch , which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in cust@@ ody . &quot;
Bass@@ a and N@@ oura have worked together on the book for one year .
she put the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated her from the Arabic to English .
the book is license @-@ free available .

&quot; here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a , with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; : &quot;

&quot; that I lose the mind in the moment we embrace , &quot;

b@@ az@@ sels history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of 2011 protests against the regime of Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , more than 6@@ 5,000 people disappeared . &quot;
&quot; those who were arrested or dism@@ issed by the regime , were tor@@ tured or even executed . &quot;
&quot; until 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nest@@ y International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrian in prison . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ ele .
we reiter@@ ate our demand today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption de@@ for@@ ated Director after prison @-@ release again on previous post
&quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ que re@@ acted with anger on a corrupt attack , where a ruling member returned after half of his sentence on the work of the state apparatus , where corruption has been committed . &quot;
&quot; this is about Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ endants of 54 million Me@@ tics ( about 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the money was from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose Council Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and now called for its re @-@ setting up into the company which took place on 19 April then .
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the General Staff pro@@ secution in the Republic , there would be no barriers to Cam@@ b@@ aza to go back to his old post as the company was not a lack of discipline . &quot;
&quot; however , many people are not doing the action well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , shortly C@@ IP ) , a local institution that stands for public transparency , distributed in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the firm , the director again : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption , and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a set@@ back with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we need to know is that the company should have a lack of discipl@@ in@@ procedures against the res@@ ign@@ ation .
&quot; however , the company itself , however , and promp@@ ted no proper legal steps to use the appropriate functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the mos@@ ambi@@ can social media , also reject this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; &quot; res@@ ili@@ ent &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type , he would be consultant after he was sentenced to a sentence , and that half has been rep@@ ented . &quot;
&quot; he could keep lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could consult and to raise his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to become re@@ integrated into the company which he helped harm . &quot;
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly be paid for his silence .
disgu@@ sting !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ kings , young Moz@@ ambi@@ ance and student of political science in Brazil says , the director had no morality . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza get rewarded by the state , because he defended him , I can &apos;t believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that the state has already been insul@@ ted so massive . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing to return moral and serve the state , * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead it is only served by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state , as hand@@ ele it has become an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money source , and the state itself has become tired , pre@@ loaded and ultimately sentenced to a long term sentence . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , I do not know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mak@@ el , to remind you that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ iev@@ es are part of the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , the Moz@@ ambi@@ ente is not only remembered as the first independent president but also as a sharp , spir@@ ited and - by saying - proph@@ etic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was , when he confirmed energetic , that &quot; an ambitious person is mainly capable of sell also the f@@ ather@@ land for its ambitions , his own individual interest to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora said also : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an un@@ committed man changes , my experience indicates that it is not so . he does not change the tactics but he does not turn away from his ambitions . &quot;
a ambitious human is also criminal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also con@@ spic@@ uous :
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years old and came free . &quot;
&quot; and today it is set up the company , in which he de@@ duc@@ er the money , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ tells ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017 , &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and c@@ ens@@ ored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or Sp@@ ital@@ b@@ se .
photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their po@@ sts out of the network , because it contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin or generally use as an adj@@ ective . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook c@@ ens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese font ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
in recent years the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements of the word has given an extremely rep@@ utable con@@ notation .
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight real @-@ language in Myanmar , the company has c@@ ens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar is usually associated with racism , but the word itself does not appear to be an automatic language . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that po@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about the purpose of his use . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there are several bur@@ ial words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , stool is written on Bur@@ m@@ isch also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ altern@@ ate ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( v@@ eil ) or &apos; cal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ ebook@@ useless A@@ ung Ka@@ at stated the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends on a spiritual nature whether she knew how he could so@@ ften his back pain , by doing a word . &quot;
&quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the Fr@@ age@@ word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ isch - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; zin Win H@@ oses is the opinion that they will reduce hate @-@ radic@@ ally nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ised that Facebook may be analytical needs , before it all po@@ sts lion , which spread in suspic@@ ion , racism . &quot;
Facebook delet@@ es the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; out manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the automation will not understand what you must read on &quot; &quot; Fac@@ be@@ ook &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; what it should be done instead is to analyse the mail carefully and control it by checking the words standing . &quot;
&quot; for example &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; &quot; ( split ) . &quot;
&quot; the good is that these three @-@ legged nation@@ alists , the oral language are spreading , a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circum@@ cis@@ ed its nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all the oral language , the efficiency of this strategy may not last for long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often gets a kitt@@ ens and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks will just start to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung appe@@ als to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends only that the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook , I made a post office to share my Facebook @-@ friends , that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited the Li@@ ken , post and parts of content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; &quot; Facebook community standards did not meet . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate radi@@ al nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his mail has been removed which has nothing to do with hate speech :
mail without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post the author shared his opinion of why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook would have more to do at the beginning of the initiative - for example the Bur@@ m@@ ian Internet community about advice :
&quot; Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to decrease racism in Burma by their platform , but it doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
to draw up such words will only bring hat@@ red among the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started it without local context or technical support and have banned as &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; P@@ ush@@ curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they have made mistakes they tried not to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied po@@ sts .
&quot; if only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they have achieved , that would give them great sales , would be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has been given for a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
&quot; rather than take it seriously , users are now funny and writing the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate language to see if their po@@ sts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook &apos;s posts , which did not contain any discussion , but nevertheless removed : &quot;
with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ical text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and have an inheritance to an Indian film .
just to try out if Facebook contains the mail that contains the word Kal@@ ar .
screens@@ hot with permission .
&quot; the post says &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal humans ? &quot;
screens@@ hot with permission .
&quot; over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used to have used social networks in order to increase their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should lead the violence in Myanmar in addition to secre@@ tly , particularly in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced thousands of escape . &quot;
Facebook was critic@@ ised for his failure to criti@@ ci@@ ze the fu@@ cking H@@ ass on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sites under control .
&quot; instead of simply going to c@@ ze the word &apos; cal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at the context rather than code concentrated initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trin@@ id@@ ad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is at the end with the to@@ e deer
a wedding ring in the sand .

the inf@@ usion is now illegal in Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted in the unanim@@ ously a law which has to offer this practice , so that the child @-@ host is now at the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change of the sp@@ ouses held some members ou@@ trag@@ eous and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the inter @-@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group , the representatives of the various religious groups of the country , that the state does not inter@@ fere with that the state is not to the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened irrespective of the fact that Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN &apos;s rights law , the min@@ ors as , is defined every man under 18 years . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children , who were married to 15 , in Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago 2.7 % , and with 18 were 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Statisti@@ cal Office of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 . &quot;
&quot; online Peti@@ tions and Social @-@ Media @-@ movements that have been eager to prevent La@@ ws to inf@@ usion , followed at the foot and present themselves with great support . undoubtedly , they help to bring about this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Hin@@ du @-@ leader Z. B. had no concerns to say the critics of the children , they ought , they don &apos;t even take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition were bother@@ ed for tensions in this actually un@@ complicated affair , and at some point there were doubts on whether the opposition would agree to the draft law . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the law was decided against the children before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which could include , so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where an easy majority would make him into the law . &quot;
now only the President of the country has to agree and announce the law .
&quot; one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave us a status update , which Re@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram again : &quot;
&quot; Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the law@@ suit against the children , was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no single one on it . &quot;
&quot; after being decided in the Senate , the design can now become the law . &quot;
&quot; the majority of the social media users were excited , because the laws had finally been changed to children . &quot;
&quot; Facebook @-@ member Lov@@ ell Francis , who em@@ bo@@ ar@@ ate the Department of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has taken too much time and unnecessary bar@@ ge which did the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children deer are illegal in Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago now , and this is almost every price . &quot;
&quot; while A@@ bel Jackson of mind was , it was definitely long enough to lay down the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come : &quot;
&quot; public Status update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which h@@ ates : , , outstanding news ! &quot;
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; follow Mut@@ ota , belonging to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group which openly spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law was re@@ marked : &quot;
the hei@@ r@@ ats@@ capable age in Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religion than 18 years .
&quot; the draft to change the sp@@ ouses was announced today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 members and there were 35 at present . &quot;
&quot; all Members who were against , have voted for the law . &quot;
the to@@ e deer are legally not allowed in Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ r@@ age@@ c@@ ild@@ hood .
many thanks to all activists who have challenged him .
Con@@ gr@@ ats .
a thank you to our MEPs .
&quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj so , the Secretary General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du @-@ organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; ahead of months Mahar@@ aj has announced its intention to take judicial steps that the law should be passed , and he seems to rede@@ em his promise . &quot;
&quot; during the Direc@@ tor@@ ney @-@ General Al ra@@ wi , an advocate of the law , it would be quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wants to go against the law , the majority of social media users would like to address the debate about the issue . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed :
&quot; dear Sat , If we , instead of telling the discussion so generally , in a way that only panic and im@@ purity can be highlighted that the state , our daughters are protecting that they may be of great , hard @-@ hard men who are faced with them , would you then ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it is now coming to an judicial procedure against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children are legal or still the norm , although there is laws which they say . &quot;

&quot; the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was contrary to the SO@@ PA ( stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copy@@ rights , represented in the USA , internationally . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey has pushed the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enzy@@ mes Wikipedia Wikipedia .
&quot; day after day becomes more evident , how important the platform for users to find helpful and reliable information to find and to share . &quot;
both students and re@@ por@@ ters and fans of TV @-@ series are against the blocking .
&quot; although many techni@@ c @-@ vers@@ ed Internet users are used to use str@@ apping tools for block web pages ( a current article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VP@@ N prevalence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users will not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been approved by Wikipedia , like recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been taking place , finding regular block@@ ages of the internet since 2007 , after the Internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the two most famous country in the world when it comes to massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship from Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to be locked , now there are several Mir@@ ror@@ sites ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform rel@@ ies all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( thus machine @-@ PC connections ) , which does not make itself on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult . &quot;
the content is despite statutory ban but available .
in a blog@@ post J@@ FS tells about his efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the news ( on the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put it all on it , snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility of reading the content on de@@ centralized and distributed manner . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to access at least all Wikipedia content , even if they do not have access to the website www.@@ new@@ s@@ itself . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS was also granted that this step is independent of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is just about screen@@ shots and not a Live@@ or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Vi@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to get the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror@@ site from Wikipedia , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mir@@ ror@@ sites when in the respective country Wikipedia is locked . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as employees in Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror . &quot;
&quot; one moves to another URL , which is not the original . that what you see is from Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; essentially , the server introduces the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia ourselves then when they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

with permission .
&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos , which he looked around him , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with poor@@ er moti@@ fs and mature colors . &quot;
the motivated set itself gives him a camera to carry and try to walk the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , attempts to bring him to the international stage by Sag@@ ar , Nep@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; and his home place right beside the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering it the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nep@@ als wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook as he helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photography ! !
I just arrived at home when I suddenly called Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had a call from my Father that was on the shore of the Rap@@ ti river a leop@@ ard .
the ri@@ f@@ dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran out with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father had watched it and showed me the place on the other river , where the leop@@ ard was and I immediately started to cr@@ ush pictures ! ! &quot;
&quot; Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to work with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nepal as a nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so fright@@ ening , as they look like . &quot;
&quot; and he should know it , for he was standing in face to face , face to face : &quot;
a tiger can not be up@@ set by the opinion of the sheep not at bed@@ time ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleep @-@ time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also , because of the darkness was on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ ast@@ ern@@ ess appeared . he immediately sat down , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I cli@@ cked for Environmental Protection ) in his photos . &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als and wildlife is not always easy .
&quot; he waited 22 days long , and lived mostly in a tent to make in the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days lasted until he took a Tiger , six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation . &quot;
take a look at some of these photos .

&quot; this article was written by Kay@@ ona@@ az Kaly@@ m@@ wal@@ a and was originally written to Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing Convention .
&quot; in many parts of India , there are women with great care to speak the names of their sp@@ ouses , or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pr@@ on@@ oun or say &quot; Father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ t@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh give women to respect that they respect the social pressure to respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences they should abuse the norm . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned by the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a shot and consul@@ ted by her family and the village community after they had stopped their name . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives also did not name the name , is also widespread amongst men . however , they have far fewer support for fear , if at all , they should not fail to this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health care and house@@ wives , a unique club and became the main @-@ lined topic of the city . &quot;
it is a place just for them to discuss and discuss the int@@ ric@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that exists in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and supports the reduction in the patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; for seven years , Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was working for seven years with the help of her video camera to un@@ cover practices , such as children &apos;s heating up to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ In@@ infected , and manages this clubs . &quot;
they told about how this clubs created a safe place for these women and have made them simultaneously a amb@@ assador for change .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini was pointed out in its panel , was the women of women who did not name their sp@@ ouses . &quot;
&quot; it has decided for this topic , because it wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify . &quot;
they don &apos;t speak al@@ oud the name of their sp@@ ouses is a bread which they all maintained and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fied that a woman respected her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not rede@@ em this , is considered a rear @-@ term as a woman without morality . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never had thought of so far to this discussion .
&quot; beginning wanted to be Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband at home before , at home as it works . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband disp@@ ens@@ ed a long time , after the video was at the end . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ ak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I was to call him on his name . &quot;
with this confidence in the luggage launched Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; nor ever before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ t@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh .
&quot; after the video projection , the women who tried to bring discussion with an exercise in motion . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different emotions - happy , aff@@ lic@@ ted , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all that &quot; &quot; If we cannot say the name of our sp@@ ouses , but they can call us how they want it means that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her sp@@ ouses over her lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was out of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in the married women never allowed the name of their sp@@ ouses . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; a woman was so shy that she was going on during the entire exercise , and another decided to let the whole an@@ ed fru@@ stration for him and his family by going to cur@@ se him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ek@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; in the adren@@ alin exchange , having broken with an ancient brass , the women decided that they would actually attempt home to name their sp@@ ouses in the name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
&quot; the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put in his head , his wife could not stop his name . &quot;
another club @-@ member chose to do it during dinner in front of the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she went up , she was afraid and said that there was an error . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I meant to do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation emerged in force .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as carrying out the galvan@@ ic red point on the forehead , which shows the wed@@ ability : &quot;
why do women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would bear the galvan@@ ic point if he did . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I heard on wearing it .
&quot; the other women were not fully owned , but mean , they are now in a better position to choose for themselves , to do not bear it on some days . &quot;
for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can replace their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we do a trip on each discussion . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to make the women worry about who could hear what could hear , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; during the last months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and spoke and spoke about things , that they had never done before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years now and I have also talked about some things , for example like our identi@@ ties to our sp@@ ouses , never honestly speaking . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things noisy , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothing .
some women in the group have played just sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most is the al@@ right , but some wanted a sal@@ ine Kur@@ ta , a long shirt over a p@@ ants , wearing ; they have not drunk . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of contro@@ versy and discussion about the mer@@ its of their own clos@@ ets , mor@@ als connected with the sar@@ is and much more , decor@@ ate &apos;s own pair of Kur@@ dish ( upper hem@@ ati@@ zed ) into a discussion round , so that the women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they can create it . &quot;
&quot; in question , whether in the five months since their first discussion club has changed something , Roh@@ ini , that things are slowly coming into roles : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but listened to the name of their sp@@ ouses . &quot;
&quot; some of me included , make it yet , but only if they are alone and are not members of the family members . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their sp@@ ouses ; only one or two women carry now at every time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ he@@ y on their forehead .
women in the discussion club will know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the sm@@ ug@@ gle for more freedom of movement or their own clothes - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river .
&quot; by giving each other self confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini says :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
&quot; but this pru@@ dent gives each of us the confidence that is going to change . &quot;
&quot; and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction , when every woman goes back home and told other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing . &quot;
we are all sitting in the same boat .

&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of gl@@ az@@ ed people for organization trading , probably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , presum@@ ably the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the intern@@ k . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the Mil@@ k district , few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims had been revealed and a part of the organs have been extrac@@ ted .
&quot; two men have been arrested and reported in the episode , that the organs of Sham@@ ans are used in Tanzania and Malawi . &quot;
&quot; it will give the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a male member man could bring gold un@@ old or wealth , the pol@@ z@@ eis@@ pre@@ cher was declared by Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia &apos;s BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that en@@ umer@@ ating attacks on gl@@ acial men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group that is the aim of investig@@ ators for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
&quot; this led to the fact that the UN launched a mission in the South African country in order to examine these intern@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania where the government developed campaigns to believe these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ com@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ uto .
he warned those who are planning to travel to the land :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who are traveling to Moz@@ ambi@@ que are the aim of ritu@@ alistic attacks , warned the mos@@ ambi@@ que police after the latest investigations of three smooth flow men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the Mil@@ ange district , where the investig@@ ators were arrested . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Ad@@ amo , Student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ b@@ ane in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , said that the local police have already broken : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sh@@ am@@ ans are involved in the death of the unbeliev@@ ing men .
&quot; the persecution and ass@@ ass@@ ination of gl@@ az@@ ed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , for probably super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has taken into consideration the police of the Republic of Moz@@ ambi@@ que ( PR@@ M ) , which also existed among the victims of the Republic of Moz@@ ambi@@ que ( PR@@ M ) , according to which the victims of the head would have power , the rich@@ es of rich@@ es . &quot;
in recent days three men were mur@@ dered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
&quot; Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Saman@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blog@@ gers of Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a , the indicated that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty in which mos@@ ambi@@ que faces : &quot;
&quot; I would like to say E@@ IN Moz@@ ambi@@ que , TH@@ AT S@@ IC@@ H ash@@ amed a country in which the teachers would seem to go on the road , and others wouldn &apos;t harm or even their lives to get their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os still k@@ ah@@ le or smooth@@ y for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; that aim to move to quicker wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some have the opportunity for mak@@ ab@@ ren humor . &quot;

&quot; a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which probably was recently done . &quot;
this story was originally published on 8th July 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the Chinese Dis@@ si@@ fied Chinese Dis@@ si@@ o Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o joined the international community , after being announced at the end of June , that he had been introduced to hospital for liver cancer . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years of prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state of charge ) , after the draft of the Charter of 08 , a Mani@@ fes@@ to , which was requ@@ esting democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to as &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; and tells a speaker , he said it as &quot; not required to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China still receives views from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , release or give it a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely out of the issue . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has been combined some reactions from abroad .
united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ Hussein al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese official to discuss the fall of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a speaker rejected it to comment whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad . &quot;
Norway
&quot; Norwegian Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Secretary of B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ing have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release . &quot;
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway was gr@@ ated in Sto@@ cks , after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government did not agree that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations have only been continued in December last year . only in June , Norway , signed an agreement to resume the black@@ outs and exports to China , since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; having been spreading the message that Li@@ u had seriously fallen ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope for an unconditional release to an unconditional release and lu@@ d Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his det@@ ention , he was not able to take his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision in which China was asked to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance , where he wants . &quot;

&quot; the invitation of the US Embassy drawn up an angry response from China to itself , with the utter@@ ance of the State Department , that &quot; no country has the right to inter@@ fere and ir@@ responsible comments about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Poll@@ ey shared with that China should offer the couple :
&quot; protection and freedom such as free movement and access to medical care of its choice , to which they are entitled to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Mer@@ kl@@ ey and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to release the Chinese government on it , Li@@ u and his wife uncondi@@ tionally . &quot;
&quot; I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o uncondi@@ tionally so that he can enter into a proper medical treatment . http : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o &quot;

&quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steff@@ en Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u gave all the medical support he needed , and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese president Xi Jin@@ ping was issued on July 7th and 8th at the G@@ 20 Summit in Hamburg .
&quot; earlier diplomatic sources in Beijing of the news Agency Reu@@ ters , that China had great concerns , whether the vor@@ tex um Li@@ u could give the visit to Hamburg . &quot;

&quot; Li@@ us An@@ walt told AF@@ P before , that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police are always watching the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed with someone outside , including his lawyers , to talk and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells you :
&quot; Canada calls upon China to release his international human rights violations , including freedom of opinion , to preserve and release the exercise of these rights to the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France
France &apos;s Secretary of France called on 29 June to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o will receive all treatments that he needs , independently where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family can have contact with him . &quot;

&quot; personally I felt very moved and also encouraged , when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the charter that signed up for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; the question may seem sil@@ ly , as Singapore is recognized at the international level as an independent state . &quot;
&quot; however , according to the Minister Minister K. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , Singapore should be considered to be a city . &quot;
this observation has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osph@@ ere .
&quot; during the meeting at a meeting of the international branch of the Law@@ yers &quot; Association of the State of New York , the Ministers affirmed that many people criti@@ ci@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because they are compared with other countries . &quot;
suppor@@ ter that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o described the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; the logic to rot@@ ate &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise in power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ es to create this valuable land , we must say that we are not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the sem@@ bl@@ ance of a flight from the responsibilities , a breach . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons for Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which the political system of Singapore could not compete with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , given what he appeared to be in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he has defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the cru@@ x of the subject , the good old Lei@@ er appears from the author@@ itarian rulers of defending Democrats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic , since it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end , during the last week of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am gave answers to his American guests about our press , our Ju@@ di@@ atives , our political system really non @-@ response . &quot;
corresponding questions tar@@ den@@ ters with non @-@ responses
Rachel Z@@ eng demands Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am to illustrate his opinion since they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; when Singapore is not a country , but a city is , thus to which country belongs to our town ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ner K Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take the trouble to resolve this point , if he was paid back to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by pointing on the blog posts his comment , he pointed out to read the cri@@ tic of the conference so that the context of the statements of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am can better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , according to which Singapore was a city and no country . &quot;
read the in@@ scription .
&quot; he told that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he stated why elections in Singapore are so un@@ equally important even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he incar@@ n@@ ate Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw for decades a party ? ) .
&quot; as he said , &quot; Singapore &quot; is not a country , &quot; he obviously does not mean in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ ement T@@ an illustr@@ ates his disappointment about Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who as a leader of a her@@ ed generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement . &quot;
&quot; I am concerning what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said , ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew by Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , what I expected - be I with them or not , but that is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , a member of the new generation of political leaders from Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it right and he &apos;s aware what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review sc@@ oring the w@@ aking of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ ams arguments :
did Mr. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; credited for a mistake &quot; or was it a mis@@ ud@@ der teacher ?
&quot; when Singapore is not a country , we are only treated as independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , in which country the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city . &quot;
&quot; since he plays an important role within the government , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am are very important . &quot;
&quot; why do the Singapore marks their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
who has to pay our Prime Minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink firm ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; origin@@ ates the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , and was always one city : &quot;
&quot; I did not say , what I said ... &quot;
this phrase seems to have den@@ o@@ unced a lot of Lon@@ er ...
&quot; no one has ever said that Singapore is a country . &quot;
we always were a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; defense of the country above all &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite true . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Fl@@ anders .
screens@@ hot of a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home country home ?
&quot; their answers are being published here as part of a continuous range , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world being exposed and another fac@@ et should be shown . &quot;
&quot; the newest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question which is being asked me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ?
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation that takes place , it is considered a pol@@ itely to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by putting personal questions . &quot;
&quot; clearly the basic answer follows then mostly the default response : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ck@@ ey , Nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans can perhaps be held war@@ dly before W@@ ut if they are held for Americans , but me does not distur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans of Americans . &quot;
&quot; this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans have a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack , if they &apos;re travelling . &quot;
all dear Can@@ adi@@ ans .
American on the other hand ... .
&quot; it was like I began 20 years ago when I began to travel through the world - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the march in Iraq and the 11th of September . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always worn small map@@ pers to their baggage to differenti@@ ate itself from its American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
for us there is no weapons !
gender @-@ gender equality have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we apparently say very often &quot; ap@@ ology . &quot;
Canada is supposedly regarded as the toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , which I enjoyed very much . &quot;
I would make no account for me if I would be confused with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; firstly : as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; to be referred to - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but typically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ son &quot; ( which has its own Canadian double ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing that you can encounter . &quot;
&quot; being harmless , means un@@ ob@@ tr@@ usive and un@@ interesting and no attention to deserve . &quot;
&quot; this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that may happen around . &quot;
&quot; I would even go if so far , to say that the desire to be free and alone , a leading part of Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; what out@@ standing as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps simply cooler courtesy . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
&quot; we are lacking the warm , open friendliness that I share with my American friends . &quot;
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then J@@ ustin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has almost made Canada straight .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ance Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop @-@ band has released a music video that has par@@ odi@@ c the Jun@@ ta , which will be re@@ directed in the power and in spite of their promise , the civil government , continues to re@@ igns the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) the Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells of what manner makes him his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; although not explicitly politically , the music video still refers to the continued military domination of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video of the song was a great success .
&quot; within the first three days , this was divided on Facebook up@@ loaded video 1,@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin @-@ Video , &quot; &quot; the dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists representing the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular , as it beh@@ aves with the position of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
take a look at these recordings of the video that refer to some of the political topics that Thailand has been retained in the past three years .
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may possibly refer to the dr@@ ak@@ onic section 44 of the provisional Constitution , which has an absolute decision @-@ making head@@ board , which is an important national subject . &quot;
&quot; 11 . rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for the &quot; &quot; change &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are regarded by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law of computer crime against , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often exploited by the authorities in order to sur@@ pass activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit in the army was also established , monitors and persons who were thrown , the monarchy is dec@@ eased to have been prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand continues a stri@@ fe against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ est@@ ay ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war was declared war in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it was a coup d of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that follow the Jun@@ ta is continuing to buy expensive sub@@ boats , although safety experts warn them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video will even show how people are thrown into a black supply carriage , before they bring it into an interval , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists sit in prison , because they have supposedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society , and Internet users are pregnant for a long time of rest , should they off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song members of the band , which had been im@@ ited the o@@ ut out of &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; , &quot; which has already been used by put@@ sch @-@ opponents during protests in 2014 . &quot;

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war company recovered very slowly in East @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ k@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it has now passed over 20 years since the Georgian war was officially ending , but his sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive pictures .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbon &apos;s of f@@ antasi@@ es . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , f@@ antasi@@ es , Geor@@ gier and Armen@@ ians have lived and worked on Soviet @-@ times in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , the largest part of the Russian and ch@@ ases are living in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called in Ab@@ ch@@ asia as well .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here today , there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost cities . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; for 2011 , the total population of the district 16@@ ,000 people had barely ever risen over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 43.@@ 000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ chen@@ h@@ kov@@ kas are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are isolated and very rarely they are occupied by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly .
he starts a conversation and it is hard to end this .
&quot; it all is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is still clear . &quot;
in front of war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens that di@@ vul@@ tures all of the community . &quot;
now there are only paved road with infl@@ atable glory @-@ buildings .
people who once lived in this place and contributed their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha approximately fifty inhabitants .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ov@@ kas , which are still one or two families , one recogni@@ zes at the balconies where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately move away . &quot;
&quot; our mother is allowed us to photograph us , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it simply has it forbidden , that is all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers of her girlfriend something to and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and van@@ ish .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the Sub@@ si@@ sten@@ cy ( cultivation of land products for the personal needs ) such as zo@@ ot@@ echni@@ cs , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable production . &quot;
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
the district administration supplies free candles and bread to the villages in the winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ c@@ chini &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago , an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ el@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not aband@@ on Ab@@ ch@@ ea to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in f@@ antasi@@ es , &quot; she tells them . &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to accept financial help from her daughter and insist on that she also supports their young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden or house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; gives them too . &quot;

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are we visit us .
&quot; but we cannot do so - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neigh@@ bor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ asch@@ a &quot; , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ alya her to . &quot; they said we could build Zu@@ c@@ chini . &quot;
I already prepared the ground .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
one can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; indeed , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was little work and everyone lived as it was right .
every day I remember how the city and war were once .
&quot; as our conversation comes to the end , a little boy stood by us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy he h@@ unted to him .
&quot; he plays with the ball , who then scroll down the hill . &quot;
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones on the falling buildings . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are part of their childhood , who care for integrity in their lives . &quot;
you do not know it any other way .

&quot; on the way of migrants , the Europe or Latin America cross , some places for their hospitality will be announced . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border with Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is run by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ erin , a small woman with a cor@@ als with a cor@@ als and gold @-@ coloured ear@@ rings in Ted@@ dy@@ b@@ ären @-@ shape . &quot;
&quot; it is called Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and grew up in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , yet they know many under the name of Mama Africa . &quot;
this nickname is the fact trained that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tian &apos;s who are on the journey .
the hotel does not have any charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 Dollar per night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with k@@ ills , m@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and local immigrants arrive here .
sometimes Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept on cardboard boxes . &quot;
it would like to reject nobody .
&quot; they also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy them medications that they can not pay them , they mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ sam that de@@ pl@@ eted by the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , is arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if her mother is a proper nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ d@@ sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; answers he with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her as African women are very nice women . &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister that hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
&quot; you have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normally a first stop in South America and then move toward the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other letters of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well known name on the track , &quot; explained Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tian and Afri@@ cans often go along the track and that the Afri@@ cans already speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
how many of his membership guides Michel@@ et previously in Brazil and worked as a buil@@ ders on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football world championship .
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his trip to the United States . &quot;
&quot; he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months now : he s@@ ells SI@@ M cards to save the necessary money to buy the acou@@ sti@@ cket after Ti@@ juana . &quot;
I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; answers , smiling . &quot; we will always keep in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that their guests will often send text messages if they have continued to gr@@ ate them or to tell her about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian belief in the drive of her work is .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her to prepare their chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known but she is not the only radio hope for migrants that travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city there is a dead end to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
we have recorded this winter in Valencia and its family migrants in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the B@@ usti@@ ckets have to be sold to numerous African migrants .
&quot; he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for a dollar spent the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment are 25 people there , mainly Hai@@ tian . &quot;
&quot; some sleeping up on blankets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cook@@ ery outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explained that he knows what our guests go through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was transferred to a raid on his work place from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , and other residents also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to press money from him without a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he has asked for an accommodation and a unknown , a single one @-@ driver , has offered him its roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family lives still there and they try to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests .
in the courses the passengers consult its teleph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought about 20 new guests , most of them from Somalia . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full but she &apos;s also a stal@@ gic to go because of those who have gone .
as a proud grand@@ mother she bore her in her album with a lot of pictures .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with an African hair fl@@ ap that her has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and Old . &quot;
they lau@@ gh so while they pret@@ end to me briefly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; she repeated every time . &quot; you have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
a check @-@ Point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter @-@ Users may be put in the ceremony .
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in the west of China are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile users at the Ti@@ an@@ shan District of the city of Uru@@ m@@ qi , received a cell aler@@ ts in which it indicates the District government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message is said that the app &quot; &quot; prevent access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , in col@@ on , the authorities continue to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were reported in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they had been installed shortly after they had exchanged the app , messages with a private group chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police , the app would identify and pursue the sources and distribution paths of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a service capacity with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ ph@@ u Tel@@ ecom . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block of porno@@ graphic websites , from online sc@@ am , tro@@ ugh@@ s and ph@@ ishing pages to make users care about how much time they spend online , and to remote your home network . &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can of course be used in a variety of ways .
&quot; for instance , the &quot; remote &quot; state actors or even h@@ ackers can be able to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or ste@@ al it . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to take control of digital activities in this region .
&quot; while announ@@ cements of digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China most often focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , rel@@ o@@ ed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme conditions and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ ental Internet shut@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; this published on Twitter @-@ based media out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( by inviting ) , the zen@@ zed news in China displayed , showed photos of a check@@ point , on the polic@@ emen as a result of veri@@ fying if they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ano make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile review required that people are installing the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; they have comp@@ elled the people to use devices , which are meant for older people . &quot;
this is a form of imprisonment through the rest of the world .
we are back in ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( sp@@ inning ) , is also published a j@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , out of which the software can lift the passwords up of a Windows operating system and gets un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computer and cell@@ phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are possibly a reaction to the instructions of the city @-@ party Council to minimize the spread of illegal content .
&quot; all governance , public authorities and the associated institutions , including universities and research institutes are oblig@@ ated to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security office when operating their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current report of Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned this new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the Regional Capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi a Regulation with the statement to all residents and ent@@ repr@@ en@@ eur who register their &quot; personal ID @-@ cards , mobil@@ es , external drives , portable hard@@ disk drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; with local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is evident to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; , however , this action is infring@@ ing the personality rights of Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and they pen@@ alties for quite a number of other possible susp@@ ending rates , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
sleep or death ; part 1 : all scre@@ ened after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; , &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane is depic@@ ted his experience in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at and show you that you are completely alone on a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually been solved and a truth reveals , which is clearly recognizable from both inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes her name all glory .
one that has be@@ aten up in a list of feelings and expressions who has no met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when you see the reality again and you are looking after the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performers - turn down the characters into being made of flesh and blood , and all sh@@ outing after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts solve in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even though the earth is placed on the axis of the in@@ hei@@ r . you realize that you &apos;re caught up here between the walls , the your parents , and before them your grandparents , stone by stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but we have not yet received my lesson , as the chief of the safety officer , I formulated it with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he presented his power over us as demonstrated by even the simpl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were torn away during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds from the beautiful gardens of our revolution .
&quot; it has been ra@@ ined , so that the city of the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; Al@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; scre@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; all town districts , just my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , un@@ ra@@ ining , at the wrong time , even if I found no high demands on a city that is up to the arter@@ ies with state safety and their ac@@ compli@@ ce . &quot;
during the third night the things had a cal@@ med down after the power supply in the quarter was stopped .
&quot; I trans@@ broke the silence , by calling several times &quot; &quot; Al@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; from my house @-@ ach . &quot;
I heard my voice caused by the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt cour@@ ageous enough to come together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we were talking to a wonderful picture , which met my expectations fully and completely fulfilled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you realize that you are fre@@ ed the spirit from the lamp , but it is just not interested in the ing@@ one . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; makes you ready to meet with the military security office . &quot;
he placed on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low your voice , after you have pushed them all the way up to the office of the safety service out of the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
&quot; the th@@ st Gh@@ assan stood there with several of his men , and my father was already there as I am now . &quot;
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ assan starts to speak , &quot; &quot; let me hear , how to listen to &quot; Al@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough to cry out if we are not nearby . &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ ted eyes were looking forward to me .
and you don &apos;t have to look at your eyes and not on the ground !
&quot; what I did , has nothing to do with courage . &quot;
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity ; perhaps at the revolution . &quot;
&quot; for me , I was so sure when I answered , &quot; I didn &apos;t think that you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; I think I have never stopped to look at your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in sol@@ itary , and his father straight away with it . &quot;
&quot; his father is identical to that . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this hiding place is up to me now in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a se@@ el@@ ian torture , which I was exposed for months . &quot;
I sh@@ utter@@ ed the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
&quot; after that , through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a course to the individual cells . &quot;
&quot; I pre@@ ach all the details exactly , before I super@@ v@@ ise the space . &quot;
otherwise but otherwise they were probably shared with a larger cell .
&quot; I have to share it with only one other det@@ ain@@ ly , and immediately must put me up , without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes they felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I laid back on an old proven communication method : with the f@@ ist to beat the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my tin @-@ fin was a &quot; &quot; y@@ sth@@ at@@ ant &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he answered me ultimately .
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells was a well @-@ known man middle aged man , who sees me similar and called &quot; doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness , no striking coun@@ ties can be seen to me , and doctors are here not ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot;
all the answers are connected to its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the major cells .
perhaps he will be stopped immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had insured me , she would fre@@ il@@ ate him when I stay . &quot;
fan .
&quot; I would like to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to prop@@ el all these cl@@ aws , which lab@@ yrinth to the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from a distance , I still hear them &quot; &quot; Al@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it needs to be about 10 am in the evening ; always at this time the hor@@ rors , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that Black saw the color of the dec@@ ay until I saw the gray light , which presented us the di@@ gest in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; reference to the 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
&quot; they are here , to be h@@ ears . &quot;
&quot; it was also secret : to protect the state security in front of us and to prevent the tra@@ it@@ ant and the terrorists in us , they talk in al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - hence they played their con@@ fes@@ sions and watched the narrow ey@@ es@@ field of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is here is not a land ; it is a cur@@ se that call it co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their cl@@ ans into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I super@@ vised the hear@@ ken@@ ed and tre@@ ach to Abu I@@ mad , a slim and stupid man ; at least he appears to me so . &quot;
&quot; he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that came to him , &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can join as much more important things as you join this meeting and to protest on demonstrations that will be found anyway . &quot;
I rep@@ lied .
I got it acc@@ ust@@ omed to not to answer .
I can really no longer say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become a friendly dialogue for me to an ordinary communication means .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said , that I had to be pun@@ ished or be@@ amed to be pun@@ ished , although I had done nothing to earn these punishment . &quot;
at punishment in all its diversity .
&quot; his command is to tear me away from the body as much as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he calls the loving &quot; rib@@ bon . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ iced in your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you can not measure you with him , and you cannot hold your terror . &quot;
my scre@@ ams did not fell enough to him why they ex@@ change@@ over the pipe by a cable .
&quot; during my first visit , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked as a gar@@ bage dump , or if that was included in the normal working environment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined , to present ourselves the one from their view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within one hour three of them turned out , while I was still in line . &quot;
&quot; I had lost all feeling in my body - and my voice , which is why I heard hear@@ ti@@ pped . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er spot@@ ted the cooling and did not found a favor , which is why he emerged as the next to an electric charge . &quot;
flow rate my entire body enough to store my whole quarter .
&quot; my semi @-@ bare body , the out@@ stretched on the ground was the perfect electricity leader . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
&quot; after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night . &quot;
it must have been so at midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed that I arrived as minutes .
then the call for dawn .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light opens the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I answered with the voice of a exhausted youths : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father has to worry fear@@ lessly . &quot;
&quot; be silent and be@@ amed you , you will be vict@@ orious . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Mexican Rap@@ by Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b re@@ bel over the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b spends the majority of his time inside , from time to his couch , to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
&quot; but what one can leave , is a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine be@@ f@@ ted lips . &quot;
&quot; he lives on the top of his family house , which had been hearing them since 1967 ; in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had forced themselves to escape from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( approximately : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for now six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and asks their old ideas about gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression by art and Rap@@ id@@ music . &quot;
&quot; with his music , who often deals with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian Arab world , but also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all of these issues do not only lie in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ ance but also in cities that are rich by Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as a person who in his mind is not restricted by borders , and he can feel loud upon his own statement with the people who suffer the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , the Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not reveal it openly , he put a special dis@@ incl@@ ination against the American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b looks at his art in his studio Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b doesn &apos;t believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones , anything that was born with his identity as &quot; Palestinian &quot; Palestinian &quot; of the second generation , &quot; even though he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I do not think of my own life circumstances , &quot; says H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , while he sh@@ ines into the waters of Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan , during that time it is provided for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ ical law also testi@@ fied that public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee is hot in a sen@@ ing hot jun@@ c@@ ag little with protest against Islam . &quot;
basically the cr@@ ut@@ ch of hot coffee and the sw@@ ades of the K@@ ent cigarette is in the nose first and foremost of freedom .
&quot; Jordan , like a prison in the open sky above all , when you take a look at the neighboring countries . &quot;
therefore it avo@@ ids easy to do basic things - how to drink water during Ram@@ adan water - to not land in prison .
&quot; recently , the Department of Jord@@ anian has announced a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
some parliament@@ arians who support the Islamic Action front - the Ottoman branch of the Muslim Br@@ otherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual Fron@@ tier was contradi@@ ct the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert &apos;s concert .
the MP and former spokes@@ person in the Islamic coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; had just been cancelled due to sexual orientation of the proposition .
&quot; many in addition , the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activ@@ ism that author@@ it@@ ate the well @-@ approved legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la portr@@ ayed as &quot; &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; &quot; which continue to work for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement may not simply be simply sil@@ ently Rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but in fact a more and more evident to reflect the cryst@@ all@@ ine reality in Jordan which appear in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs plant clearly . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional sex @-@ men turned to Lei@@ be , having formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pres@@ i@@ timate sex . &quot;
&quot; the image shows the skel@@ eton of a apparently burnt @-@ known woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red sea ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who were actually trust@@ worthy . &quot;
in Jordan the number of &apos; Hon@@ en@@ mor@@ de &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
&quot; human Rights Watch reached its peak in 2016 the number of hon@@ orary capacity in 2016 reached its peak . however , the Jordan is still missing to support Jordan , the victims of attempted murder and domestic violence to support an adequate manner . &quot;
&quot; according to a law of dis@@ ruption from the year 1954 , women cannot be exposed to in@@ tra @-@ family violence &quot; , &quot; and for their release is often a long @-@ term bureaucr@@ atic effort , as well as the guarantee of the family needed that the woman has nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs Music enjoys great popularity , and is well known not to shy away from themes in his country as t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is politically , but is fact that he is his music , the full explicit ass@@ ures of sexuality , freedom and expression , cannot be separated from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , Mann . &quot;
&quot; to me politics was artic@@ ulated , &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
&quot; in &quot; &quot; Lav@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of songs that are in the core of politics can be continued .
&quot; in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song with the title &quot; &quot; Sant@@ or@@ ano &quot; . &quot; &quot;
in this song a delay can be repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the song , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get in his words , &quot; what you want &quot; - whether it is faith or non @-@ faith , heter@@ ogen@@ o- or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he notices that there is hardly anyone in Jordan concerning the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still being c@@ ens@@ ored in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b introduced an interview for the popular Ju@@ jan &apos;s Onlin@@ e@@ Programme Ro@@ ya to see later that his comments were torn out of the context and c@@ eased his opinion c@@ ens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but it was only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has g@@ rie@@ ve H@@ d@@ ai@@ b open for the arab@@ ic LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als does not un@@ lock the Islam .
&quot; he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a Po@@ ets of the eighth century , which still has remained in memory thanks to its hom@@ o@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks herself : when Abu Nu@@ what was to work later on behalf of the cali@@ ph@@ ate , in the eighth century openly were to write homosexu@@ ality , why can Jordan not be ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic kingdom , it is nothing new , that the government has sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are going to be sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ anic mess@@ service held several former Govern@@ ments and members of the teacher association , with the reason , they would have expressed criticism in social media critical about the problems that were rooted in deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this is the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs , according to that , only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress has been a continual give and taking . Jordan has now re@@ vered for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - it is like H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , bed@@ ding and inner@@ most changes . it is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ ian society . &quot;
&quot; finally , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs also , of a Arab world without interventions abroad . &quot;
&quot; he doesn &apos;t just dreams of his work until Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them to experience it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is affected by music , art and literature of a true and fundamental openness - and not by bom@@ bs , quar@@ um@@ uni@@ tions and on artificial nature of the guided democr@@ acies . at least hop@@ pers . &quot;
&quot; until it is , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue , and thus res@@ ist resistance . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these great , ex@@ travag@@ ant warri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the fo@@ uta festival .
&quot; one thought that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ kus . another theory h@@ ates that the drums and dancing over more than a thousand years were passed , in the armies from Western Japan found the indigenous people of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to force in their kne@@ es . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to sn@@ ap some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
it can only be difficult to imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a joint project in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ yo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ac@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fair@@ ers are straight to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people , who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only True - and a breathtaking way of spending his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and I looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high celebration was amazing .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to getting more and more norm@@ alities into the experienced hands of hair@@ styles that can follow these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , even has an annual event inspired , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there , experts join each other to show who you can see the ec@@ cent@@ ri@@ sts L@@ ooks to see how to see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to immer@@ se young people to immer@@ se their arms against hair@@ dressing tools and get instead of bad advice to get education in hair@@ dressing tools that allow them to find work . &quot;
motivated by this activity and the potential opportunities have do@@ zens of young people seen that they can take a profession who is currently in fashion .
the school was presented in front of the school year prior to the launch of the school year and reported some of their achievements :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only professional school in the community and the district where we are very proud , because from love for the children we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : love @-@ rie@@ fe at Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ ler

&quot; the following article is the written version of the paper &quot; &quot; love message on Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ ler &quot; &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the report will be published here in a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love @-@ letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not much more important , people who make themselves feel engra@@ ved , affection ? &quot;
&quot; exactly this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activists from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ ci@@ li@@ ación ( letters for reconciliation ) , the young people do not endor@@ se guer@@ ri@@ lla &apos;s letters . &quot;
&quot; only recently the country was a place of a historical event , and they wanted to contribute to their part . after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces in Colombia ) , which forms the cl@@ ue of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , International was considered to be the under@@ signed of the peace contract as so important that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos was awarded for its services to the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; however , in front of the colum@@ bi@@ ans , there is a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ ri@@ lla warri@@ ors who lived for many years in illegal bearings , had been exposed to war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , and around the clock to rest their weapons in order to integrate themselves back into life as a civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , who had acc@@ ust@@ omed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hate to guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare , it must now take in her ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young colum@@ bi@@ ans would have to close together and help with the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now have thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla war in order to welcome them back in society .
&quot; the purpose of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla , which should be transferred personally . &quot;
the Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose over the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , who took place in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian the opportunity to speak to the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 , was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this stated that we &apos;d love the people we love , on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day of lovemaking , but those forget that they need much unnecessary . &quot;
&quot; he will plan , he again spoke to share his love with people this year , who needed the warm@@ est commitment . &quot;
&quot; in such a plan , the plan , letters full of hope and support for former fighters of F@@ ARC to write now their place in society and must establish a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters are prepared to say the Colom@@ bian society to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
so far as part of the campaign more than 2000 letters have been collected .
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa , and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
I have never thought that anyone would forgive &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on March 19th in one of the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
&quot; a group of 40 students of the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo of the Foundation of Bog@@ ot@@ Art traveled in the camp to personally transfer the letters . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC had done so much as they had done before in order to assume the prec@@ epts of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders but letters full of care of people from all over the country .
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between them , &quot; &quot; told the political science student , Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra , a staff of the Govern@@ ors in the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca descri@@ bing this unforgettable experience :
&quot; after we passed the letters , a former fighters carried out by the camp of the Gu@@ er@@ illa @-@ fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla war live ) , I saw a guer@@ illa , who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid of leaving , for beside him on the bed lay a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ ter , a deadly weapon in the thorn @-@ bra@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; I spoke to him anyway , and said , &quot; &quot; Hi , what are they doing exactly ? &quot; he answered , &quot; I answered a letter I wrote to me . &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never before in my life , someone has written something so nice , so I gave me suddenly the tears over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I im@@ pover@@ ished him completely and set me beside the pom@@ eg@@ ades .
&quot; maybe he was sorry to be the war , I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . joining the F@@ ARC , the only way to keep him and his six brothers from hunger p@@ d . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is a society there , who wa@@ its with open arms to us . &quot;
&quot; up to now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace prev@@ ails , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; at the pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion . &quot;
the students had grown up all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already worked in secret .
&quot; therefore the leaders of the F@@ ARC , the history of the organization , their ideals and gave an insight into their views about the peace process : for many years we have experienced the social injustice through the state into the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to contribute to a political party , we can contribute to creating society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this magnitude , it is worth to overcome all the obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; listening to these people who had never been hearing the hearing so far and no voting right , and to recognize that people whom I have often seen as monsters and even hate , even people with nice feelings of living and their environment were very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , does hurt me . &quot;
&quot; but it comfort@@ ed me that all men - including those who killed and so much damage , we can teach us a bit and give a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the com@@ mander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
&quot; the colum@@ bi@@ ans has been declared that after the draft peace , there would be peace . &quot;
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as it is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and job opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to access the weapons and to protest and to protest for their rights . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; for this reason we call all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of race , religion or ideology - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrific@@ es , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence , will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homosexu@@ als and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an region are exposed to a wide spectrum of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
with hor@@ rors we have experienced the reporting of the last months on the persecution of pregnant men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; however , the threat that depends on how a D@@ amo@@ is worth over the astr@@ ay LGB@@ T@@ Q municipality , is not until overnight . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us what happens in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legislation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered several months ago by the international head@@ lines , after reports were published , covering the cover , torture and killing que@@ er men in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ ni@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gaz@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the suspected que@@ er men and they in secret pr@@ isons in the gun . &quot;
&quot; you have brought a mon@@ ster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sabrina , a woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
since her childhood she felt that she was actually a woman .
&quot; when she was born , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
after a group of Ch@@ echn@@ ya learned from the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened to Sabrina . &quot;
&quot; because of fear about her life , she finally moved to the USA . &quot;
Sabrina : I was active as a volunteer assistant at a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ gres@@ sor , which arose in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; as I tried to help her , he made a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his tsch@@ et@@ ch@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya which can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the round of the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was doing it , a few shopping st@@ ems from the back seat of my car , I heard a male &apos;s voice to say : &quot; this is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned myself , I sen@@ sed something in my body , but I did not hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard another phrase , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long do you still want to honor the family , thou sc@@ and@@ fl@@ eck ? &quot;
I knew the person not .
&quot; I just know that there was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost the consciousness and aw@@ oke the last end in the hospital again .
apparently some women got everything to get and to cry out .
the man was fled .
the women had a sick .
in the hospital I learned that I had two key@@ points in my right lung .
OC Media : in what condition have you been placed - in the men or women of women ?
&quot; Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name in it ; but the doctor promised and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful to him for that .
&quot; when I was reading his name for the first time in his office , I got to do with the fear ; it was a Muslim name , a Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he has been respectful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got Dro@@ h@@ ungen .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - Related , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of an alpine space .
my family was visited by neighbours and several distant relatives .
&quot; the required , to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie . &quot;
&quot; they invited himself : some told me , I want to prove it by the streets of the street ; others wanted that I had not changed my sex in Gros@@ ny , and say that I had not changed my sex , that all was just mud , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have set @-@ size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how has your family tried to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some older people already spoke my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; You have brought a mon@@ ster to the world that has not only your family but the whole of the Republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay down a strike around the neck .
luckily the neighbors and rescue them were .
I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later in the window he stood a car with th@@ read@@ ed window disc@@ s and a number plate with a number of 95 .
&quot; after the third time happened , I realized that something was lazy . &quot;
my husband &apos;s friends over@@ beat the number@@ ing signs - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how have you been flying ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I will not want to reveal their names but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help , I left the country , but then a little dis@@ belief . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SI@@ M card to call my mom when I arrived .
&quot; I bought her , without register without permission , without all . &quot;
&quot; I broke my old SI@@ M card , and cast them into the tr@@ ash . &quot;
arrived and chec@@ s into the hotel .
the number was listed on a stran@@ ger .
I tasted the SI@@ M card into my mobile phone .
&quot; in the moment I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think about , you are sure , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you do . you even know your room number .
just to prove it : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine this ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still stand in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about the gender equality yet , this is a tabby topic . &quot;
some traditional Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an elements I still wear in myself .
&quot; as much as I wish , this se@@ el@@ ic barrier can not be overcome . &quot;
&quot; I say , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with a camera , I actually give myself trouble how the person looks out of her past - so remember my male . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sabrina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the needed I needed current information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; I spoke with someone , the one and a half months in the gun . &quot;
&quot; he told that during the Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not end a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; for that I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are also being listed even pregnant men in these secret services ?
Sabrina : a friend of me says it wasn &apos;t so many .
&quot; if , then above all those who have no rich relatives , or who were dropped from their relatives in order to face Cad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be held there , so that they can present them later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim , they would have attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply missing but deliberately suppres@@ sed to radi@@ ate themselves .
OC Media : is this now just a mut@@ ation or do you have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just thre@@ w someone who was imprison@@ ed in Ar@@ gun at a half months .
he says that many people in this prison were van@@ ished after their beard .
there was no news of them since .
they have just taken them away .
&quot; so called Lord , that person was even involved when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now they were not presented as band@@ its , but there were no reports until now . we assume that such actions are at all possible . &quot;
why would you have not allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so called &quot; &quot; traditional &quot; &quot; orientation , already in the past ? &quot;
Sabrina : I always carried my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think I was already known before 2003 , when I was still living there - and I never had problems . &quot;
in the case of Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia was forced to lead us to the &quot; &quot; civilian par@@ ation &quot; , &quot; but finally he finally cast us into the st@@ one@@ age . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were exhausted ; I had colored eyelashes , wor@@ so@@ je@@ ans and a short set . &quot;
the safety of the sh@@ aria has never bent me only a hair .
&quot; before Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several ben@@ ches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we were never sinn@@ ed .
in the Ch@@ echn@@ yan language there is a speech : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that is said : &quot; Sp@@ el@@ otte not over the un@@ happiness of another .
you often say it to children if it &apos;s about cranes funny .
&quot; OC Media : so just have her eyes closed before you , because they believed , you are sick ? &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
they have never sinn@@ ed me , never h@@ unted and never be@@ aten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this treasure time stopped ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row stood on the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister 2005 , he began to speak on the mor@@ als on television . &quot;
&quot; he did not say about us , but focuses on the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel like the people in the city began to change . &quot;
those who had formerly pun@@ ched and pun@@ ished at once with suspic@@ ion .
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; every time I got back home , I could feel like the situation in the Republic has been spar@@ ed steadily . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sabrina : I work as wa@@ it@@ ress .
I won &apos;t have much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
otherwise I still work as a activ@@ ist .
&quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize teac@@ ups , together , I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get foo@@ dies . &quot;
I do not waste a pen@@ ny for this .
I discovered these people myself when I stum@@ bled away .
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : this is al@@ bern .
&quot; so is nature , it certainly has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; that is exactly the same thing as Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who want to make you clear with ham in front of the mouth , that there is no co@@ ils in them . &quot;
&quot; the Dag@@ est@@ ans have created the cab@@ aret which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet there are they - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear . &quot;
I come here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
&quot; many of them - practicing Muslims , who go into the mosque and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live together with males . &quot;
&quot; you know , many think of transi@@ denti@@ ty to men who love men and they believe that you altern@@ ate his sex to make more intimate experience . but that is a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation , to be precise , different settings . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ash@@ amed me for my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry that I will be here so personal , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am now I myself .
local groups warn of an increase of self @-@ murder within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab ancestors @-@ community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an unusual high unemployment and poverty rate among the native Arab population .
&quot; since the past few months , there has been a sharp rise in self @-@ murder . &quot;
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on the 27th of August the dist@@ res@@ sing situation of the Arab @-@ Nazi community in Iran , which is characterised by poverty and unemployment , into the li@@ mel@@ ight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he sh@@ ame@@ works for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness that can pay off the in@@ capacity for his family , so Ah@@ as@@ azi human rights groups that are working in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; one at the YouTube divided video held the moments , after being fired up to himself . &quot;
&quot; some people managed to delete the fl@@ ames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything more . &quot;
he died short time later .
&quot; it was not the only su@@ ic@@ ide that lasted in August within the Arab @-@ Nazi minority , and activists from spot to warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ th@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announces that for this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab B@@ ani Tam@@ im - burned . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : it was all family members , who felt thanks to the persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and felt , to feed their families and to im@@ part in a safe work . &quot;
Arab A@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
&quot; the region in which a large part of the Arab A@@ w@@ azi community located in Iran was sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult to indu@@ ce the native Arab population to cur@@ se its livel@@ i@@ hoods . &quot;
&quot; in a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was an predominantly aut@@ on@@ ome region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ monarchy took over power and took over 1925 major efforts to stop ethnic autonomy in all Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran past oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most enlight@@ ening and most valuable commercial space for the Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy will continue to grow slowly , and the local population only gets little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime is denied the Ah@@ w@@ azi Arabs systematically work in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a large number of roofs , the water from the Arab areas into the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are located . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have led only to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation in the region through dro@@ ught , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palms industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi youth is now up to 81 % .
&quot; Moh@@ ammed Moh@@ ammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Consul@@ ate director for co @-@ operative , work and social welfare , announces that 5 % of the A@@ w@@ az@@ is who finished a work , finished elementary school , 55 % a further school finished and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance .
&quot; Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian rep@@ lica @-@ human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that leads the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of self @-@ murder among the young ancestors @-@ Nazi men . &quot;
&quot; Doh@@ im@@ i said that especially unemployment has become worse , the reason for this is a combination of a high number of in ancestors @-@ emerging ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process : &quot;
&quot; as officials and institutions do not prefer to set the Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ th@@ azi will des@@ erted access to work possibilities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs , and forcing them to earn their livel@@ i@@ hoods outside their home of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their suburbs and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ we@@ azi and so be questioned because even Arab names in the workplace will not be toler@@ ated , because even the speech of the Arabic language or the sad@@ ness of Arabic clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances , which must end@@ ure the Arab ancestors , strike human rights activ@@ ist alarm , before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world becomes costly and aware of it .
the main reason for su@@ ic@@ ide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ ic@@ ide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

&quot; the following article is a revised version of opinion , written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ ich@@ i and originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions were expressed . &quot;
you can read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; when I say I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put together well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we need to be all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , that women nowadays still earn less money in spite of the same formation as men . &quot;
&quot; that women are still under tight observation , when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body . &quot;
that violence against women is an epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women have come into a gl@@ aci@@ ously rock in the sooner or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on sex is still across the many different countries and fai@@ ths . &quot;
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced that I am twice and three .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , when I come to speak on skin colour , on racism , on black female @-@ women , on black women in the LGB@@ T community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a , when I warn of what kind we have been physically , se@@ el@@ ian and verbal abuse , a lot of white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists had to be silent . &quot;
but anyway they all agree that women - all women should come together to take their voices and to sing &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya &apos; to sing my Lord &apos; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about it that there is in addition to sexu@@ alised violence an institution@@ alized form racial or rac@@ ist violence that we are exposed to black women in two times .
&quot; or in fact , black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and country of origin earn less than white men and women . &quot;
&quot; the fact that black girls and girls are referred to as a white girl with an immig@@ rant background , due to more obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women are exposed to a higher risk of women in black spheres , domestic violence and violence in black spheres , domestic violence and violence in the partnership , than white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand I want all women , all men and all men are tied to equal rights ; on the other hand , I can not join in motion as a black woman , in whose centre the white woman is , who refuse to take into account both the gender and the skin color of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted and will no longer fight my membership in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere , which has always rejected me and many other black women . &quot;
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner said 18@@ 51 in their speech : &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and also I refuse to maintain an ideology , in which the black woman is in historical respect a human and margin@@ alized essence . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join me groups , which are also absor@@ bing through cultural ex@@ propri@@ ation , our customs , and customs , in order to advance their eg@@ oc@@ ent@@ ric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer seek to paraly@@ ze white women the importance of over@@ cutting of skin colour and gender , as some of them will continue to hide the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to honor them for the better . &quot;
&quot; although the intercultural femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different residen@@ ces a home and get off from the white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name . &quot;
&quot; I refer to it , fully and entirely from femin@@ ism and ex@@ clude me to the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which is known for my dark skin and my status as wife &apos;s paradi@@ gm , which is so in@@ sist@@ ent , that Inter@@ se@@ k@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever that we define black women based on our own ideas and let us move into the spheres , which will be created for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson Valley , the author of Africa &apos;s W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing herself ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered that make the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and interactive femin@@ ists are immediately calling separ@@ atism and exclusion , after having read these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement from which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a bl@@ ur@@ istic environment , I can up@@ lift black women and women from other cultures , because in this paradi@@ gm I existed . &quot;
I will be recognized as a woman as part of this paradi@@ gm due to my dark skin and due to my being .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life has neither passed over , nor ignored . &quot;
highlight against the pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this entry by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in@@ particular about international efforts to solve environmental issues . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be released here again . &quot;
&quot; over the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or Can@@ oe - with a particular concern due to the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aimed to consciously make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a who explains us his relationship with the rivers and the impact of pollution at his church . &quot;
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was yet a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country are concerned that the decades of war , construction of storage , pollution and the un@@ controll@@ able development , lead to a immediate water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO Water@@ ke@@ epers Foundation - a subsidiary of Water@@ ke@@ eper Alliance - which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq and to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a takes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we have no water any more , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , produced in Iraq , in Iraq and multi@@ medi@@ al journalist , filmed and published . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work lies on persec@@ uted , little nation@@ alized sub@@ cultures and is distinguished by using co@@ oper@@ ative vide@@ ography and new multi@@ medi@@ al techniques with their help of suppres@@ sed communities who can tell their stories in their way . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the shorten@@ ed and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ dist@@ an . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # devi@@ ates mis@@ og@@ bin ) , who reported about the violence of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
most names have been changed to protect the persons affected .
&quot; An@@ da B@@ á@@ ez said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had become violent against violence . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship had passed some time and the police said , their statement would be placed among the acts , but more could not do . &quot;
&quot; as another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed for abuse , also the ac@@ ten@@ ant display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez nothing . &quot;
a few days later the second woman moved their ad .
breaking the devil @-@ circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; once women are paid at all , they do not generally receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases women also depend on the men , dependent on them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence , at all in law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; content 1 duc@@ tions and Statisti@@ cs 2 Inv@@ isible ab@@ uses and a judicial system , which is nothing suppres@@ sed @-@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of conversion and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to determine how many women are really mis@@ used , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , a social @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various data and reports , which however does not even trace the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
but the numbers available are also alar@@ ming .
&quot; in 2015 , the district court pro@@ secution went to 9@@ 600 ads because of domestic violence . at 70 % of this , it went on violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the indicators in police have arrived by women .
&quot; there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence among the peace of peace . here , 86 % of women were assigned to women . &quot;
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were mis@@ used physically , 55 % of women said by psych@@ ic abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics reveal not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the M@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister , Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; &quot; to any woman who are re@@ imb@@ urs@@ ed to Paraguay for psych@@ ic abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; every woman who re@@ igned because of physical failure , two women who do not do this , &quot; explained it at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; as women &apos;s ide in Paraguay have no own crimes , the criminal enforcement agencies may not be adequately documented how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners . &quot;
alone until August 2016 journalists described at least 12 cases of su@@ ic@@ ide in the country .
the coordin@@ ator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women have been mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
&quot; after its estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies on account of violence by men . &quot;

invisible missions and a judicial system that takes nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called his name for him all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning they didn &apos;t want it , but then gave it to them . this should be for ever @-@ rep@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer coinci@@ de with Carlos together . but two years she carried the mental violence in turn - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe forms of violence . &quot;
I have never thought that I would get victims of abuse .
&quot; if I read about it earlier , I always thought that the only women are happening , because they are dec@@ eived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana useless social media to report about the ab@@ sent@@ encing by Carlos Vera .
&quot; to name without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook where they described his insul@@ ts and different attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had ins@@ ulated them . &quot;
&quot; many people answered their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why she had dropped off for so long by Carlos and did not leave it earlier . &quot;
&quot; it seemed almost like that , when they wanted to say that the victims of abuse would have at least a certain inno@@ c@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , which does not origin@@ ate from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that its former partner has been adul@@ ter@@ ated . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &apos; I believe you &apos; ) that consists of women all in any way victims of mis@@ ab@@ uses .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listening to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything began with psych@@ ic abuse .
&quot; their wealthy partners made it even to convince them that they were worth@@ less . &quot;
then he started to beat her .
&quot; Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as adver@@ ts with the authorities remained without a result and also of their relatives , they did not receive support . &quot;
&quot; it led a process against its former partner who developed into a und@@ ur@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of their former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws which are very good but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the ad of abuse is a way full of resist@@ ors , and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees big problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill introduced in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ian parliament which was known under the has@@ ht@@ ag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # Für@@ s ) . &quot;
this Has@@ ht@@ ag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ Only ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International .
&quot; the original design of the law seems to explain and be harder to explain to a peculi@@ ar crime , and to pun@@ ish and pun@@ ish it in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; if the Code was modified in some points to also win the Members of the Law , which also feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions are not allowed to be pun@@ ished in Paraguay , and with up to five years in prison . &quot;
&quot; the original rule was intended to carry the majority of ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) procedures that must bear the victims of violence currently even if they just re@@ funding and maintain a safe accommodation , the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ator does not provide sufficient financial resources to make it available :
in Paraguay is not seen as a part of human relationships .
&quot; here , a re@@ think has to take place so that violence is no longer considered as anything normal . &quot;
&quot; those who are speaking of this facts is guilty , and contributes to the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators brought away . &quot;
we need to report so long to ab@@ ide by no more than normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Sen@@ ate . previously , parts of the law have been changed . however , there was a passage of passage in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation . &quot;
the views on the changes go apart .
&quot; the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the ag@@ gres@@ sor , to re@@ attack his sacrifice . &quot;
&quot; the use of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; in parts of the law shall however be considered a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in O@@ man continues to be suspended once a year on the pro@@ hibition of a newspaper
&quot; this website has been blocked because of a decision of the information officer , is read on the home page of the b@@ issued newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than one year ago , the Ottoman authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the Sultan . &quot;
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he viol@@ ates a year prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and brought to judgment , but came again later . &quot;
&quot; O@@ man has been governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power after he had set his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , by a state of state . &quot;
&quot; since then he died , next to his role as the only Sultan , the most important ether in the country : prime minister , Minister of Defence , Minister of Defence , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Minister of Ministers , Chairman of the Supreme Council for the planning and president of the central bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of the sult@@ an is marked by the per@@ sever@@ ing efforts of security forces , in particular of the domestic secrets , public freedom , including press freedom , including freedom of press , and more activists , blog@@ gers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and prevent citizens , also activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in public authorities and institutions , as well as offline . &quot;
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n was closing the closing of three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its inc@@ eption in 2007 was reported on corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , had appeared in a article entitled &quot; high @-@ level parties committed to justice . &quot; in this it was about corruption in the judiciary and the presence of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government ministers were accused , judge of the Supreme Court in O@@ man under pressure to raise a judgment in a inheritance . &quot;
&quot; the paper of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 , with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; high @-@ level parties bind hands on the judiciary . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was arrested , member of the Board of editors , from the ISS the Special Department and captured upon his arrival by the security guards . &quot;
on 9 August 2016 the ISS awarded the dep@@ uty @-@ chief editor of You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j who had been acting as a chief editor .
&quot; the paper was closed at an unlimited period after the information was given the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , starting from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , before the court in Mas@@ kat took place the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i . &quot;
the court condemned the three journalists on pr@@ isons and followed the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned among others because of dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; under@@ mining the state of the State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of an audience &apos;s har@@ b@@ inger and the exp@@ ul@@ sion of guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and money pen@@ alties in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . it also has a one @-@ year professional ban against the two journalists .
&quot; al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a penalty in the amount of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 USD ) , after the use of a information network for the distribution of material , which could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a deposit was set up in the amount of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released before the judgment of judgment on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the appeal of Ap@@ pe@@ al said al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , however , distributed Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ ma@@ amar@@ i to six months of prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i was released on 10 April 2017 for the h@@ ay of his six@@ teenth prison sentence in Mas@@ kat died . al @-@ Ha@@ j continued to prison in prison where he con@@ du@@ ck his years of prison .
the Ap@@ pe@@ als also highlighted the decision of the Information Ministry to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision taken by the court , Az@@ am@@ n , the paper continues to be exposed to attacks by the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; on January 8 , the Information sm@@ in@@ ers had an assignment with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on May 8 , 2017 the information Minister has personally signed a further directive in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; had been extended by three additional months and thus bringing the Minister another time to the decision of the appeal , the publication of the newspaper again . &quot;
&quot; the en@@ closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in O@@ man , the press freedom has recently been in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
&quot; for example , inter alia , the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country , set their operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the det@@ ention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the idea that the om@@ an@@ ical authorities are still not ready to get an end to the comprehensive violation of freedom of the press . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the European authorities on : &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and unconditional release ;
&quot; 2 . a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n to create , so that their journalists can lead to their work ; &quot;
3 . to protect the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances , to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in O@@ man can di@@ ct their right@@ ful human rights and without fear of repr@@ is@@ ations , including judicial remedy . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ er 2016 in Zambia , representation is done with its consent &quot;
&quot; medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media , or even at all . it is a growing area , addressed one of the most urgent needs of the continent . &quot;
&quot; for the need at local medical research there are two reasons : for a lack of global health system , there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria in the poorest countries of Africa have severe effects than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem . &quot;
&quot; second , research , which is conducted by African scientists themselves , in building up own research capacity in Africa . a larger role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or is Director of the Center for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , precisely when the AIDS epide@@ mic had seen the first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself decided on HIV virus , before going back home to support the sam@@ b@@ ish health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ er discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ conc@@ eptions of the media through this research . &quot;
( disclaimer : Dr. Warri@@ er speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or R@@ W : at the moment is the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with lab tests .
&quot; I just got a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogen@@ s . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ A : what are your opinion on the important current knowledge themes in your country , and in general in Africa ? &quot;
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
R@@ W : there is no basic research here . we only set out solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always be recip@@ ients to be by yourself . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is they sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for your projects ?
R@@ W : from the United States and Europe .
the projects are very well supported .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or come here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
R@@ W : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; lab material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public opinion of science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; R@@ W : there are interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods are taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; G@@ V : how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they concentrate and how can we support development ? &quot;
R@@ W : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , Big Data , research on the space environment , the health care system ( not transfer@@ able and cont@@ agi@@ ous diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ V : can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; R@@ W : often , it is the limited speed , things to do , and the start@@ up access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that periodic@@ als make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , but also limited the quantity of availability of information and the speed of research . &quot;
&quot; from the USA to India , such as &quot; Open Source &quot; seed , global food production &quot;
&quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that covers solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has been bred in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 sorts , such as Out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA @-@ A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in the space @-@ area and consumed . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mor@@ tons &apos;s work was confined working only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many sal@@ ine varieties can get limits . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noted that more and more sal@@ ads were patented , and that he could not continue to use them for breeding . &quot;
&quot; patents tend not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special rotor or green , or curved sheets . &quot;
&quot; over the last few years , more and more of such patents have been log@@ ged on more and more plants such as grain or map @-@ sites . due to these trends , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists are concerned about the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as an im@@ passion@@ ed representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of tradition , Mor@@ ton is still a salad , but it takes a lot longer because his work is getting more and more and more complicated . &quot;
it &apos;s like would lying in a river a rock where I have to kill .
&quot; so we have to make that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go to sal@@ ads . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed any more of a new sal@@ ads , because all the features are patented , so he is trying to recover those features that he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and makes every effort to use material which is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he is also connected with a movement that is ever greater in the USA and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ breeding ) .

&quot; it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area , and not from the field of plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ right@@ ed software . &quot;
&quot; it was launched into the life to ensure that some plant species and gene are not protected as intellectual property , and are permanently usable for plant bree@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of the initiative , in short Os@@ si , US @-@ bre@@ eder can commit to that others were able to use them seeds freely . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that with their seeds , do not continue to do business and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bree@@ ders only allow others to breed their seeds , to breed for so own varieties , and it is not immediately utter@@ ed - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ente . &quot;
do@@ zens of bre@@ eder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy views
&quot; for the em@@ ented professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and Os@@ si @-@ Vor@@ spann@@ ing Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food safety and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try to use the latter or not only little by maxim@@ ise seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open source &quot; movement is not busy with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , corn , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; &quot; who is offered to our goal of ecological sustainability , &quot; &quot; who is offered good , local and sustain@@ ably more frequent si@@ zing foods in August and September 2016 , should also know that the way is bred as the vegetables , such as this vegetables is bred . &quot;
&quot; di@@ spar@@ ity without seeds , is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative will also commit themselves to further their seeds at their disposal . thus , you can also be patented in contrast , seeds and plant @-@ features . &quot;

&quot; Os@@ si Sup@@ er argue that the future of food supplies is je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy , since the available genetic pool due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights based on plant material , which is thus becoming more restric@@ tive , un@@ change@@ able . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of the Os@@ si , has engaged in her PhD @-@ work with genetic variation with car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . she found that about a third of all cart@@ els @-@ characteristics is protected as real estate , thus making it available for plant bree@@ ders either at all or not only . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there are such estimates not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass@@ acres are patented in even larger style as sal@@ ads or car@@ r@@ ots . &quot;
a question of point of view
&quot; plants are so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from such , through which their taste or colour increases up to such a result , due to which they prosp@@ er in certain environments , and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
opponents by pat@@ enting on the plant characteristics suggest that the available plant material for bre@@ eder by becoming more and more patents . genetic variety is now but necessary than ever since changed conditions by climate change are much worse than ever before .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ aker Car@@ ly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to , that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos &apos;s activities . with a total of four co @-@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is preparing for the conservation of the genetic variety . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradi@@ cts that the intellectual property of other bree@@ ders bo@@ ots , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ ances are promoting innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is essentially taken a plan that everyone can follow , as soon as the patent is ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to reach the same result with another method .
&quot; such protection does not im@@ pe@@ de innovation , but encourages it to be provided by the public to provide more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton sees the other way : 20 years to wait until a patent p@@ umping , is certainly not innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you have so long waiting for waiting , to grow in plants that have been adapted to changing environmental conditions , you could have lost the battle already . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is however that genetic resources must always have been a common good and continue to stay : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ ary incentives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what motiv@@ ates us , and it will make us impossible if we do not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mor@@ ton does not distur@@ b themselves to the concept of pat@@ tern@@ ed plant @-@ mal : &quot; we do not create the features themselves . &quot;
the plants are themselves formed by themselves and as bree@@ ders we ultimately have no idea how the plants do it .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant bre@@ eder in the U.S. state Oregon and Os@@ si pre@@ amplifier , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who is an Sor@@ te , bred also its own values into it . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large cour@@ ty@@ ards and mon@@ oc@@ ultur@@ ists , who needs to be necessary for their cultivation of her@@ bic@@ ide , in its varieties of this concept of farming . &quot;
my concept is as accurate . &quot;
&quot; while some medium sized companies ( such that have to move on international markets , but smaller than for example Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents create , it will manage the most smaller plant breeding companies , even without patents , either reject them or keep it expensive and therefore not rewar@@ ding or both . &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ ders Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for in his breeding @-@ garden Sal@@ ads .

&quot; Mor@@ ton is also the view that bre@@ eder by the prevention of plant pat@@ rons of innovative would : &quot; it looks like me with my efforts to produce news , stronger than the company , the pat@@ rons . &quot;
&quot; I need a constantly new material for my catalogue , since I know that my ri@@ vals are selling my varieties in a couple of years ago , &quot; says it . &quot; with a patent is 20 years ahead of competition , which makes it very pretty easy to do . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in fact , the US appear to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; in breeding , but the concept spreads rapidly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture , &quot; which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , an open source plant breeding program works together with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties , fulfilling specific requirements . &quot;
&quot; it also supports them to get open &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; seed and sell their own . &quot;
&quot; the German organisation Agre@@ col works on an &quot; Open @-@ source &quot; license , which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si @-@ obligation for bree@@ ders in the European Union . &quot;
( regulations for breeding ground differ from country to country where the Os@@ si &apos;s obligation cannot be easily one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 the executive powers of the European Union , the European Commission declares that conventional plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , this speaks to itself against the current practice of the European patent Union , patents on conventional plants . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is still not a law ; it is now on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization hi@@ v@@ os organised a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operator of seeds , NGOs and seed companies from all over Eastern Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend toward pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seed systems , that the organisation is currently a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seed systems building , for the planned next year of the official start @-@ ups . &quot;
&quot; a federation consisting of environmental protection and development groups ( including hi@@ v@@ os , the international Non@@ profit @-@ development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish a seed map , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report that farmers have the opportunity to work on seeds , to exchange and improve seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured . &quot;
&quot; in the report also stresses the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable industrial equipment systems - a connection to which Lu@@ by from Os@@ si hopes that soon more people will be recognized soon . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has just taken care of where and how something grown , and seed systems have barely played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to cl@@ ing the people there even more behind their foods . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest objectives of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities content on the internet .
this time the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
&quot; on the weekend around the end of August the Egyptian government has raised the Egyptian Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents violations of human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; August , the network published an opinion on Facebook in which it criti@@ ci@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp@@ ly and promised , to continue working and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information sustained In spite of this attack and the constitution by the authorities , who seek to un@@ cover the law in this part of the world , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I also confirmed that all technical possibilities were exhausted to overcome the block@@ age and not to im@@ itate . we insist on it to fulfill our task further . &quot;
&quot; HR@@ I is considered the first c@@ ens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities concerned over two months ago , such as the independent post @-@ hand MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , arab@@ o @-@ language issue of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , and that from Qatar from Al J@@ aze@@ era , because of &quot; &quot; support of terrorism &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I &apos;s blog , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada did not have access to Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada took his blog for the distribution of colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles , which he writes in Egypt with accessible websites and media . &quot;
&quot; now the blog which he set up , in order to deal with the Z@@ ens@@ ur@@ apparatus of the Egyptian government , itself the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blog@@ ger , which is located in the name of Zi@@ ada blog , on the other hand , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity , after being arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian security guards , while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video how the police exercise physical violence against two students . &quot;
his article is about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada of the block@@ age vo@@ iced by the government and reflect what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the local blogs are very old , however , has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi . and even if the block@@ age of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is however still for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has succeeded to convey to me the feeling of a si@@ ege ; a det@@ ention , a attempted murder , pre@@ ach with the national Security Council , the lock blogs as well as any other website , for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I did not change anything else . in other words , my words have influence when even on a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to the post of articles in order to handle the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; however , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mu@@ tigen is the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ee and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) sper@@ r@@ ting Egyptian authorities from May 24 to June 06 , 133 websites . this erg@@ ing technical testing in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , e.g. Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
AF@@ TE documented the blocking of vendors who was possible through re@@ use of intern@@ s and private surfing possible so @-@ called virtual private networks ( VP@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in its research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the block@@ age of websites , the VP@@ N@@ s have started . &quot;
such practice indicates the intention of the government to block the content and to filter on which Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; in addition , the situation is additionally wast@@ ed that the c@@ ens@@ ory decisions could be taken behind closed doors and thereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which they can lead to justice against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants dispute .

&quot; day after day newspapers report newspapers in Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous post@@ cards . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school were killed , &quot; &quot; Every@@ one second day will mur@@ dered a police officers in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe smo@@ ker Ph@@ armacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers from the army , Marine and Lu@@ k@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the wave of violence achieved in Rio in the highest status for 10 years . &quot;
&quot; the Brazilian government organisation Global Justice called for the United Nations to interv@@ ene , even . &quot;
reports like this have become daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; as published for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; on 16 August , &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; in which it announced a new section called &quot; &quot; war in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the paper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ bery , sex , etc . , what happens from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio , will call in the column &quot; &quot; war in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call , this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists not ex@@ clude our eyes in front of the cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of the newspaper that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
&quot; extra is probably the only paper around the world with a war bri@@ g@@ ish in a country , which does not recognise war at all . &quot;
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that it is subject to information about the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 territories that are controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
in the Editorial article the newspaper continues :
&quot; we are aware that a war course , if it is distor@@ ted , also can be used , cru@@ el@@ ations of the police , who sho@@ ots up and then ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based upon information and the fight against corruption in police , whose objective is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the m@@ af@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
is the term &quot; war &quot; more than it is useful ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , was argu@@ ed to call the violence as a &quot; war &quot; . this would be their opinion a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy by the media and could make it ag@@ grav@@ ate responsibilities in the police to account . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - like extra in the analysis of military deploy@@ ments in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education , and a historical and self @-@ counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing of public service . &quot;
to memory : the federal state Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

&quot; Rio de Janeiro , regarded as &quot; the most violent country in Brazil , &quot; is according to Cec@@ í@@ lia false : &quot; 22 of the 30 violent @-@ day cities in Brazil lie according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date data . &quot;
none of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .

&quot; extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , which is empha@@ sized at Cec@@ í@@ lia , which has repeatedly repe@@ ats the Security Policy of the State . &quot;
&quot; on these safety principles , the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) was established by the police unit in 2003 by employ@@ ing a massive police activity to conquer an unity permanently . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , this was actually leading to a decrease of violent criminal deaths . for several years , the U@@ PP was leading to several reports on chic@@ ks and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor communities who should actually protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux made out of his article from the year 2010 , in which it explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the Geneva Convention - the criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also has serious consequences for people . &quot;
&quot; for this is demanding the state to use means and paths that are typical of a war . this is the penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the countryside and becomes the object for &quot; coll@@ ater@@ als . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war round or her , fact is that the inhabitants of Fav@@ elas have to suffer in Rio . &quot;
&quot; one week now , it is now that the police with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ van@@ ho er@@ kl@@ om@@ m in order to strike the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the P@@ ax and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and outskirts , H@@ oms , D@@ ei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently about one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; especially strongly affected is the region East Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 took the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume that the UN regime has exercis@@ ed the mass@@ acre of Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebels have been controlled un@@ controlled territories outside of Damascus under si@@ ege , which led to reli@@ ve local residents on local or through tunn@@ els and check@@ points . &quot;
&quot; through many years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ scale , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics , the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ ent@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms don &apos;t belong to conventional , in Syria , and are only extremely rare part of Syrian cuisine . however , their nutritional value makes it an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the bel@@ ated East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the direc@@ tor@@ ate of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate mushrooms from fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fought for for three years , and expressed his relief from it , that it gains more and more . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ mei@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge about the plant@@ ation of fung@@ i , so Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of its expected target of approximately 12.@@ 700 € , but will collect contributions to Can@@ do . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is dependent on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity in 80 % . &quot;
&quot; because of the fuel tank , locally produced fuel are used from plastic , to feed the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with the &quot; production from the world @-@ derived fungus , &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , they planted a small mush@@ room in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
&quot; now they have designed an &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after a further 3 months , they have spread mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the fung@@ al breeding for several reasons &quot; : break of the si@@ ege . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; distribution of a culture of self @-@ suff@@ iciency ( such as paper , tea , coffee ) , cardboard , etc ) are used for extraction of new foods . &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the Br@@ ings of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on the 21st of October in many districts of Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires that occurred during the week before the north of Portugal .
&quot; forty @-@ two people died , and about 70 have been in@@ ju@@ red by the forest fires on 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government was called out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days . &quot;
fires were also registered in the region of Gali@@ zi@@ en in Spain where there were 4 dead .
it appreci@@ ates that there were more than 500 fire@@ breaks that spread out in the northern and central regions of the country and around 250 million acres of forest and numerous villages .
&quot; in June , in Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande is a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest @-@ areas by satellite recordings , in 2017 , in Portugal about 500,000 acres of forest burned - an area of the size of the district Lisbon . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the Ernst of the situation : there is only in 4 districts .

numerous videos spread in the net and show pictures that allow better insights into the events :
the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protests of the Saturday was the call for better rewards and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked why the civil protection was not able to include the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
João So@@ ver@@ al by the Bund der Landwirte of Portugal stated the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; according to Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were ev@@ apor@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
this Sunday they did not nowhere : there are frag@@ ments of open streets enclosed by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen as in June as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , construction @-@ permit in eco @-@ locations will be raised with a high risk of fire risk . &quot;
&quot; far @-@ reaching proposal for the Wal@@ dre@@ ad , which had launched the government after grave fires in 2003 and 2005 , was raised by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a de@@ generation of the law by the case that the applicant had provided an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; leads João Sor@@ val in the same article by the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Quer@@ cus pointed out that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees made of slightly inflamm@@ able wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this species continues to spread . &quot;
&quot; on these issues , the website of the Civil Protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as resident searched or squee@@ zed , depen@@ dents to contact , offline . &quot;
&quot; it was a private initiative , which cat@@ ered the population with information : you used your own civilian data using the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt , informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires . &quot;
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer of João P@@ ina to simplify the work of fire bri@@ g@@ ade , and this fat@@ eful weekend in October was giving decisive that the servers of the 400,000 users were persec@@ uted , not with@@ held : they counted the website more than half a million access . &quot;

the way from the refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepreneurs

&quot; in one night in autumn 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years before , was a terrible civil war between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings that had defeated the short@@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan had become a land of terror and desp@@ air . &quot;
&quot; at this time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati was a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central America , for the last time with his family during dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother said it at that time , she didn &apos;t know that she would no longer see her son for a long time - maybe even more . &quot;
in the morning the boy should break up .
his un@@ cle would pick him down and bring him to the lo@@ ops .

CC @-@ 2.0
Abdu@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara @-@ e @-@ governor had just been mur@@ dered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly appeared immediately . &quot;
the Taliban had ever closer to their hat@@ red on the ha@@ ara @-@ known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his flight was As@@ shar@@ ks found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coher@@ ent . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left by his small salary , and went over to Iran . once again he found himself in a strange country together with other refugees and to@@ wing s@@ acks with mort@@ ar that were he@@ avier than he himself , in order to earn their living . &quot;
&quot; back then , as today , life of refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; remembered as A@@ shar@@ k in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an abandoned building on site , where we also worked . &quot;
&quot; there was no services and no heating . we suspended n@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we do not spare at night . &quot;
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ ks left his life without papers in Iran and made them ready for travel to Europe . &quot;
&quot; with the dangerous down@@ turn on the sea , he suffered the ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ and@@ ed on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities had rejected its asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ shar@@ af ob@@ at@@ los , running alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice the day eating in the most depri@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy due to relatively high Be@@ arbitr@@ ary quot@@ as is a kind of second chance for ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers . it is true , however , that the conditions , the asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
&quot; the human rights organisation of Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers under a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special record centres . &quot; &quot; this is impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be agreed when they have officially provided an application for asylum - which can lead to asylum after the registration of the asylum seeker . &quot;
to there are people who have no money for an accommodation either to rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his inno@@ cent livel@@ iness helped A@@ shar@@ k to rid himself out of these conditions soon .
&quot; after spending several years of working in the building work , Sy@@ shar@@ ks made its complete savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this ran so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snor@@ er .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the topic of &quot; &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; behind Venetian ) of the director A@@ min W@@ ah@@ id@@ i . &quot;
&quot; in 2017 , the film won the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to the official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
for many of them the country is a transi@@ tional solution on the road to other European countries .
&quot; in recent years some of Afghanistan &apos;s company , including in@@ ths , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ ans were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , in which the wa@@ iters and the kitchens are largely made from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant was told by the various af@@ gh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts , the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
&quot; the Afgh@@ ans entrepreneurs Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua , the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome also stands the Afgh@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s targets are rich , however , far beyond the Italian dining area and the retail stores and aim to go back to the country which he had to leave for as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know my people suffer .
&quot; I am planning a project for farmers from the poorest province of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as anyone else .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ ks also for@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul that are able to learn the packaging of packaging and preser@@ v@@ techniques . &quot; &quot; thus , they can sell their appointments on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development to successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but in the end stands stability and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ ks made this journey himself . well , he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path . &quot;
ne@@ ti@@ zen report : legislative dis@@ appearances in Egypt allow change of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan who has been in cust@@ ody for more than 900 days . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clearance of the camp of Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the removal of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ti@@ zen @-@ Report is an international snap@@ shot , of the challenges , victories and forthcoming trends in worldwide web @-@ rights &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian Parliament re@@ checks its law , which shows that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration on a government agency . &quot;
&quot; users would need to be able to use social networks within six months after successful legislation on the website of the authority under specification of their full name , as well as their number . &quot;
those who failed to have this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the execution of a pen@@ al payment .
&quot; the law , which was advertis@@ ed by sixty members of the Parliament today , lies at the legislative committee as well as the constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; May , another member of the Commission was to be introduced a bill in which the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the pro@@ clam@@ ation of the President or of a senior officials would be introduced . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law the insul@@ ting of the President as well as state institutions is already pun@@ is@@ hable . however , under the law , such an effect would have been practi@@ sed with pr@@ isons and fin@@ es , so the legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law shall be adopted , this can mean up to three years in prison for the condemned . &quot;
&quot; moreover , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 , while the Egyptian police officers went photograph that led to the military put@@ sch who had led to the elected President Moh@@ ammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited so as more than 700 protest , who were arrested by the same incident , four years in det@@ ention on a Jur@@ m@@ n . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed on 20 May , because the pr@@ isons of human rights groups did not fail to put the accused of prison in the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , the appearance of other fire@@ arms , illeg@@ ally assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
in another case a pen@@ se in G@@ iza said the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting to pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdu@@ ll@@ ah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa , and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , which have also been arrested during the previous incident , 25 years ago . &quot;
tun@@ ous activ@@ ist for pun@@ ched documents
&quot; in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the court of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has mainly been mat@@ ured into a le@@ ased action plan , which according to the Plan was specifically supported by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali preventing corruption to corruption , provided that all un@@ law@@ fully preser@@ v@@ aged funds would be returned . &quot;
&quot; the document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , takes a light on how pre@@ di@@ ales plans to support the law@@ suit . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia led the appointment of his sources as stated by Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press En@@ ables , which journalists f@@ usi@@ oned the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he entered the District Court of Tunis at the 9th of May as a witness . &quot;
does China comp@@ el the users of social media to present their credit cards ?
&quot; according to new regulations for the information office of the State council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users need social media to write or share messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the regulations , the registration has to be required with the full re@@ ual name . &quot;
&quot; an@@ al@@ ysts susp@@ ect that this is due to the elimination of anonymous comments in sub@@ types within social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities use these rules . &quot;
Chinese networks have proposed in social media to achieve these regulations only selective in order to protect the citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
May the state @-@ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Russia has continued access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ com@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ chat , joined the state government as the &quot; organizer of the information spread . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this name is part of a law of the year 2014 , thanks to which the Russian Government draws a list of online services that will organise the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law permits the removal of content , and to force them on request for the removal of user data . &quot;
&quot; these web sites are currently pages such as v@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ class@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia two most popular social networks ) , the image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the E @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and frag@@ rant other services . &quot;
Turkish Court features blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a tur@@ qu@@ oise dish had the block@@ age Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia , administr@@ ators to clear two German @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey support the jiha@@ dists in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication have been blocked because they work towards &quot; a information source , which works with groups to comp@@ ass a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey blocked the website completely blocked . it is in addition , besides China , one of the few countries around the world , where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
&quot; Britain can not stop , kill sli@@ pper@@ y &quot;
&quot; following this week , the government of Great Britain is in the midst of targeted consultation regarding increased monitoring , the internet service providers would force to monitor communications in real time and de@@ coding the back@@ door programs . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding proposal , but has other technological companies and the civilian population . &quot;
&quot; despite all the consultation , the consultation continues until 19 May . responses and suggestions by members of the public can be sent to the ministry . &quot;
