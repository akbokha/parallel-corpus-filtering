<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I have also grown up with American films, American music has been read and maintained American authors."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this land had such a profound effect on me that I was primarily journalist for an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Stuff, who covered the first Federal Court of judges, which were his interest to occupy them."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," mine was "as if the absolute truth is, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, had only enhanced my admiration for the USA."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I said:" America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting, that you can always be that you are, and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very blackish letter written about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about xenophobia and racism this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is to me how he goes with his lifter-minded.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops along the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks about how a former colleague put it, and openly explains his contempt for Muslims, latinos, AfroAmerican and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes which he won in the Republican elections, was the highest number, which has ever reached by the party."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support these bigotte personality I wondered?</seg>
<seg id="21">I was unable to reconcile his voters with the people who I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of journalism programme, people from all over the world is rising, a deep unbelieving person, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in addition, Trumps International illustrates not by Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball, and we spent many hours to watch the" Phoenix Suns "in the game."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to generosity that I lived with Sandy who lives for life long, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like their son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it still fits them with the commitment of Kristi, who is always with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of American lives."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there was Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those made by them emailed values of my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump's decision to nominate Republican presidential system, they offered me a grip and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps due to its contempt to non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the discussion with the idea that people have voted for Trump because they were either belonging to racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, broke me nearly the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump-voters as Rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"meeting people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an incapacity to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these electors, of whom are the most white, voted for Trump because they wanted to recover control of a country which she has disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they wanted to say that in this America they are still important?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who would look down with contempt to those who look different from it."</seg>
<seg id="41">"white" "whitelash" (..): as much as "" elongation of the white against all other ethnies "; terms of white in relation to whites and whiplash, which means so much as seudersad), as the big Van Jones called, has exactly the killed that America has so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people all over the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is nonetheless a powerful idea - what faith or background you may have, America is always welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this land chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyans, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"but with the choice of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the White America to say that promise: to hell with manifoldness, religious freedom and the entire concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back on the ruin."</seg>
<seg id="46">"with all of this, I have to think about Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who was fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowds.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a lautstrong" no! "</seg>
<seg id="50">"could Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" disarmament the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" I answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" "they called and their voices were laugh."</seg>
<seg id="56">"could someone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a consistent and lautstrong "NO!"</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan completed with the words:" "God is thanks, Mr. Trump, that is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected. "</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his Son was like, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps country, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a great garbage dump: only 16 oaks south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an ancient colonial city which is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from nearby prehistoric ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">"for some years now, La Banda de MÃºsica (Musicade) has now been playing in the municipality: one of the children and adults of an existing Symphony Orchestra, which has found an opportunity to overcome the surrounding poverty with their music instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for their drugs of abuse and the gangs."</seg>

<seg id="86">"in an article in Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez is reminiscent of a local ecologist and musician instructor of the children of Cateura, to the initial time:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first it was very difficult, because we had no place for rehearsals, and we had to teach at the same place where children had known no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them do not live with their children."</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fought the wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this article written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports international, practical solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication is done as part of an agreement with Global Voices concerning the sharing of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, at that time, was known that this ship was already operated in liberated waters of illegal fishing, before it sought the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"at this same time, East African countries were raised about accordingly and little to be welcomed to a legal brecher of these kinds at its coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized quickly against the ship. they refrained him to place one of their ports, and also refuse to give it a fishing association."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" Ursuddenly was the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply dismissed everything "," reminded Benedict Kiilu, a conductor of the Kenyan fisherman. he is part of a team that discovered the ship in itself and followed. "</seg>
<seg id="104">2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch the fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">"finally, it was also compelled to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of the pillage of the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegale fishing stop)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"the members of this network are alongside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries, which at that time expelled the Premier from their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" we have eight countries that are like-minded and working together. you can exchange information and stand each other wherever it comes to illegal fishing, "" says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden because of it is extremely difficult to split up. hence the illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing from regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">"intentional abuse of existing laws, to which certain habitats and types are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm, which have a delikates balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"however, while actions against illegal fishing industry were once formed due to bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail shell, with the information between individual countries, so the actions occur in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"in this way, the individual countries can exchange among themselves, like lists of existing licenses, news about suspected activities or details that can be noticed during a port spections or read."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea, by means of satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to mark ships, which fish in diluted areas. also let themselves discover so suspicious driving routes - such, that a ship relies its consolidated fish on other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"in the ideal case, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license, where they were traveling and possibly also whether they have a criminal register."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are opposed to illegal fishing, can refuse to refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports on basis of this information. and that the ships will not be forced to sell their cargo. and that they can even forced to the numbers of penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is then about considerable financial losses for the owner, what means that the illegal fishing activity is more financially worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, leading director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to win more estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover, which invade eight members of the network at ISH-i every year because of its illegal fishermen, which penetrate into East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"in East Africa, one of the most productive tuna-fish stocks, has led to the region's commercial fishing from around the world. among these also no illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include other activities including sailing under false flag, counterfeit licencers, indicating phantasies, the fish protected species and the fish in nature conservation."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they specifically utilise the lack of international co-operation and make the weaknesses of a complete control system;" "says Long." "earlier, a ship could have illegally fish and a country could then say 'you daring my harbor."</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say" Come to me "." "and exactly this legal hose is trying to close FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its foundation FISH-i has participated in more than 30 investigations of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has exposed criminal networks, which had fake licenses distributed in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has followed whispered shipments and found it."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing through major distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our studies lead us quite far into the networks organized crime "," says Bergh. "</seg>
<seg id="130">"he builds a system, which is to help the FISH-i, digest ships of precise places."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is always further developed, also helps to uplift the illegal ships that would like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position, "" says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, which deals with fishing data and FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems, so what they can no longer be saved by satellite."</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland helps to build a system that connects different information levels with each other. it aims to help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But there can actually influence FISH-i's team of African nations to react to the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing companies?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth opens together with Google and the Marine Reserve Oceana platform for Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data and by means of which the position of each traceable ship can be displayed worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "join forces with the neighbors to get a better picture of who what to do - that's just mind," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to join and combine their resources to the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global level." "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project to run, in which a global system allows the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only criminals, but they are also deterred."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that were confiscated with no license earlier and hardly to count on consequences, now they know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i participated in the meantime a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fissuring boats have more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia, Greko 1 had elaborated, Greko 1 found inspecs there, the inspectors found there on board tow ar whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries even notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "in West Africa each hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015 six countries joined together in 2015, called the West Africa Task Force. also they are now fighting the illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "With security is the goal, even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member of Somalia was released: in October it was Greko 1, a ship which was on the road under false flag. and not only the ship was used without a license and were used to tow ar ds that are now prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated its waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with taking resolutions towards Greko 1 set the strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative way working methods to protect oceans actually works throughout the world ocean.

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to overcount you need two important skills: passive knowledge, to understand the starting text and to use active language skills to transfer him to the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is case with native languages. in general, the belief that translators are in target language - not in the initial language - mother linguists should be."</seg>
<seg id="379">"thus, a French native speaker, for example, should be translated from English to French - not from the French into English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese firms do not employ workers with English as a mother tongue, which could make translations into English. this may well be traced to an understanding of the reasoning, cost-reasons or the relatively small number of English native languages."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies that don't have any foreign employees, have translations to make them work internally. then, the Japanese employee, whose English is considered the best-trained to be trained to translators - regardless of how good or bad his language skills are really good."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the worralled and puzzled phrases produced by machine translation, show that this technique has not yet been replaced by any human translator. this applies to some languages very special."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the most rare English formulations in Japan, including the enigenian prints, often used T-shirts or pockets, are only used for stylish reasons - not to be read or understand at all."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photos of Flickr-users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be neither acceptable nor acceptable, but by big companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, one can expect more careful translations."</seg>

<seg id="720">The customers view their plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic materials.</seg>
<seg id="722">"at the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there are a variety of these small companies that produce those plasticultural dishes that the German Filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago documented."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese people, these plastic materials are so frequent that they don't even realise them. a new trend however, however, transforms them in showy phone accessories and other gadgets."</seg>

<seg id="750">"the reporting on drug bosses like El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the chief of the Sinaloa-Kartell, urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, there is hardly anyone looking at the mourn or on the congregations that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind every morrow, behind every marry, behind every bone funds in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds might never be cure."</seg>
<seg id="753">"this is why the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico has called the digital project" "Aprena Vivir Con El Narco" "(German:" "with drug wholesale live") to give this sacrifice a voice and tells stories about people who grated in the fight between law enforcement authorities and cartels. "</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project so:</seg>

<seg id="772">Where should we get this? "</seg>
<seg id="773">"the editors of" "Aprena vivir con el narco" "explains why the project is so important:"</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid of. we have to show the international community the conflicts, disruption and governance."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in High-Risko areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a writer of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this input from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central-Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"your contribution reminds us that you should never see violence as normal, no matter what form it does:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with disease and sensation journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I'm coming every day to newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with pictures that actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from files of experts.</seg>
<seg id="781">It leaves me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">"sometimes I feel as if I am the One, which is appella or sad. it appears as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body once belonged."</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be equally valid or consider it as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he is scared (German: drug dealers) will be when he is great. and it is also not normal that people are hearing songs about the" heroism "of offenders, if they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me it is, as if they were those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they had such a thing."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness here when stories are to mere statistics in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the insomnia of men is incredible to me, when the death of six people and the disappearances of 43 students will be justified in a neighbour place that they were" soaking. ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they're trying to speak, that they remain unspared of such tragedies when they are not stirred and silent."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post" Four-month uption in the main town district: how a family with droplings was looted. in it, she describes how armed criminals destroyed money for month money from their business until they had not only demolished the business but also their family were torn apart. "</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain goes over again, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again if you are alone."</seg>

<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the more we are removed from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">It included their report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they are kidnapped or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I asked myself in these terrible days, if crying would dissolve my deep feelings, but the answers is no, because I forgot how to wept. I must learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: one of violence by violence.</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions like: who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man who was killed by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents worry about them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"bryan is a commodity and he tells you he himself had to teach yourself how to make a egg cooks, tortillas warm and" Chichi "for the kittens who live with it. this is his name for the preparation of the flaws with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are irrelevant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy who has to live all life out of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, one told him that his mother was vanished."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood has been past two years earlier, when he was just a few blocks from his home, the bloody corpse of his father saw that shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">As Bryan was born the situation in JuÃ¡rez was created:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence accompanied by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders for public safety and government of the United States Government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the Public Bar 3103 Morde. this corresponds to the incision of 8,5 Morden per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundred thousand-thousand stories that can leave organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Just a few stories live in view of the new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we cannot forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprena Vivir Con El Narco ", Animal PolÃ­tico 2015 has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against the drug trade, which present the country in the last four decades, in an intelligible form."</seg>

<seg id="841">"but the numbers could not be confirmed," "no one was back to count Leichen," said one citizen to Human Rights Watch. "</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were smashed or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite photographs could be shown that follow-up time.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack also remained unsolved but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt to gain the Boko Haram (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo has been converted back as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris. "</seg>

<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archeological sites in the world, was the crossroad of numerous civilizations and here merging Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began with this work, the IS would put everything about it, this architecture that not only embodied the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>

<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts out of the network, because it contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin or generally use as an adjective." "</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or" "Nature" "(in Burmese font) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radical nationalistic movements of the word has given an extremely reputable connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight real-language in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar is usually associated with racism, but the word itself does not appear to be an automatic language."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about the purpose of his use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"furthermore, there are several burial words with basic meanings that have the same letter as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, stool is written on Burmisch also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar Pae' (Spalternate), 'Kalar oat' (veil) or 'calarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>

<seg id="1309">"for example" "Kalar Htine" "(chair) and" "Kalar Pae" "(split)."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these three-legged nationalists, the oral language are spreading, a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcised its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all the oral language, the efficiency of this strategy may not last for long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and Wechat have proven that the censorship of keywords often gets a kittens and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks will just start to use a new word or alternative spelling of the word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung appeals to delete his posts, when he wanted to tell his friends only that the word" Kalar 'was banned from the social network: "</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook, I made a post office to share my Facebook-friends, that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited the Liken, post and parts of content for 24 hours, because the post" "Facebook community standards did not meet."</seg>

<seg id="1322">"Facebook likes a benevolent intention to decrease racism in Burma by their platform, but it doesn't work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">To draw up such words will only bring hatred among the different communities.</seg>

<seg id="1326">"if only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they have achieved, that would give them great sales, would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has been given for a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>

<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, there are women with great care to speak the names of their spouses, or even older men in the family."</seg>

<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini was pointed out in its panel, was the women of women who did not name their spouses."</seg>
<seg id="1482">"it has decided for this topic, because it wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify."</seg>
<seg id="1483">They don't speak aloud the name of their spouses is a bread which they all maintained and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman respected her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not redeem this, is considered a rear-term as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never had thought of so far to this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"beginning wanted to be Rohini, who had never called her husband at home before, at home as it works."</seg>

<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I was to call him on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in the luggage launched Rohini started her first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate "nor ever before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women."</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women who tried to bring discussion with an exercise in motion."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different emotions - happy, afflicted, sad, loving and so on."</seg>

<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her spouses over her lips," says Rohini Pawas out of the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the breaking of a centuries-old tradition, in the married women never allowed the name of their spouses.

<seg id="1501">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that she was going on during the entire exercise, and another decided to let the whole aned frustration for him and his family by going to curse him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ekstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"in the adrenalin exchange, having broken with an ancient brass, the women decided that they would actually attempt home to name their spouses in the name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"the husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put in his head, his wife could not stop his name."</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club-member chose to do it during dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she went up, she was afraid and said that there was an error."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," Rohini said, I meant to do it. "</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation emerged in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practices, such as carrying out the galvanic red point on the forehead, which shows the wedability:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would bear the galvanic point if he did."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I heard on wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women were not fully owned, but mean, they are now in a better position to choose for themselves, to do not bear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can replace their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we do a trip on each discussion."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want to make the women worry about who could hear what could hear," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"during the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and spoke and spoke about things, that they had never done before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years now and I have also talked about some things, for example like our identities to our spouses, never honestly speaking."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say certain things noisy, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have played just saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most is the alright, but some wanted a saline Kurta, a long shirt over a pants, wearing; they have not drunk."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of controversy and discussion about the merits of their own closets, morals connected with the saris and much more, decorate's own pair of Kurdish (upper hematized) into a discussion round, so that the women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they now decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure that they can create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"in question, whether in the five months since their first discussion club has changed something, Rohini, that things are slowly coming into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but listened to the name of their spouses."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some of me included, make it yet, but only if they are alone and are not members of the family members."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their spouses; only one or two women carry now at every time Zinnoberhey on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in the discussion club will know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the smuggle for more freedom of movement or their own clothes - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"but this prudent gives each of us the confidence that is going to change."</seg>
<seg id="1542">"and I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction, when every woman goes back home and told other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing."</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the video Volunteers community come from offset groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" messages of those who are experiencing themselves "," and provide a hyperlocal context to report on global human rights and development claims. "</seg>

<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a service capacity with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiphu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is the block of pornographic websites, from online scam, troughs and phishing pages to make users care about how much time they spend online, and to remote your home network."</seg>

<seg id="1972">"for instance, the" remote "state actors or even hackers can be able to manipulate the home network of a person or steal it."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to take control of digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while announcements of digital censorship in China most often focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote, reloed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme conditions and monitoring measures as well as routinemental Internet shutters."</seg>

<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days."</seg>

<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends the majority of his time inside, from time to his couch, to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"but what one can leave, is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine befted lips."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives on the top of his family house, which had been hearing them since 1967; in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family had forced themselves to escape from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as felahyeen (approximately: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for now six years Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and asks their old ideas about gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression by art and Rapidmusic."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, who often deals with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian Arab world, but also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all of these issues do not only lie in his hometown Amman Relevance but also in cities that are rich by Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as a person who in his mind is not restricted by borders, and he can feel loud upon his own statement with the people who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, the Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not reveal it openly, he put a special disinclination against the American foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib doesn't believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones, anything that was born with his identity as" Palestinian "Palestinian" of the second generation, "even though he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I do not think of my own life circumstances," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a man, while he shines into the waters of NescafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan, during that time it is provided for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordical law also testified that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee is hot in a sening hot juncag little with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the crutch of hot coffee and the swades of the Kent cigarette is in the nose first and foremost of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"Jordan, like a prison in the open sky above all, when you take a look at the neighboring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore it avoids easy to do basic things - how to drink water during Ramadan water - to not land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Department of Jordanian has announced a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the Islamic Action front - the Ottoman branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual Frontier was contradict the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert's concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former spokesperson in the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert "had just been cancelled due to sexual orientation of the proposition.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many in addition, the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activism that authoritate the well-approved legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila portrayed as" "progressive supporters of human rights" "which continue to work for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement may not simply be simply silently Rhetoric, but in fact a more and more evident to reflect the crystalline reality in Jordan which appear in Hdaibs plant clearly."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016 Hdaib traditional sex-men turned to Leibe, having formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have presitimate sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the image shows the skeleton of a apparently burnt-known woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red sea; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who were actually trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="2119">In Jordan the number of 'Honenmorde' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"human Rights Watch reached its peak in 2016 the number of honorary capacity in 2016 reached its peak. however, the Jordan is still missing to support Jordan, the victims of attempted murder and domestic violence to support an adequate manner."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law of disruption from the year 1954, women cannot be exposed to intra-family violence", "and for their release is often a long-term bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee of the family needed that the woman has nothing to happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs Music enjoys great popularity, and is well known not to shy away from themes in his country as taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is politically, but is fact that he is his music, the full explicit assures of sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot be separated from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, Mann."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"to me politics was articulated," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" "Lavla al 3aib" "and in" "Ghareeb" "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are in the core of politics can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016 Hdaib released a song with the title" "Santorano". ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a delay can be repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get in his words," what you want "- whether it is faith or non-faith, heterogeno- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that there is hardly anyone in Jordan concerning the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still being censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular Jujan's OnlineProgramme Roya to see later that his comments were torn out of the context and ceased his opinion censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib has grieve Hdaib open for the arabic LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals does not unlock the Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a Poets of the eighth century, which still has remained in memory thanks to its homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks herself: when Abu Nuwhat was to work later on behalf of the caliphate, in the eighth century openly were to write homosexuality, why can Jordan not be?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila, or the fact that the concert was canceled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Hashemitic kingdom, it is nothing new, that the government has sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are going to be silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the jordanic messservice held several former Governments and members of the teacher association, with the reason, they would have expressed criticism in social media critical about the problems that were rooted in deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this is the concert Hdaibs, according to that, only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress has been a continual give and taking. Jordan has now revered for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - it is like Hdaib - consists of slow, bedding and innermost changes. it is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the jordian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"finally, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs also, of a Arab world without interventions abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he doesn't just dreams of his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them to experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is affected by music, art and literature of a true and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, quarumunitions and on artificial nature of the guided democracies. at least hoppers."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it is, Hdaib will continue, and thus resist resistance."</seg>

<seg id="2152">"one thought that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory hates that the drums and dancing over more than a thousand years were passed, in the armies from Western Japan found the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi, to force in their knees."</seg>

<seg id="2182">The report will be published here in a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love-letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not much more important, people who make themselves feel engraved, affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"exactly this question went to the two young Colombian activists from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation, and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters for reconciliation), the young people do not endorse guerrilla's letters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently the country was a place of a historical event, and they wanted to contribute to their part. after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla warfare FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces in Colombia), which forms the clue of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"at the same time, International was considered to be the undersigned of the peace contract as so important that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos was awarded for its services to the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, in front of the columbians, there is a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla warriors who lived for many years in illegal bearings, had been exposed to war rhetoric, and around the clock to rest their weapons in order to integrate themselves back into life as a civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hate to guerrilla warfare, it must now take in her ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columbians would have to close together and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now have thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla war in order to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">"the purpose of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla, which should be transferred personally."</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose over the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, who took place in February 2017 in BogotÃ¡. there, Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to speak to the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this stated that we'd love the people we love, on Valentine's Day of lovemaking, but those forget that they need much unnecessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he will plan, he again spoke to share his love with people this year, who needed the warmest commitment."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"in such a plan, the plan, letters full of hope and support for former fighters of FARC to write now their place in society and must establish a new life." "the letters are prepared to say the Colombian society to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace," they say. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far as part of the campaign more than 2000 letters have been collected.</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla, and BogotÃ¡."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I have never thought that anyone would forgive '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on March 19th in one of the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students of the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo of the Foundation of BogotArt traveled in the camp to personally transfer the letters."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC had done so much as they had done before in order to assume the precepts of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders but letters full of care of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between them, "" told the political science student, JimÃ©nez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a staff of the Governors in the province of Valle del Cauca describing this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we passed the letters, a former fighters carried out by the camp of the Guerilla-fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" "Cambuches" "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla war live), I saw a guerilla, who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid of leaving, for beside him on the bed lay a MGL-Granatter, a deadly weapon in the thorn-brains."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I spoke to him anyway, and said," "Hi, what are they doing exactly?" he answered, "I answered a letter I wrote to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never before in my life, someone has written something so nice, so I gave me suddenly the tears over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I impoverished him completely and set me beside the pomegades.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"maybe he was sorry to be the war, I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. joining the FARC, the only way to keep him and his six brothers from hunger pd." I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes. "</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society there, who waits with open arms to us."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"up to now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace prevails, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"at the prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students had grown up all grown up as already war and the FARC already worked in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore the leaders of the FARC, the history of the organization, their ideals and gave an insight into their views about the peace process: for many years we have experienced the social injustice through the state into the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to contribute to a political party, we can contribute to creating society in this country."</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all the obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"listening to these people who had never been hearing the hearing so far and no voting right, and to recognize that people whom I have often seen as monsters and even hate, even people with nice feelings of living and their environment were very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the country lives, does hurt me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all men - including those who killed and so much damage, we can teach us a bit and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">"the columbians has been declared that after the draft peace, there would be peace."</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as it is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and job opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to access the weapons and to protest and to protest for their rights."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"for this reason we call all defenders of peace - regardless of race, religion or ideology - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence, will face many difficulties."</seg>

<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two keypoints in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in what condition have you been placed - in the men or women of women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name in it; but the doctor promised and put me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I was reading his name for the first time in his office, I got to do with the fear; it was a Muslim name, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has been respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got Drohungen.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - Related, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of an alpine space.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and several distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the required, to send me back to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they invited himself: some told me, I want to prove it by the streets of the street; others wanted that I had not changed my sex in Grosny, and say that I had not changed my sex, that all was just mud, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have set-size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how has your family tried to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people already spoke my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," You have brought a monster to the world that has not only your family but the whole of the Republic. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she lay down a strike around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors and rescue them were.</seg>
<seg id="2293">I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later in the window he stood a car with threaded window discs and a number plate with a number of 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after the third time happened, I realized that something was lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My husband's friends overbeat the numbering signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how have you been flying?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I will not want to reveal their names but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help, I left the country, but then a little disbelief."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mom when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought her, without register without permission, without all."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"I broke my old SIM card, and cast them into the trash."</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checs into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was listed on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I tasted the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"in the moment I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" you don't think about, you are sure, just because you have left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you do. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still stand in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about the gender equality yet, this is a tabby topic."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements I still wear in myself.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, this seelic barrier can not be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I say, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with a camera, I actually give myself trouble how the person looks out of her past - so remember my male."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I needed current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">"I spoke with someone, the one and a half months in the gun."</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during the Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not end a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"for that I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require a proof that the so-called" honour "has experienced through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are also being listed even pregnant men in these secret services?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of me says it wasn't so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then above all those who have no rich relatives, or who were dropped from their relatives in order to face Cadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they will be held there, so that they can present them later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim, they would have attacked any village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply missing but deliberately suppressed to radiate themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now just a mutation or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just threw someone who was imprisoned in Argun at a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people in this prison were vanished after their beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was no news of them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They have just taken them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"so called Lord, that person was even involved when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports until now. we assume that such actions are at all possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would you have not allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so called" "traditional" "orientation, already in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always carried my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think I was already known before 2003, when I was still living there - and I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the case of Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia was forced to lead us to the" "civilian paration", "but finally he finally cast us into the stoneage."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were exhausted; I had colored eyelashes, worsojeans and a short set."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The safety of the sharia has never bent me only a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before Russian theatre in Grosny, there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never sinned.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechnyan language there is a speech: Kharda ma Kharda. that is said: "Spelotte not over the unhappiness of another.</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often say it to children if it's about cranes funny.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so just have her eyes closed before you, because they believed, you are sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never sinned me, never hunted and never beaten. "</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this treasure time stopped?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow stood on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister 2005, he began to speak on the morals on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not say about us, but focuses on the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could feel like the people in the city began to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had formerly punched and punished at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"every time I got back home, I could feel like the situation in the Republic has been spared steadily."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I won't have much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Otherwise I still work as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">"currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacups, together, I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get foodies."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I do not waste a penny for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I stumbled away.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so is nature, it certainly has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"that is exactly the same thing as Chechnya, who want to make you clear with ham in front of the mouth, that there is no coils in them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have created the cabaret which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet there are they - but not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I come here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">"many of them - practicing Muslims, who go into the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live together with males."</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think of transidentity to men who love men and they believe that you alternate his sex to make more intimate experience. but that is a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation, to be precise, different settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed me for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry that I will be here so personal, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am now I myself.</seg>

<seg id="2410">Arab Awazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region in which a large part of the Arab Awazi community located in Iran was shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult to induce the native Arab population to curse its livelihoods."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"in a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was an predominantly autonome region in Iran until the Pahlavi-monarchy took over power and took over 1925 major efforts to stop ethnic autonomy in all Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest in Iran past oil and gas fields, as well as some of the most enlightening and most valuable commercial space for the Iranian agriculture."</seg>

<seg id="2437">"when I say I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put together well-thought scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we need to be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, that women nowadays still earn less money in spite of the same formation as men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">"that women are still under tight observation, when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body."</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is an epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women have come into a glaciously rock in the sooner or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on sex is still across the many different countries and faiths."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I am twice and three.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet, when I come to speak on skin colour, on racism, on black female-women, on black women in the LGBT community or on black women from the Diaspora, when I warn of what kind we have been physically, seelian and verbal abuse, a lot of white feminists and white intersectional feminists had to be silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">But anyway they all agree that women - all women should come together to take their voices and to sing 'Kumbaya' to sing my Lord 'to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about it that there is in addition to sexualised violence an institutionalized form racial or racist violence that we are exposed to black women in two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or in fact, black women and women of other ethnicities and country of origin earn less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">"the fact that black girls and girls are referred to as a white girl with an immigrant background, due to more obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women are exposed to a higher risk of women in black spheres, domestic violence and violence in black spheres, domestic violence and violence in the partnership, than white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand I want all women, all men and all men are tied to equal rights; on the other hand, I can not join in motion as a black woman, in whose centre the white woman is, who refuse to take into account both the gender and the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I am exhausted and will no longer fight my membership in a white-feminist-oriented sphere, which has always rejected me and many other black women."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"Sojourner said 1851 in their speech:" "I am not a woman?" "and also I refuse to maintain an ideology, in which the black woman is in historical respect a human and marginalized essence."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join me groups, which are also absorbing through cultural expropriation, our customs, and customs, in order to advance their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer seek to paralyze white women the importance of overcutting of skin colour and gender, as some of them will continue to hide the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to honor them for the better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intercultural feminism was founded to give women of different residences a home and get off from the white feminism, is still the word" feminism "in his name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I refer to it, fully and entirely from feminism and exclude me to the movement of Womanism, which is known for my dark skin and my status as wife's paradigm, which is so insistent, that Intersektionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever that we define black women based on our own ideas and let us move into the spheres, which will be created for us."</seg>

<seg id="2462">"although some white and interactive feminists are immediately calling separatism and exclusion, after having read these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement from which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a bluristic environment, I can uplift black women and women from other cultures, because in this paradigm I existed."</seg>

<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman moved their ad.</seg>

<seg id="2487">"once women are paid at all, they do not generally receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases women also depend on the men, dependent on them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence, at all in law enforcement authorities."</seg>

<seg id="2497">"according to the Maguayan Women's Minister, Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually displayed." "to any woman who are reimbursed to Paraguay for psychic abuse, 9 women who do not do this."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"every woman who reigned because of physical failure, two women who do not do this," explained it at the end of 2014. "</seg>

<seg id="2628">"this article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that covers solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 sorts, such as Outreddish, the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA-Astronauts in the space-area and consumed."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Mortons's work was confined working only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many saline varieties can get limits."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noted that more and more salads were patented, and that he could not continue to use them for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents tend not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special rotor or green, or curved sheets."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the last few years, more and more of such patents have been logged on more and more plants such as grain or map-sites. due to these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists are concerned about the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as an impassioned representative of a millennia of tradition, Morton is still a salad, but it takes a lot longer because his work is getting more and more and more complicated."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It's like would lying in a river a rock where I have to kill.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to make that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think that these patents go to salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before judgment, no one can breed any more of a new salads, because all the features are patented, so he is trying to recover those features that he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and makes every effort to use material which is protected as intellectual property."</seg>

<seg id="2643">"it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area, and not from the field of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for" Open Source "-seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free" Open Source "software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was launched into the life to ensure that some plant species and gene are not protected as intellectual property, and are permanently usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"within the framework of the initiative, in short Ossi, US-breeder can commit to that others were able to use them seeds freely."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that with their seeds, do not continue to do business and sell it." open source "breeders only allow others to breed their seeds, to breed for so own varieties, and it is not immediately uttered - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patente."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy views</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emented professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-Vorspanning Jack Kloppenburg, control over seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food safety and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter or not only little by maximise seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open source" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." "who is offered to our goal of ecological sustainability," "who is offered good, local and sustainably more frequent sizing foods in August and September 2016, should also know that the way is bred as the vegetables, such as this vegetables is bred."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"disparity without seeds, is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative will also commit themselves to further their seeds at their disposal. thus, you can also be patented in contrast, seeds and plant-features."</seg>

<seg id="2657">"Ossi Super argue that the future of food supplies is jeopardy, since the available genetic pool due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights based on plant material, which is thus becoming more restrictive, unchangeable."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, Executive director of the Ossi, has engaged in her PhD-work with genetic variation with carrots and their availability. she found that about a third of all cartels-characteristics is protected as real estate, thus making it available for plant breeders either at all or not only."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there are such estimates not yet, but experts like Luby suspect that massacres are patented in even larger style as salads or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of point of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from such, through which their taste or colour increases up to such a result, due to which they prosper in certain environments, and threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents by patenting on the plant characteristics suggest that the available plant material for breeder by becoming more and more patents. genetic variety is now but necessary than ever since changed conditions by climate change are much worse than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-Speaker Carly Scaduto, that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos's activities. with a total of four co-banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is preparing for the conservation of the genetic variety."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that the intellectual property of other breeders boots, as" patents and the protection of plant variances are promoting innovation. "" a patent is essentially taken a plan that everyone can follow, as soon as the patent is expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to reach the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not impede innovation, but encourages it to be provided by the public to provide more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees the other way: 20 years to wait until a patent pumping, is certainly not innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have so long waiting for waiting, to grow in plants that have been adapted to changing environmental conditions, you could have lost the battle already."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is however that genetic resources must always have been a common good and continue to stay:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monary incentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what motivates us, and it will make us impossible if we do not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton does not disturb themselves to the concept of patterned plant-mal:" we do not create the features themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants are themselves formed by themselves and as breeders we ultimately have no idea how the plants do it.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the U.S. state Oregon and Ossi preamplifier, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" who is an Sorte, bred also its own values into it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large courtyards and monoculturists, who needs to be necessary for their cultivation of herbicide, in its varieties of this concept of farming."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is as accurate. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium sized companies (such that have to move on international markets, but smaller than for example Monsanto are) patents create, it will manage the most smaller plant breeding companies, even without patents, either reject them or keep it expensive and therefore not rewarding or both."</seg>

<seg id="2682">"I need a constantly new material for my catalogue, since I know that my rivals are selling my varieties in a couple of years ago," says it. "with a patent is 20 years ahead of competition, which makes it very pretty easy to do." "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"in fact, the US appear to be a leader in the" Open Source "in breeding, but the concept spreads rapidly around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, "which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, an open source plant breeding program works together with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties, fulfilling specific requirements."</seg>

<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016 the executive powers of the European Union, the European Commission declares that conventional plants should not be patentable. thus, this speaks to itself against the current practice of the European patent Union, patents on conventional plants."</seg>

<seg id="2726">"HRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities concerned over two months ago, such as the independent post-hand MADA Masr, arabo-language issue of Huffington Post, and that from Qatar from Al Jazeera, because of" "support of terrorism".
