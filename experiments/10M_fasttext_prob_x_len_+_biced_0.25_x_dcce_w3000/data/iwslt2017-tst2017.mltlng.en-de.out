this is James R@@ isen .
they perhaps know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize .
&quot; long before anyone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he was spectacular , that the N@@ SA heard illeg@@ ally teleph@@ ones from Americans . &quot;
&quot; it is another chapter , which should leave a lasting impression . &quot;
&quot; in that he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence surgery , where the CIA has literally under@@ gone the idea of Iran for an atomic bom@@ b . &quot;
if the crazy sounds like you can read it .
it is an incredible history .
but do you know who the chapter did not fall at all ?
the U.S. government .
almost 10 years the government has established against R@@ isen and call it to call its in@@ comparable sources .
&quot; in this train , it became a symbol for the pattern of government , wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers and pun@@ ches journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the first constitutional agreement , the media have the right to publish their secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right when media do not get this information , and if they can not protect the identity of the mud that they can inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; so when the government came with R@@ isen , he did something that many brave re@@ por@@ ter already did before him : he refused , and said that he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , he lived with the risk of going into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , though for years , though she would have been indispensable for their case , the demands of the government were dropped off . &quot;
the reason : in time electronic monitoring the re@@ por@@ ter and sources can be less hidden .
&quot; instead of fail and bringing cr@@ amp@@ ons to the statements , that also could do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , his phone sp@@ elling justi@@ fiable , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit card , and even travel documents with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to be Jeffrey Ster@@ ling , a CIA , wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers and ris@@ ome source , to judge . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama spoke with his attachment , to protect wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers . however , the judiciary has more condem@@ ns more than all U.S. governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government did a lot from their work as a secret . &quot;
since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers to a journalist .
&quot; so we are pressing the press work , which is to be protected by the first constitutional account because the government has more and more possibilities , all sp@@ y . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology is allowed to deal with the rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and they may do that from the moment they contact , instead of in retro@@ fit , in the witness . &quot;
&quot; there are communication software that has not yet been written as R@@ isen his book , and it is much safer than regular e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source @-@ source system for wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers , which was originally developed from the website of the website , which was originally developed by us , and is today from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I work . &quot;
&quot; mail an e @-@ mail , go to a news page , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can send documents up@@ loaded or send information , just as with each usual contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server that is only the respective message agency access .
&quot; so , the government cannot receive more information secre@@ tly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
&quot; Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole , to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world develop new sp@@ y technologies that end@@ anger us all . &quot;
&quot; it is an obligation to ensure that not only technology , such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to reconc@@ ile mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the nearest wh@@ ist@@ le @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; the more than ab@@ norm@@ alities in the care of soldiers hum@@ d knows and wish to report crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm for the contaminated water of Fl@@ int suggests . or a pilgri@@ m@@ street insi@@ der , which war@@ nings us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover the crimes , but to protect our lives of all constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&quot; &#91; on 3 April 2016 the biggest Daten@@ l@@ eck of History has been published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; has been hidden in the &quot; &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; , &quot; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we were made of news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the law firm in Panama law such as Fon@@ sec@@ a . &#93; &quot;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up your setup ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works , as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
islands Prime Minister has come back .
&quot; also , there are reports that a fo@@ e of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad Brief@@ ing @-@ Assad in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it is argu@@ ing that a trace of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russia President Vladimir Putin , through a close friend of children &apos;s ages , a famous cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people out there , and others that are nervous over the next release , and the next un@@ covered documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the plot of an agency gri@@ lled or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham .
&quot; it seems crying out of you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we address this ?
&quot; but the truth is , if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not all of their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenomen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens are used by some few to hide and dev@@ out their assets -- something that we have been discussing and reve@@ aling it for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seems highly conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work . &quot;
I always ask myself like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who behind these prayers . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for comp@@ iling and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what matters is . &quot;
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
&quot; presum@@ ably , because there have been no prominent Americans now that occurred in these revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; well , it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; however , by the principle , after which these tax hav@@ ens work , has Mos@@ o Fon@@ sec@@ a less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we would have a plot from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some US states you need less information to provide less information to create a company than to get a libr@@ arian note . &quot;
this type of transparency in the US has allowed its employees to take away from school districts .
it has not allowed to remove any particular amount of investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here with Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this is in practice .
how does that work ?
&quot; so , we sent a covered bro@@ ker into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan . &quot;
&quot; our investig@@ ators gave himself a African minister , who wanted to bring the suspic@@ ious money into the U.S. to buy a house , yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really sho@@ cked it really , that all up to an attorney at our disposal proposals made , how to transfer@@ ed his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all precau@@ tions . none of these lawyers participated as clients , and of course , nobody was handed over to money , but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer that has broad@@ ened our co@@ vert proposals .
it is not about a single leader of leaders in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; it is about how the system works , by the corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability . &quot;
&quot; and in order to cope with this , we need to change the rules . &quot;
we have to change the rules to ag@@ grav@@ ate this kind of behaviour .
&quot; this may sound quite a bit wei@@ rd as if we could not do anything against it , as if nothing ever had ever changed , as if there is always the rich and most powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a born , I really see that some things have begun to change . &quot;
over the past few years we have seen far @-@ off towards more transparency which concerns the owners of companies .
&quot; the topic found political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; since then , the EU captured in central regi@@ sters at the national level , who truly lies behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have launched a draft resolution in both Parliament , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama disclosure , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means being used to ensure greater transparency in the US and global . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; we need ordinary people , which are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ quartered . &quot;
&quot; we need executives in the economy which are open and say , &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and campa@@ ign@@ ing for it to end through laws this type of transparency . &quot;
&quot; together we can finally finish the in@@ difference which now makes these kinds of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I was kidn@@ apped almost once and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ et . &quot;
&quot; one day after I finished my design study , I did a back@@ pack . &quot;
&quot; a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained , and watched my stuff . &quot;
he bought one of my artwork .
&quot; he was alone in the city , and just made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards , he would go to the peac@@ cor@@ ps . &quot;
I invited him to a beer . he told me the way he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where do you get there tonight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I do not know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought : &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what am I now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I now have to offer a sleeping place ?
&quot; but I did not come to know him ! he said , he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I will not kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ land ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard myself saying : &apos; I have a air mattress . you can sleep in my living room .
&quot; one voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was in bed , I went up to the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what got me built @-@ in ? &quot;
a wild estr@@ ang@@ ement in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I was given such a fear that I got out of the bed , at the tenth to the door , and my sleeping room door lock . &quot;
but he was not ins@@ ane .
we are still in contact .
&quot; the artwork , which he had bought from me is hanging in his classroom . he is now a teacher . &quot;
it was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my angle .
&quot; maybe people who were sold to me in childhood as stran@@ ger , actually friends , who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; to accommodate people on my air@@ mattress , it was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a time jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m out of a job , almost pl@@ ough , my ro@@ ommate is moving and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were booked .
&quot; I think creativity can create it , fear in fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have overwhel@@ med how we can earn something about it . our apartment comes to a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
&quot; they found it great , and we too . &quot;
&quot; I am sure , our cheese ham brus@@ qu@@ ette tastes completely different , because we made them for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we met our last guest and the door came into the castle , rigi@@ d Brian and I call . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came into roles .
&quot; my former ro@@ ommate , N@@ ate Br@@ arc@@ zy@@ k , joined us as developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
&quot; we presented our Invest@@ ors : &quot; we want to create a website on which people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms , their doors , whose doors are closing when a visit is gone . &quot;
over the internet they can then invite to invite you to overnight in them .
it will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the rocket would ign@@ ite .
&quot; indeed , they are not . &quot;
&quot; no one who is still very con@@ sol@@ ation , would invest in a shop , the stran@@ ger allowed to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we all learned as children that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
if you have a problem you get to the things that you can good . we were able to di@@ gest .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we had learned that design much more is than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to di@@ z@@ nt objects , but now we wanted to create confidence by an immense trust between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create with design confidence ?
I would like to give you a che@@ du@@ ling to which degree confidence we asp@@ ires .
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I &apos;d like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
type your un@@ solic@@ ited mobile phone to your left seat .
&quot; this quietly excursion of panic , which you now sense -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door first . &quot;
&quot; because the only thing , which is even more personal than your mobile phone is your home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your text , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel like to un@@ lock the phone &apos;s cell phone in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
so most guests feel when they will stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company cannot exist .
only once so , who does actually have Al Gor@@ es mobile phone now ?
could you pre@@ ach on Twitter that he is capable of President of the President ?
you can now return the cell phone now .
you now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour was presented only once with his name : if he had told wh@@ ence he comes , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you could have 150 Be@@ es@@ sm@@ ents that all say : &quot; he can really cl@@ ing very well and guess wr@@ ys ! &quot;
how would you feel when you would have to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ designed feedback system strength@@ ens the confidence decisive .
at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was difficult for the people to dis@@ solve negative ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents .
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both host and guest had made their jud@@ g@@ ments before we placed them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how they are similar to old and home . &quot;
somewhat surprising we trust the people most who are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social occurrence .
exciting is it when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case through evalu@@ ations .
&quot; if one has less than three divisions , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but , one has more than ten , changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation is in common .
the right design can thus help us overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted pre@@ dil@@ ections .
&quot; in addition , we experienced that confidence depends on how much one can expect from them . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; when you tell too little things , like &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; , &quot; you are not getting any answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells you how for example : &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother -- &quot; &quot; -- the request is also rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; T@@ olle &quot; works in your apartment ! I do with my family vacation . &quot;
how can I create it with design to produce this degree of openness ?
&quot; we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct quantity of text , and we also give tips on what subjects to write something . &quot;
&quot; our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help , overcome our prejudi@@ ces against stran@@ gers . &quot;
&quot; what we had not reck@@ oned , was the vast amount of people who were more than ready to submit these prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
here you see how many people use our offer .
one can see three things .
firstly : incredibly good luck .
&quot; second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team . &quot;
&quot; third , a need that was not covered beforehand . &quot;
for us the business is running very well .
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything is running smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have allowed un@@ authorised parties or apartments devast@@ ated .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
&quot; I stood at the front line , if trust was broken . &quot;
there is nothing worse than these calls . it already hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
&quot; the disappointment that you hear in the voice of c@@ aller , and will always be our greatest motivation to improve ourselves further . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , by the 123 million sold accommodations only a fraction of a problem . &quot;
for people trust each other right .
&quot; if confidence works , it can be a miracle . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack .
his host was driving him to the hospital .
he even ended blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travelers who tend to tend to carry out their heart attack .
the area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Al@@ ej@@ andra are real protective angels who save a life , even though they don &apos;t know at all . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass . &quot;
&quot; because they do not want you feel lonely , they bring books over . &quot;
they can even stay longer without the extra @-@ nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay is running . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure money trans@@ action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled for the first time about this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions together ?
it is about an economic trade .
&quot; but it is simply called &quot; &quot; Rental industry &quot; , &quot; the cause will not do justice . &quot;
&quot; Share Economy describes a trade , the human relationship promises . &quot;
people create a part of themselves openly and that changes everything .
&quot; when you travel nowadays , this is to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but to do so less auth@@ en@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; but what would be , if travelling a rich buffet of local impressions would be ? &quot;
&quot; what if at any place you visit , a group there and announ@@ cing it to show you thoroughly and show one with a bar pent@@ ine neighborhoods where one has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would like to shape the apartments from the bottom to another ?
how would this look like ?
what if cities would assume the idea of a common share ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ eliness and de@@ preci@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in the South East of Seoul , this project has already been started . many parking spaces that belong to the government , &quot;
&quot; were now offered by inhabitants . students who were looking for a bond , &quot;
were convey@@ ed to people whose children were moved out . they were started In@@ cub@@ ator programs .
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . about our platform alone , at night 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be a host or even a host . &quot;
so the idea seems to be so crazy about how we were joined .
we did not have invented the wheel .
hospitality was also previously mentioned .
there were some similar sites to us .
so why did our work ?
&quot; aside from luck and Tim@@ ing , we realize that one can find the right design with the components of the trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome pro@@ ver@@ tured prejudi@@ ce .
I find it amaz@@ ement ;
straight to overwhelming .
I have to think every time when a red Maz@@ da goes to me .
we know of course that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us if there was this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think if you watch me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or suppres@@ sed , a bra@@ ins under@@ went , a terrorist attack ? &quot;
or simply a delay in safety at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
&quot; so , the media represent people who look as like me . &quot;
one study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans mean that most would not know Muslims .
probably the people do not speak with their drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee @-@ player -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
I am both intro@@ ver@@ ted ;
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ s @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born . &quot;
I decided to do this .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to see me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslim . I chose Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head@@ gear . &quot;
my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends was horri@@ fied : &quot; why suppres@@ sed you yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the Lus@@ tige was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ att@@ ain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only adopted passive the faith of my parents .
I did with the Quran .
&quot; I read it , thought , thought , un@@ question@@ able , and believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow surrender that deep@@ ened with any reading of the cor@@ relation .
the beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to tears .
I realise myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; had you ever feel that somebody you perceive , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
this is how it feels like .
&quot; later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as engineering . &quot;
&quot; later I had , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had at an end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Eil@@ er &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes in buildings , people sp@@ ill from the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly into indi@@ gn@@ ation .
why should we do something ?
&quot; I joined the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... ji@@ had ... , ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bs Mecca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it was not only attacked my country , but in the N@@ u turned me the actions by others from a civil society into a suspic@@ ious . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to go through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start building study . &quot;
&quot; I remember as I went away -- as we were speaking -- as deeply it went into my seat , and I feared the first time as Muslim . &quot;
we moved this night to our apartment in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; and then heard , saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations that said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d w@@ aking , &quot; &quot; bub@@ bling in well illuminated areas &quot; , &quot; Ver@@ sam@@ mm@@ elt not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then we became Friday in the week -- the day when Muslims gather to bed .
&quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; goes not on this first Friday , the mosque could be a destination . &quot;
I saw this extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims and from people who thought for Muslims , and sm@@ ashing down . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay home .
but something felt not right .
&quot; because people who have attacked this land , attacked our land . &quot;
I postpon@@ ed the anger of people on terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to have to be explained to the constantly .
&quot; I have nothing to ask questions , I love questions . &quot;
they are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; today , we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot;
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as of a tum@@ our in the body of the USA .
only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor be removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ our only under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are like all other Americans , no tum@@ our in the body of the US , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Er@@ sth@@ el@@ fer and Olympi@@ oni@@ ons . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques make it safer ?
&quot; it may be a few parking spaces , but not stop terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to people &apos;s other faith toler@@ ant , and to show greater citizenship . &quot;
&quot; and , as a head of the police in the Washington , DC recently told , people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are opened in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
&quot; in the radic@@ alization process , one finds that it &apos;s online . as a First the person is cut off from their church , that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor , or of faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we need to stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some are still asser@@ ted that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS founded their brut@@ ality with the Quran . &quot;
&quot; Muslims , as mother , as a person , I believe we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; yet , we would add to her imagination , if you acknowledge them as representatives of 1,6 billion believers . &quot;
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x Kl@@ an by Christianity .
&quot; both groups asser@@ ted their ideology prevailing in their &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but when you cast a look at it , it does not drive what she is blo@@ wn in her &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that makes them read these things into the scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding I@@ mam told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she imagined to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radic@@ als religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the reverse . every cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken , she brought her to silence and said her that her wrath , her sense of injustice in the world , she would only bring in trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing , and something that had given mind to her mind , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts that gave her a solution . &quot;
this I@@ mam made the connection to God and their church again .
instead of blame for her hum@@ ility he showed her constructive paths for a real change in the world .
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , she stopped to join the IS before . &quot;
it was an insight as to the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family .
but how does normal Americans affect ?
how does it affect every other ?
how is the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day for our democracy - to our thought of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear we happen at least three things .
&quot; we accept a author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formity and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study indicates : if one disco@@ urses the news , in which negative reports have been reported on Muslims , they have more military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circum@@ c@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just a academic problem .
&quot; when you look , when the mood against Muslims moved to the above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two choices .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem @-@ terror , as I expected it . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool for mani@@ pulation of the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well @-@ informed citizens . &quot;
the handling of Muslims is an early war@@ mark .
perhaps we feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear treats us all .
&quot; in the assignment of coll@@ ectiv@@ ism , it is not just about to explain themselves to themselves . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , un@@ married couple , who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; he was on the dental faculty , talented , much promise ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet , generous man , whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was struck and said :
&quot; when is such a sav@@ our@@ y young man , such a sav@@ our@@ y young man ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne in her brother and his wife , her neigh@@ bor , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , they mur@@ dered , as well as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an which was in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution , after declar@@ ing statements against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he enjoyed eight times in De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
let &apos;s go back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or stayed safely at home ?
&quot; we find it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave our children , one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we decided to take the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s quarter , we went to the Mos@@ que , with high pressure on the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , my shoes went out , went to prayer all , and what I saw , left me to hold . &quot;
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
&quot; I@@ mam made an announcement , than@@ ked , and called our guests , because half the congreg@@ ated were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , who had come , not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
at this moment I am coll@@ ap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what are you choosing at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you sure to get it safe ?
or you will join those who mean : we are better than that .
many thanks .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have taken a nerve .
&quot; but I wonder what do you say those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ talk , a mind@@ set with dr@@ au@@ ght , thus an exception , and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say f@@ ool you . I am totally normal .
I am not an exception .
my history is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is permitted .
&quot; when you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did so with the greatest study of Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I do not have an exception .
&quot; if people like an exception to rule , then the rule is broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what started as a platform for craf@@ ting , will be shortly before , to become a billion store . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dru@@ mm@@ ers . possible , the research institutes are made worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air condition to penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six meter high tower from 1 500 brick and a few years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; by joining the aircraft , reach high speed and spe@@ eding up to the narro@@ west room . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ sufficient structures .
they have learned to carry loads to deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally respond to natural laws .
&quot; today , we would like to show you some of our new projects . &quot;
our goal is to exceed the limits of the Pos@@ sible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system of aut@@ on@@ om , it needs to know collectively , where in the room the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ETH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alised technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a off@@ springs of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
each plane has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; external commands are available at the highest level e . B. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter , &quot;
&quot; one airplane , that is trying to strike two flies with a cap . &quot;
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance flight , much more efficient than helic@@ op@@ ters in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can swing , and has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
however there is always a down@@ side .
&quot; a restriction of tail@@ gate is that they are sensitive to tur@@ mo@@ il , such as windsurfing . &quot;
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the airplane doesn &apos;t matter at which position the optimum position can be reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research we often introduce basic abstract questions which pre@@ ach to the core of the matter .
one such question would be for example : what is the small amount of movable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons why you want to know the answer to such a question .
helic@@ op@@ ters are known around as machines with a thousand movable parts that join forces to hurt you .
several decades ago trained pilot @-@ controlled aircraft were able to fly only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear .
&quot; long ago , we discovered that flies with just one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the monopol@@ ist , the mechan@@ ically simpl@@ est TV , and it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ ank , hing@@ es and ru@@ mp , no further actu@@ ator or insp@@ ectors , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , happens in the inside very much so that it can fly stable and move in space . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorith@@ m of the tail@@ gate . to bring it to the compart@@ ment , I need to have it right . &quot;
&quot; the lik@@ eli@@ hood of throw it right when all watch , is low , so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; when the moon is an exercise in gene , this machine is here , the om@@ is@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ants , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what do you do with all this flu@@ ence ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ ric .
therefore it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; thereby , he receives the in@@ decent ability , &quot;
&quot; move in the room in all directions , no matter what direction it is filmed or even as it rotating . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers from eight prop@@ ell@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; some things are visible in models , the rest is learned directly from flying . &quot;
let us see this too .
&quot; if flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller engines .
this turn in clo@@ ck@@ wise clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
&quot; when they build them , they act like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something wrong goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller falls , the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine even if limited . &quot;
we will demonstrate that by taking a half of air@@ planes .
the last demonstration is examined synthetic tur@@ mo@@ urs .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , co @-@ ordin@@ ated units enables a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
&quot; we participated in the Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one disc bread -- and provide them with loc@@ alised technology and algorithms . &quot;
&quot; every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no limit . &quot;
hopefully you will motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine since it does not want to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
it is of course difficult to pre@@ di@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types as us lies the reward in the development and creation .
&quot; it serves as a memory , how wonderful and ench@@ anted our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever gifts to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential it is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago killed in a very distant galax@@ y , two black holes are getting faster , they turned into a tenth of three in a tens of tens in a tens of tens . &quot;
this short moment bright@@ ened them bri@@ ghter than all stars along with all galax@@ ies of the entire known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy do not put them in form of light --
we are finally talking of black holes .
the entire energy was given into space @-@ time @-@ cycle itself and the universe is explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events in a time .
1.3 billion years ago there was a multi @-@ cell life on Earth .
&quot; since then , the earth has brought a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ rs , people and -- God stand at us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; for about 25 years ago , a group of particularly cour@@ ageous - R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , K@@ IP Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- to build a huge laser det@@ ector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are created by col@@ li@@ ous black holes . &quot;
most were they regarded for crazy .
&quot; but enough people realized it as a crazy gen@@ ies , so that the US National Science Foundation funded their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector LI@@ GO : the laser @-@ inter@@ fer@@ ometer @-@ gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves atory . &quot;
&quot; during the follow @-@ up time , the precision of LI@@ GO could considerably increase the amount of recognition . &quot;
that &apos;s why you now call him Advanced LI@@ GO .
at the beginning of September 2015 LI@@ GO was started for a last test run by some minor , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ating black holes through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott H@@ ugh@@ es : only two moments in my life are emotional as this :
the birth of my daughter
and the departure from my to@@ d@@ ill father .
&quot; basically , they were the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; all that which I had worked , is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott H@@ ugh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cists on MIT . he studied for 23 years of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their through observ@@ at@@ ories such as LI@@ GO measurable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a c@@ row in the texture of space and time .
&quot; on the tran@@ sit@@ ing of the wave , the space and its whole content is stretched in one direction and turned into the other . &quot;
&quot; to illustrate , faculty in Kur@@ sen to rel@@ ativ@@ ly theory often have a correct liter@@ al dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each of us was stretched on the waves of the waves and over@@ sh@@ out . the stretching of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st Dar@@ um , one told the LI@@ GO staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re laser Det@@ ector , and this is absurd , this length would have to be measured less than a thousand of the radius of an atomic kern@@ els . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about gravity .
&quot; described K@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of LI@@ GO@@ s , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are extensive . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are emerging , and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to LI@@ GO . Scott will@@ ingly , LI@@ GO is more than an eye than an eye . &quot;
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial hair , the size of your mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; that is quite handy . because in this way , you can make an image or a map of things by taking the light of the coming light around you . &quot;
in the notes is that different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; it is therefore very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that will give you particularly much : &quot;
the face of your child around .
&quot; instead , we lau@@ gh at certain properties like tape and height , rhythm and volume to close the history behind it . &quot;
&quot; now she is talking Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; yes , Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot produce simple pictures of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by watching changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least lie for LI@@ GO the chis@@ eled frequencies in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so , when we convert the wave @-@ patterns in locks , we can hear the All literally . &quot;
the engra@@ ving to listen can tell us about a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes that my colleague Scott has very long been busy .
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ speed holes , circul@@ ates simple : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
turn the two body very fast and it sounds the same circle with an additional ton@@ ic . this sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u !
it is a kind of movement and shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form .
&quot; AA : on 14 . September 2015 -- a date , which at least I will never forget - heard LI@@ GO fol@@ lower : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ der@@ noise &#93; J@@ em@@ and , who knows what he must hear , recognis@@ es this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which is about as fast as the sticks of your mix@@ er . &quot;
AA : considering what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dicht@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , revol@@ ve each hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know that because we have heard it .
there is the permanent meaning of LI@@ GO .
LI@@ GO p@@ aves a completely new way to investigate the Al@@ ls as it had never before possible .
on this road we can listen to the universe and the invisible .
much in all we can -- practical or basically -- not visible .
&quot; a Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why mascul@@ ine @-@ stars in super @-@ nov@@ ae will explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; the exciting physical processes do occur however at the core , which is hidden behind thousand kilometres of iron , carbon and si@@ lic@@ on . &quot;
we will never go through since these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be more transparent glass . the Big Bang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it as the Big Bang is covered by his own offspring . &quot;
&quot; using the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to back up to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most importantly : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen before and of which we have no idea of what we can only discover , by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , LI@@ GO found immediately at the first step things we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this topic : ME : the type of stars , the black holes are ob@@ serving as LI@@ GO they are observed are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are the ho@@ vering for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; LI@@ GO offers us a completely different angle of view of the events in space , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is to be as cour@@ ageous as possible .
&quot; thanks to LI@@ GO we know how to build great det@@ ectors , the noise and p@@ aves of the universe . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ at@@ ories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ at@@ ories on Earth and in space .
&quot; for what could be more beautiful , than the Ur@@ b@@ ang itself ? &quot;
now is the time of great dreams .
dre@@ aming with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
for a year I would say yes to all &quot; Yes ! &quot; before I feared .
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , me in unpleasant situations , I forced me to say yes . &quot;
I wanted to speak in the public domain ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
would I be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
would I start playing with the spectacle ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly that , w@@ ov@@ or I feared , was my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear to keep speaking , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain yes , that my life was deeply changing , awaiting an unexpected . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; cookies , &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; kitt@@ ens , I need milk for my beak . &quot;
she once asked me if I could play with her when I was straight on the go . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; of a new attitude to my family . from there I thought to me always to play with them once you ask me . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I say yes , every single time . &quot;
&quot; fast . I am not perfect , but I settle very much . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has a surprising side @-@ effect : only recently , I actually understood that the &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to play with my children my career was saved . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things out of you to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I Cre@@ ate TV . I reproduce television .
&quot; I make television , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for preparing 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each programme offers hundreds of jobs that previously did not exist .
the budget for an episode of a TV volume can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days times four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollar television , four television programs , three broad@@ cast@@ ings , three episodes , 16 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series are running on Thursday night .
my series will run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spect@@ ators .
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts , which I have created myself , and not only produced , so still above . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and to share my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire that burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who that still does ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I would not like to impress you with this .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think if the word &quot; author . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I say it to you so that all of you who work so hard if you are talking about a company , a country or a classroom , I take you to understand that I don &apos;t just talk on computer and f@@ antasi@@ es , and it &apos;s true when I say , I understand that there is no dreams in a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , everything welding -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work hard , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am deep@@ ened in work , there is no different feeling . &quot;
my work is always creating a land out of nowhere .
&quot; it is , when I set troops up , when I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; so , you get a high tone , running a marathon . &quot;
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ern@@ al , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the bu@@ zz . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work is running well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz stops like a busy road , I could always drive on it . &quot;
&quot; many people take the bu@@ zz , that I &apos;m writing them writing , that writing me joy . &quot;
&quot; do not understand me wrong , this does . &quot;
&quot; but the sums -- when I started working with television production , when I began to work and work and to work , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy . the bu@@ zz ! &quot;
the amount is more than writing .
the tot@@ als is action and activity . the tot@@ als is a drug .
the sums is music . the sums up is light and air .
the bu@@ zz is the voice of God in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz then you can not seek anything differently from the size .
&quot; the feeling that cannot be different than to seek , no matter at what price . &quot;
this is called the sums .
or perhaps it also means a work@@ a@@ holic to be .
maybe it is genius .
maybe it is ego .
maybe it is the fear of failure .
I do not know .
&quot; I just know that I am not going to fail for the failure , and I just know that I love the bu@@ zz . &quot;
&quot; I will only tell you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; to make a clear : the more successful I will , the more transmis@@ sions , the more the more winter@@ s , the more work there , the more work there , the more I write down , the more I write history , the more expectations I give . &quot;
&quot; the more I work , to be successful , the more I must work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the land , which I managed , the marathon , the I run , the army , the screen , the high tone , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz . &quot;
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the sums .
I need the bu@@ zz . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then it stops the bu@@ zz .
&quot; revised , exagger@@ ated , ble@@ ached , burned . &quot;
the bu@@ ck stops .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth that their mom is a single working titles .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my mother will not be there , but you can write to my F@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; kitt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot;
there are the children of a tit@@ ans .
you are baby @-@ tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sums were stopped . &quot;
the sums of the motor was sil@@ enced .
I loved my work no more . the engine was out .
the sums did not come back .
my bu@@ ck was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , received weekends , no rep@@ ent@@ ance , nothing delegates , a Titan sleeps not , doesn &apos;t give up with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sums .
in me was silence .
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a pre @-@ show @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz I was .
&quot; so what do you do when what to do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l you off , sil@@ ly author tit@@ anium . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you are working to be a teacher , a painter , to be a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you simply love another and that gives you a bu@@ zz , if you know the bu@@ zz , if the bu@@ zz stops , who is it then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then I put my &quot; southern state @-@ wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; into a question .
&quot; I am on the way to the outside , late , and she says , &quot; Mama , mag@@ st you play ? &quot;
and I will no say NO to be conscious of two things :
&quot; first , I have to say yes to anything and secondly , they did not calling me . &quot;
it is no longer called &quot; fl@@ aws . &quot;
when is this happen ?
&quot; I temp@@ ted it when I am Titan and my bu@@ zz , and it all changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; Mama , mag@@ st you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special .
&quot; we play and her sisters come across , we lau@@ gh a lot and I read most dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ eliness and the absence of sum@@ ing , I can do nothing except to leave . &quot;
I am focused .
I am silent .
&quot; the land , which I managed , the marathon , the I walk , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky finger and mo@@ ist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax @-@ p@@ ens and the song in which it comes to Los@@ ing , or whatever the girl in &quot; Die Ic@@ eman &quot; . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so scar@@ cely that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and an energy supply comes in .
&quot; and not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums comes back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly here , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
not the bu@@ zz but a bu@@ zz .
&quot; and now I feel , as if I know a magical secret . &quot;
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the bu@@ zz , the working environment , the tit@@ anium @-@ consumption , this is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , when I tell you who I am , when I describe myself through broad@@ casts and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sums . &quot;
the bu@@ zz is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it is dependent upon joy .
the real sums depend on love .
&quot; the tot@@ ality is the current , which comes from living . &quot;
the real sums is self @-@ confidence and peace .
real sums ign@@ ores the pressure of history that has been completed exercises , the expectation and the print . &quot;
the real sums is simple and original .
&quot; real sums is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but maybe I whis@@ per@@ ed to God the wrong words because what God told me that I am a Titan . &quot;
it is simply love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , a lot more love . &quot;
&quot; once my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
I am making the firm rule that I can rid of any guilt as a work@@ a@@ holic .
&quot; it is law , I have no choice but I have no choice if I want to hear the sums . &quot;
&quot; wish it would be so easy . I am not good in games , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
play me not to play wis@@ ely as they work .
the truth is hur@@ ting ;
but I do not like it to play .
&quot; I &apos;m working still , because I love it . &quot;
I am rather at home in the workplace as a secret .
&quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , because what kind of a person is working rather than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we r@@ asen in the garden around , before and back , round and forth . &quot;
we make small dance parties ;
we sing and play Ball .
we sh@@ red soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel overwhel@@ m@@ ingly , ab@@ sent and confused . &quot;
I always write to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how one lives , and the sums of the universe met me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever heard about playing ?
you can also say it ! say they always then Yes when your child wants to play with you .
maybe you keep me for na@@ ï@@ ve for a dre@@ amy .
&quot; you have probably right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you also know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et @-@ show .
your child takes you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play at a maximum of 15 minutes with me , until they catch up , that they want to make something different . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bugs or kit@@ es replaces me .
&quot; and speak my teen@@ y @-@ daughter of all 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more needs it not . &quot;
&quot; everyone can catch 15 minutes at a piece , even in a bad mood ! &quot;
15 minutes on the play !
&quot; no mobile , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
the day is short : dinner that make children complete .
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my Well @-@ being , my world . it must not be the children . it is true to have the sums to feel a place for his soul peace . &quot;
it is not about playing with your own children . it is about pleasure .
about &quot; games &quot; in general .
allow yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and store it .
&quot; I am not perfect at this . I fail and I victories . friends meet , books read , enjoy the day -- &quot;
want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in education as I wanted to get more and more .
&quot; 15 minutes of play , why not just a 15 minutes away ? &quot;
what could be wrong ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the sums seem to come back when I do not work .
working not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens up and I find myself in my office again . I hear a well @-@ known melody , she fulfilled me and my soul . she moved me to new ideas . the sums spent it in full moves and love my work again . &quot;
I like the bu@@ zz but I do not love it .
I do not need it .
I am not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not I ... no more . &quot;
soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my bu@@ zz .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
&quot; the sums of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; it is wast@@ ed that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire still burn .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier are me and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clear is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz , the marathon , I run , the marathon , the clay walls , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the amount , the sums of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , be@@ aming , naked and new feeling of living in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sums , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I am author . I think of things I aw@@ aken you to life .
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; too much work and too more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am neuro@@ surgical .
as most of my colleagues have I to do with human trag@@ e@@ dies every day .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodily organs , has a very low capacity of self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , heavy disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I was sur@@ g@@ ically done neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions .
&quot; certainly they have heard from one of the most famous , the &quot; deep @-@ raising stimulation &quot; . &quot; this impl@@ anted one electric de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that neurological function has improved . &quot;
it really is an astonishing technology . she has improved the fate of patients with Par@@ kin@@ son who suffered severe cit@@ ations and severe pain .
Neuro@@ modul@@ ation however means not Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream Func@@ tional Neuro@@ surgery is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was leading super@@ visor and worked once a day and night in the emergency .
often I authorized patients with sk@@ ull @-@ bra@@ zen trau@@ ma .
they must imagine that at cran@@ ial @-@ she@@ et@@ ah the brain sh@@ aken and the sk@@ ull @-@ pressure cont@@ ends .
&quot; in order to save life , one has to dimin@@ ish the sk@@ ull . &quot;
to do this sometimes you have to remove a part of cotton brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing the bra@@ ised brain mass , we decided to analyze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; cells of a tissue , can grow , comparable to very small children which are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you need to find the proper diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to thri@@ ve them . &quot;
that is what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts by Jean @-@ François .
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked just like a regular cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you know still from the bi@@ ology lessons , that stem cells are un@@ ri@@ pe cells that can transform itself into every cell type of the body . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : regular stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die ; they are im@@ mor@@ tal .
but these cells betra@@ yed differently .
they slow and after a couple of weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , who looked like stem cells , but looked different . &quot;
&quot; we needed long , in order to understand where they came . &quot;
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells hot Dou@@ ble@@ ec@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our large @-@ brain cells .
you play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they remain given us ?
we do not know .
&quot; we believe it is taking part in the healing of the brain , as we find them close to brain violations . &quot;
but this is not so certain .
but one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
&quot; we are facing a potential nucle@@ us , that enables brain healing . &quot;
this is what we had to prove .
&quot; so , we decided to develop an experiment . &quot;
we wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non @-@ speaking area and then cultiv@@ ate the cells exactly as it was Jean @-@ François .
&quot; and they put them in a colour colour , to be able to follow them in the brain . &quot;
&quot; in the last step , we re@@ impl@@ ant them to the ent@@ om@@ est@@ al of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ spl@@ antation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spl@@ antation .
&quot; one of our first questions was : what happens when we impl@@ ant these cells into normal brain tissue , and what will happen if we re@@ impl@@ ant the same cells in a perpet@@ ual brain tissue ? &quot;
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario re@@ impl@@ ant we re@@ impl@@ ant the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely abandoned , they were taken back home . the room is already occupied , they will not be used there , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we have an injury to and impl@@ anted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they came up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
&quot; these are the cells , which were impl@@ anted . &quot;
&quot; evidence that they demonstrate are these little points . these are the cells we feel in vit@@ ro , in the culture . &quot;
here we could not stop .
help these cells also a ape to recover from a brain hur@@ ing ?
&quot; so , we trained monkeys with a manual approach . &quot;
they had to take food pell@@ ets from a tray .
they did so very well .
&quot; as they achieved a stable balance level , we have in the mot@@ ori@@ al Cor@@ tex the manual @-@ technology area . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move her hand anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen at people , they spont@@ aneously decided to take up to a certain degree , just as after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of sculp@@ tural doctr@@ ines . they are rec@@ u@@ perate to some degree , just like with the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we impl@@ anted its own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left side they see the monkeys , who saw itself spont@@ aneously . &quot;
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from before the injury .
it is not that precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , when we impl@@ anted the cells to the impl@@ anted : the same monkey , two months after the irrit@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that were very exciting results for us too .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze them and use them later .
we can use them in other new rop@@ ath@@ ological models for example at Par@@ kin@@ son .
but our dream is still to impl@@ ant them with people .
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the crowd , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need it . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in people . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one has to fill about two kil@@ ograms of paper@@ work and forms to run these kinds of studies . &quot;
BG : it is understandable that the brain is very delicate and so forth .
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a fast professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical studies . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes to arrive until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : it is difficult to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will it allow us to start the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to select the patients to perform and evaluate the treatments , whether it is useful to make these kinds of treatment . &quot;
then you need to apply this to a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study .
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment anyone .
BG : and that it is safe - of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to look at it as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality , but as inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to look at them as un@@ change@@ able contr@@ asts .
we believe that capitalism has inev@@ itably led to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great night@@ mare in Beijing have proven doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while policy remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy comes with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ ambig@@ uous that the democratic process of our country is un@@ ambig@@ uous that the democratic process of our country -- not likely to influence as@@ parag@@ ine programmes that have been implemented in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , or the Communist Party of China , or some of my un@@ il@@ able friends said to me that democracy would change if they would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for genuine democracy .
&quot; I ask you to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , who believe Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mist@@ aken , we could save ourselves from democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and natural democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies become common , our future gri@@ ds and our great , new technologies . &quot;
&quot; in the topic of wast@@ age , I want to point out to an interesting contradiction to the point of view our economies . &quot;
&quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; Z@@ will@@ s summit @-@ Par@@ adox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . they know and recognize him as the shoulder @-@ mountain , who casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all know the debt mountain , &quot;
&quot; however , only few recognize his twin . &quot;
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash that belongs to the pleas@@ ing as@@ parag@@ us and concert , which however may be anxi@@ ous to invest there where it would be productive and income , with which you need to carry away the Schul@@ den@@ berg and also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months have been invested in the US , England and the euro zone , have invested 3.4 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollars , including industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , streets , gas , equipment , and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 tri@@ llion US dollars sounds too much money , until one compar@@ es to the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ llion US dollars , which at the same time occurred in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to exp@@ el except the exchange rates and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit , which does not offset by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low overall economic demand that would not invest in an end @-@ loop the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of fear that proph@@ es@@ y of the or@@ ak@@ els could be true that his son would kill him if he grows , &quot;
un@@ rav@@ elled the circumstances leading to that o@@ edi@@ pus kill him .
this is my ha@@ ired with capitalism --
&quot; his extremely toler@@ ated kind . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and especially finance these technologies , &quot; Green &quot; Technologies , which are crucial for saving the Earth . &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
&quot; but before we continue , but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ? &quot;
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the social form in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy were of course too many from --
&quot; women , aliens , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to minim@@ ise the significance of ath@@ en@@ ical democracy due to these conclusions . &quot;
&quot; the bottom line of the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that she passed the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which grants them the right to political co@@ determination in matters of state power . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
&quot; as a candle , which lit very bright , it is also quickly hidden . &quot;
&quot; but our liberal @-@ liberal democr@@ acies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for ruling class . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy had only emerged when a full separation of politics and business is possible and the democratic process to put into politics , whereas economy - i.e. the world of corporations have been a democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; we have been in our present democr@@ acies since the time when this separation of politics and business began to mig@@ rate a her@@ edit@@ ary struggle between the two , the economy is gradually falling apart . &quot;
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not up to a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is because one can be in the government today , and still not in power , because the power of politics is ab@@ ander@@ ed in the economy and separated into areas . &quot;
I mentioned my ha@@ ired with capitalism .
&quot; when you think about it , it is in about as a flock of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es who are so sustainable the animals , from which they nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ zim@@ ung@@ ed that she was star@@ ve at the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy which the politics has so far @-@ fet@@ ched itself . the power of the corporations is growing , political goods will be de@@ valu@@ ated , inequality &apos;s economic demand is increasing and the managing director of the corporations are too fright@@ ened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful the capitalism cut the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the wast@@ age of human labor power and the welfare of humankind . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy again and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; control , apart from the exclusion of slaves , the women and the foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea for 100 years ago and it did not feel good .
&quot; the lesson from the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position as in the ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and wast@@ age . &quot;
but there is a solution : to create the working poor !
capitalism does it because it replaces Ni@@ ed@@ rig@@ orous employment through automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , the automation can become higher , the autom@@ akers are higher , and the social conflicts , deeper , as it is -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come . &quot;
&quot; so we have to re@@ design the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and we consider that we make a re@@ unified area more democratic , otherwise we can appear in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that may appear the film &quot; matrix &quot; like a documentary . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the question is not whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements that he has brought forth -- &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is dis@@ solved by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix &quot; , &quot; or through something that will serve the human society in &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; , &quot; or put their energy into the exploration of the Universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life . &quot;
I believe we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so what could it look like could it look like this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; , &quot; like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation I want to show you , in all short , some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies : please make a capital market in which you earn money , while you work and in which your capital follows you from a job to the next , and the company -- no matter what you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
then all income from capital and rede@@ em and the concept of wage labor is completely obsolete .
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but who do not work in them , and employees who work there . no exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and divisions , and ultimately not em@@ por@@ e twin summit . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please make sure that our national currencies have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 biggest Emer@@ ging Markets &#93; . &quot;
&quot; imagine that all world trade trading in this currency will be tr@@ aded -- we call them &quot; the Cos@@ mos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the commercial transfer of each country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that these funds invest in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investments are r@@ ar . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes was proposed at Br@@ ton Woods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time one was not the technical means to realise it .
&quot; today we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world , which I describe you is simultaneously liber@@ ally in which they preferred privileged people , and Marxist , because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the leg@@ ia of history , and key@@ n@@ esian , globally key@@ n@@ esi@@ an . &quot;
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine genuine democracy .
are we w@@ aking up in such a world
or are we going to become a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia spl@@ its ?
the answer depends on how we work politically together .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democr@@ atically . &quot;
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography himself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economics is ... do not doing this , the technological development create such a massive decline in general economic demand that Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers is called &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agnation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transfer of this crisis from one section of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing it , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democr@@ acies but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ ally democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is correct , then Marx is definitely relevant , &quot;
&quot; similarly to Hay@@ ek , this is why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also completely om@@ itted . &quot;
BG : actually and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t keep you think you don &apos;t think enough .
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday evening with dinner the speakers you have very clearly told what you think of the West &apos;s point of view . &quot;
want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the sem@@ bl@@ ance of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited the democracy limited to politics during the area , where most of them is , -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some ways , if I may say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; -- -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- which is an error , historically . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
&quot; he was particularly skep@@ tical , which affects the democratic development . &quot;
&quot; what one can watch in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; now , let China propose to do what the West did in the 19th century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listen@@ er are curious about your experiences as a finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I ex@@ hor@@ ted that it comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you have a look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very disappointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the eurozone , &quot;
&quot; to say goodbye to ourselves from self @-@ suff@@ iciency , and the continuous denial is that a massive overthrow between the eurozone was in@@ duced , and continues to massi@@ vely increase the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity to based on the Greek proposal -- the way , the first proposition that the denial was revealed -- &quot;
&quot; to do it properly . unfortunately , the powers have chosen within the eurozone , within the European group , continues to choose the denial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you are trying to get an economic system that is not viable , by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , it will perhaps be able to delay even a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see in advance ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change their structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- Ern@@ est ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister or any Minister , who , after 6 months in office , particularly in such tense situation , he claimed no mistakes , then that is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I made mistakes . &quot;
the greatest mistake had to be submitted to the extension for the extension of the school program at the end of February .
&quot; I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the money , to find a common solution . &quot;
but that was not .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government case , just because they did not want to deal with in@@ spec@@ tions , circul@@ ated through the euro zone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they have been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
none of the tro@@ ika credit@@ ors that imposed us this policy : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake .
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive moral of the conversations , you seem to be still quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone against comes from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; my greatest fear is that the eurozone is not out@@ lived . &quot;
&quot; for if they do not survive , the inter@@ connected tile forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be disast@@ rous for Europe but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the most powerful economy in the world .
&quot; if we set ourselves up the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will be also detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong on this point .
Yan@@ is . thank you so much for TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; by Roy Price , most have never heard , although it is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you . &quot;
it goes back to the decision that Roy met in just three years ago .
Roy Price is Chief Employ@@ ee at Amazon Studios .
the TV @-@ production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , sl@@ ender , has an in@@ scri@@ bed and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for doing the shows and the content , the shows and the content is produced . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought branch . &quot;
there are already so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t choose any one .
&quot; he has to find Shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , it has to be shows that are on the right at that corner . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the rating of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 , and the height shows how many shows this review get . &quot;
&quot; if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , the addi@@ ctive , where , after having looked at a season , your brain asks , &quot; where is there more from these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows how &quot; to@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; &quot; -- that should tell you what is happening at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry , to get into the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ go &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes up more thoughts on average output , the average television -- the shows , which are neither good nor bad they simply not . &quot;
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
&quot; the print is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is such a thing , therefore Roy Price is not going to risk . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needed self @-@ guaranteed success , so he will hold a contest . &quot;
&quot; he has many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects from an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can look at everyone free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon came out of things , one does not attack ? &quot;
millions of spect@@ ators look at these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they can be observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are observed by Roy and his team who will receive everything .
&quot; you record , when you start the show when you are blank@@ eting , the parts you jump over and check again . &quot;
&quot; you collect millions of data , in order to decide with these data , which show they should produce . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and from this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com about four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
you did this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that many of them can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this turn 7,@@ 4 is and Alpha House lan@@ ced at 7.5 -- thus something above average , but not just what matter and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time when another company has placed a top @-@ show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he does something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews that give them the shows , their course , what shows they like etc . &quot;
then they use this data to find out these little details about the spect@@ ators : what shows they like who producers and which actors .
&quot; when all those parts together they had a wagon and decided to do not a Sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has hit a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 review on this turn . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot;
of course is the question : what happened here ?
&quot; one has two very funny , data le@@ aded companies . &quot;
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what lies this ?
because the logic suggested somehow that this should work with everything .
&quot; if one gath@@ ers millions of data , for a decision that you meet , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
there are 200 years of statistics than back @-@ up .
one is optimized using very powerful computers .
&quot; what you can expect is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; when data analysis does not work , then this is something fright@@ ening because we live in a time in which we draw more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond TV . &quot;
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no . OK , this is even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope , that no one comes in this room ever in touch with this software . come in touch , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison in the United States and in order to dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dism@@ iss@@ al is made or not . &quot;
&quot; just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
&quot; this does not always produce the best results , however , that is not the case that a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data . &quot;
also the data sav@@ vy companies are even wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google was known that they were able to pre@@ di@@ ct data analysis of flu , st@@ lim@@ men art , predic@@ tions -- by data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a big message sensation . the success appeared in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked just every year by year , until it suddenly got no longer working , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data sav@@ our@@ est companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand things .
&quot; in spite of all these errors , data reflected in the decisions of life -- on the work floor , in the law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should prefer to make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or developing a drug . over the years I have detected some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be distributed .
&quot; you have to solve a complex problem each , you basically do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , let this problem be into its parts , so you can analyse the parts ; as a second , you put the parts together again to put a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do it several times , but there are always two things to take apart and put together . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help build a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assem@@ ble the parts again and then come to a decision .
&quot; for this , there is another tool and we all possess it all : our brain . &quot;
&quot; if there is something that the brain is good , there is parts and pieces again together , even though the information is incomplete , in order to get a good decision -- particularly when it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; that is why I think it was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because it used data and mind , where they are also going to go to the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , why they would not have been able to do so . however , the decision on how to put all these parts again , and make it a show like &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; which does not stand in the data . &quot;
Ted sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon but it did so in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they were created by TV ideas then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a Show . &quot;
&quot; it was a secure decision , because they could always say : &quot; this tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things go wrong as data begin to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool and to not forget that , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
before it was data this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it is ast@@ o@@ unding . for decisions using a Ja@@ ag or no matter , you only need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; exactly here at this moment . &quot;
I will leave it later with a demo @-@ demo .
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions in my life until I would have heard in the ball on the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know of course , if you have made the data available , you want to replace them through a much more cau@@ tious , such as data analysis in order to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; so perhaps the ball cl@@ ever@@ er and cl@@ ever@@ er and cl@@ ever@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that , despite the large amount of data still pays , decisions to meet , an expert in what you are doing , and risks . &quot;
&quot; for in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks beautiful .
