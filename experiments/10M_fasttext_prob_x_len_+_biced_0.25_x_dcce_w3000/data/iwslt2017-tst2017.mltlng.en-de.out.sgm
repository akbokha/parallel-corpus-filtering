<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They perhaps know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before anyone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he was spectacular, that the NSA heard illegally telephones from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is another chapter, which should leave a lasting impression."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in that he describes a catastrophic US intelligence surgery, where the CIA has literally undergone the idea of Iran for an atomic bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds like you can read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible history.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not fall at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">Almost 10 years the government has established against Risen and call it to call its incomparable sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, it became a symbol for the pattern of government, whistleblowers and punches journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the first constitutional agreement, the media have the right to publish their secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right when media do not get this information, and if they can not protect the identity of the mud that they can inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government came with Risen, he did something that many brave reporter already did before him: he refused, and said that he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, he lived with the risk of going into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the process, something extraordinary."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, though for years, though she would have been indispensable for their case, the demands of the government were dropped off."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time electronic monitoring the reporter and sources can be less hidden.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of fail and bringing crampons to the statements, that also could do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, his phone spelling justifiable,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit card, and even travel documents with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to be Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA, whistleblowers and risome source, to judge."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama spoke with his attachment, to protect whistleblowers. however, the judiciary has more condemns more than all U.S. governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government did a lot from their work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblowers to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we are pressing the press work, which is to be protected by the first constitutional account because the government has more and more possibilities, all spy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology is allowed to deal with the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and they may do that from the moment they contact, instead of in retrofit, in the witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"there are communication software that has not yet been written as Risen his book, and it is much safer than regular e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source-source system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed from the website of the website, which was originally developed by us, and is today from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"mail an e-mail, go to a news page, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can send documents uploaded or send information, just as with each usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server that is only the respective message agency access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so, the government cannot receive more information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">"SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole, to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world develop new spy technologies that endanger us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is an obligation to ensure that not only technology, such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to reconcile misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the nearest whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"the more than abnormalities in the care of soldiers humd knows and wish to report crowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm for the contaminated water of Flint suggests. or a pilgrimstreet insider, which warnings us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover the crimes, but to protect our lives of all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on 3 April 2016 the biggest Datenleck of History has been published.] [the" Panama Papers "has been hidden in the" "Panama Papers", "[what does that mean?] [we were made of news about a Leck of 11 million documents of the law firm in Panama law such as Fonseca.]"</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mosbag Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up your setup? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works, as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has come back.</seg>
<seg id="48">"also, there are reports that a foe of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad Briefing-Assad in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is arguing that a trace of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russia President Vladimir Putin, through a close friend of children's ages, a famous cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people out there, and others that are nervous over the next release, and the next uncovered documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agency grilled or a John-Grisham.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems crying out of you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we address this?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is, if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all of their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in all over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and devout their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing it for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seems highly confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always ask myself like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who behind these prayers."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for compiling and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what matters is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because there have been no prominent Americans now that occurred in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"well, it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"however, by the principle, after which these tax havens work, has Moso Fonseca less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we would have a plot from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some US states you need less information to provide less information to create a company than to get a librarian note."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of transparency in the US has allowed its employees to take away from school districts.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has not allowed to remove any particular amount of investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here with Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this is in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that work?</seg>
<seg id="73">"so, we sent a covered broker into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan."</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigators gave himself a African minister, who wanted to bring the suspicious money into the U.S. to buy a house, yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we really shocked it really, that all up to an attorney at our disposal proposals made, how to transfered his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all precautions. none of these lawyers participated as clients, and of course, nobody was handed over to money, but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer that has broadened our covert proposals.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single leader of leaders in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, by the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and in order to cope with this, we need to change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to aggravate this kind of behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound quite a bit weird as if we could not do anything against it, as if nothing ever had ever changed, as if there is always the rich and most powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a born, I really see that some things have begun to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years we have seen far-off towards more transparency which concerns the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">"the topic found political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU captured in central registers at the national level, who truly lies behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have launched a draft resolution in both Parliament, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means being used to ensure greater transparency in the US and global."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people, which are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headquartered."</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need executives in the economy which are open and say," "transparency is not good for business." ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and campaigning for it to end through laws this type of transparency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally finish the indifference which now makes these kinds of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I was kidnapped almost once and in the trunk of a red Mazet."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design study, I did a backpack."</seg>
<seg id="98">"a guy in the red Mazda remained, and watched my stuff."</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artwork.</seg>
<seg id="100">"he was alone in the city, and just made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards, he would go to the peaccorps."</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me the way he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where do you get there tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I do not know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought:" "Oh, man!"</seg>
<seg id="106">What am I now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I now have to offer a sleeping place?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I did not come to know him! he said, he would go to peace corps, but I don't know if he really is planning. I will not kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazland!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself saying: 'I have a air mattress. you can sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="112">"one voice in my head said," "h, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was in bed, I went up to the ceiling and thought:" Oh man! what got me built-in? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild estrangement in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I was given such a fear that I got out of the bed, at the tenth to the door, and my sleeping room door lock."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not insane.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the artwork, which he had bought from me is hanging in his classroom. he is now a teacher."</seg>
<seg id="120">It was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">"maybe people who were sold to me in childhood as stranger, actually friends, who were only waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"to accommodate people on my airmattress, it was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's take a time jump, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I'm out of a job, almost plough, my roommate is moving and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I think creativity can create it, fear in fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky:" Brian, I have overwhelmed how we can earn something about it. our apartment comes to a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast "[AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">"they found it great, and we too."</seg>
<seg id="132">"I am sure, our cheese ham brusquette tastes completely different, because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them through the whole city. when we met our last guest and the door came into the castle, rigid Brian and I call."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Brarczyk, joined us as developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented our Investors:" we want to create a website on which people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms, their doors, whose doors are closing when a visit is gone. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the internet they can then invite to invite you to overnight in them.</seg>
<seg id="140">It will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">"indeed, they are not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still very consolation, would invest in a shop, the stranger allowed to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all learned as children that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem you get to the things that you can good. we were able to digest.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we had learned that design much more is than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to diznt objects, but now we wanted to create confidence by an immense trust between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a cheduling to which degree confidence we aspires.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your unsolicited mobile phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this quietly excursion of panic, which you now sense -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door first."</seg>
<seg id="158">"because the only thing, which is even more personal than your mobile phone is your home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your text, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel like to unlock the phone's cell phone in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So most guests feel when they will stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company cannot exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only once so, who does actually have Al Gores mobile phone now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you preach on Twitter that he is capable of President of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phone now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbour was presented only once with his name: if he had told whence he comes, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you could have 150 Beessments that all say: "he can really cling very well and guess wrys!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you would have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-designed feedback system strengthens the confidence decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for the people to dissolve negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"ultimately, we decided to wait until both host and guest had made their judgments before we placed them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how they are similar to old and home."</seg>
<seg id="178">Somewhat surprising we trust the people most who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social occurrence.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting is it when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case through evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if one has less than three divisions, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but, one has more than ten, changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation is in common.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can thus help us overcome some of our deep-rooted predilections.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we experienced that confidence depends on how much one can expect from them."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"when you tell too little things, like" "Hi!", "you are not getting any answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells you how for example:" "I have problems with my mother --" "-- the request is also rather not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" Tolle "works in your apartment! I do with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to produce this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">"we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct quantity of text, and we also give tips on what subjects to write something."</seg>
<seg id="193">"our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help, overcome our prejudices against strangers."</seg>
<seg id="194">"what we had not reckoned, was the vast amount of people who were more than ready to submit these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people use our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">Firstly: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">"second, the tireless work of our team."</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a need that was not covered beforehand."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is running very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything is running smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have allowed unauthorised parties or apartments devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">"I stood at the front line, if trust was broken."</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it already hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that you hear in the voice of caller, and will always be our greatest motivation to improve ourselves further."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, by the 123 million sold accommodations only a fraction of a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other right.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if confidence works, it can be a miracle."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host was driving him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who tend to tend to carry out their heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real protective angels who save a life, even though they don't know at all."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, if you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they do not want you feel lonely, they bring books over."</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without the extra-nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay is running."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled for the first time about this term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is simply called" "Rental industry", "the cause will not do justice."</seg>
<seg id="228">"Share Economy describes a trade, the human relationship promises."</seg>
<seg id="229">People create a part of themselves openly and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel nowadays, this is to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but to do so less authentically."</seg>
<seg id="231">"but what would be, if travelling a rich buffet of local impressions would be?"</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place you visit, a group there and announcing it to show you thoroughly and show one with a bar pentine neighborhoods where one has never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to shape the apartments from the bottom to another?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would assume the idea of a common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships, instead of loneliness and depreciation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in the South East of Seoul, this project has already been started. many parking spaces that belong to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">"were now offered by inhabitants. students who were looking for a bond,"</seg>
<seg id="241">Were conveyed to people whose children were moved out. they were started Incubator programs.</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. about our platform alone, at night 785 000 people in 191 countries will be a host or even a host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be so crazy about how we were joined.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not have invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also previously mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were some similar sites to us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"aside from luck and Timing, we realize that one can find the right design with the components of the trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome provertured prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it amazement;</seg>
<seg id="251">Straight to overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think every time when a red Mazda goes to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us if there was this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, a brains underwent, a terrorist attack?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in safety at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">"so, the media represent people who look as like me."</seg>
<seg id="264">One study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably the people do not speak with their drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee-player -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am both introverted;</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegs-Fitness-Fanatikerin, "</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not as Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I met the decision to see me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as Muslim. I chose Hijab, my headgear."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist girlfriends was horrified: "why suppressed you yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the Lustige was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, and in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only adopted passive the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I did with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, thought, unquestionable, and believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow surrender that deepened with any reading of the correlation.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I realise myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"had you ever feel that somebody you perceive, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels like.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as engineering."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later I had, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had at an end, looked at the screen and saw the word" Eiler "." "</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, airplanes in buildings, people spill from the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should we do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I joined the television channel and heard:..." Muslim terrorists "..."... "in the name of Islam..."... "... jihad...,..."... "bombs Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it was not only attacked my country, but in the Nu turned me the actions by others from a civil society into a suspicious."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to go through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start building study."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember as I went away -- as we were speaking -- as deeply it went into my seat, and I feared the first time as Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved this night to our apartment in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then heard, saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said:" be vigilant, "" Seid waking, "" bubbling in well illuminated areas "," Versammmelt not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then we became Friday in the week -- the day when Muslims gather to bed.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" goes not on this first Friday, the mosque could be a destination. "</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw this extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims and from people who thought for Muslims, and smashing down."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not right.</seg>
<seg id="314">"because people who have attacked this land, attacked our land."</seg>
<seg id="315">I postponed the anger of people on terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to have to be explained to the constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing to ask questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">They are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"today, we can actually say people:" there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as of a tumour in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor be removed as a whole and a benign tumour only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are like all other Americans, no tumour in the body of the US, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, Ersthelfer and Olympionions."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make it safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"it may be a few parking spaces, but not stop terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to people's other faith tolerant, and to show greater citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and, as a head of the police in the Washington, DC recently told, people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are opened in their cellar or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the radicalization process, one finds that it's online. as a First the person is cut off from their church, that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behavior and their ideology is a traitor, or of faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we need to stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still asserted that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS founded their brutality with the Quran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"Muslims, as mother, as a person, I believe we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"yet, we would add to her imagination, if you acknowledge them as representatives of 1,6 billion believers."</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux Klan by Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"both groups asserted their ideology prevailing in their" "Holy Book". ""</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when you cast a look at it, it does not drive what she is blown in her" Holy Scripture. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that makes them read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she imagined to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radicals religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the reverse. every clergy with whom she had spoken, she brought her to silence and said her that her wrath, her sense of injustice in the world, she would only bring in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing, and something that had given mind to her mind, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists that gave her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam made the connection to God and their church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of blame for her humility he showed her constructive paths for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she stopped to join the IS before."</seg>
<seg id="354">It was an insight as to the Islamophobia me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does normal Americans affect?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect every other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How is the 24-hour consumption of fear every day for our democracy - to our thought of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear we happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we accept a authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study indicates: if one discourses the news, in which negative reports have been reported on Muslims, they have more military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just a academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"when you look, when the mood against Muslims moved to the above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two choices.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem-terror, as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to undermine the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well-informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is an early warmark.</seg>
<seg id="367">Perhaps we feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear treats us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">"in the assignment of collectivism, it is not just about to explain themselves to themselves."</seg>

<seg id="378">Let's go back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or stayed safely at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we find it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave our children, one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to take the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's quarter, we went to the Mosque, with high pressure on the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, my shoes went out, went to prayer all, and what I saw, left me to hold."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"Imam made an announcement, thanked, and called our guests, because half the congregated were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, who had come, not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>

<seg id="407">"what started as a platform for crafting, will be shortly before, to become a billion store."</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drummers. possible, the research institutes are made worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air condition to penetrated into our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France built a six meter high tower from 1 500 brick and a few years ago they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by joining the aircraft, reach high speed and speeding up to the narrowest room."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-sufficient structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads to deal with turmoil and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">"today, we would like to show you some of our new projects."</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the Possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system of autonom, it needs to know collectively, where in the room the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localised technology from Verity Studios, a offsprings of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each plane has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest level e. B." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter, "</seg>
<seg id="422">"one airplane, that is trying to strike two flies with a cap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in advance flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most starters, it can swing, and has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">However there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">"a restriction of tailgate is that they are sensitive to turmoil, such as windsurfing."</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the airplane doesn't matter at which position the optimum position can be regained and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often introduce basic abstract questions which preach to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the small amount of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons why you want to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known around as machines with a thousand movable parts that join forces to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Several decades ago trained pilot-controlled aircraft were able to fly only two movable parts: a propeller and a rear.</seg>
<seg id="435">"long ago, we discovered that flies with just one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monopolist, the mechanically simplest TV, and it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flank, hinges and rump, no further actuator or inspectors, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, happens in the inside very much so that it can fly stable and move in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tailgate. to bring it to the compartment, I need to have it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood of throw it right when all watch, is low, so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when the moon is an exercise in gene, this machine is here, the omiscopter with its eight propellants, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What do you do with all this fluence?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"thereby, he receives the indecent ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"move in the room in all directions, no matter what direction it is filmed or even as it rotating."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers from eight propellors."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some things are visible in models, the rest is learned directly from flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see this too.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two-propeller engines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turn in clockwise clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when they build them, they act like a high-performance Quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something wrong goes wrong -- an engine or propeller falls, the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine even if limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that by taking a half of airplanes.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration is examined synthetic turmours.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, co-ordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">"we participated in the Micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one disc bread -- and provide them with localised technology and algorithms."</seg>
<seg id="461">"every unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no limit."</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you will motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine since it does not want to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">It is of course difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types as us lies the reward in the development and creation.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a memory, how wonderful and enchanted our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever gifts to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential it is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>

<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago there was a multi-cell life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then, the earth has brought a lot: corals, fish, plants, saurs, people and -- God stand at us -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"for about 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous - Rai Weiss from MIT, KIP Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational-waves, which are created by collious black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most were they regarded for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people realized it as a crazy genies, so that the US National Science Foundation funded their idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the Detector LIGO: the laser-interferometer-gravitational-waves atory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"during the follow-up time, the precision of LIGO could considerably increase the amount of recognition."</seg>
<seg id="483">That's why you now call him Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 LIGO was started for a last test run by some minor, stubborn problems. "</seg>

<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life are emotional as this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the departure from my todill father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"basically, they were the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"all that which I had worked, is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicists on MIT. he studied for 23 years of gravitational waves of black holes and their through observatories such as LIGO measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crow in the texture of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"on the transiting of the wave, the space and its whole content is stretched in one direction and turned into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"to illustrate, faculty in Kursen to relativly theory often have a correct literal dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that vitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, each of us was stretched on the waves of the waves and overshout. the stretching of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1st Darum, one told the LIGO staff for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre laser Detector, and this is absurd, this length would have to be measured less than a thousand of the radius of an atomic kernels. that's grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity.</seg>
<seg id="502">"described KIP Thorne, a co-founder of LIGOs, the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are extensive. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are emerging, and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott willingly, LIGO is more than an eye than an eye. "</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial hair, the size of your mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="508">"that is quite handy. because in this way, you can make an image or a map of things by taking the light of the coming light around you."</seg>
<seg id="509">In the notes is that different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"it is therefore very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that will give you particularly much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child around.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we laugh at certain properties like tape and height, rhythm and volume to close the history behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now she is talking Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"yes, Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot produce simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by watching changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least lie for LIGO the chiseled frequencies in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so, when we convert the wave-patterns in locks, we can hear the All literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">The engraving to listen can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes that my colleague Scott has very long been busy.</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-speed holes, circulates simple: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two body very fast and it sounds the same circle with an additional tonic. this sounds like this: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement and shaped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14. September 2015 -- a date, which at least I will never forget - heard LIGO follower: [Surrendernoise] Jemand, who knows what he must hear, recognises this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold sun mass, which is about as fast as the sticks of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: considering what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the dichtest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve each hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know that because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">There is the permanent meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO paves a completely new way to investigate the Alls as it had never before possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this road we can listen to the universe and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can -- practical or basically -- not visible.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a Supernova, for example. I would like to know why masculine-stars in super-novae will explode."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes do occur however at the core, which is hidden behind thousand kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through since these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it would be more transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it as the Big Bang is covered by his own offspring."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using the gravitational-waves, it should be possible to back up to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and the most importantly: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen before and of which we have no idea of what we can only discover, by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, LIGO found immediately at the first step things we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: ME: the type of stars, the black holes are observing as LIGO they are observed are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are the hovering for our archaeological work. "</seg>
<seg id="546">"LIGO offers us a completely different angle of view of the events in space, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we went out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors, the noise and paves of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>

<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreaming with us.</seg>

<seg id="619">The totals is action and activity. the totals is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums up is light and air.</seg>

<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buck was broken.</seg>

<seg id="665">"I know some may think," "Heul you off, silly author titanium."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you are working to be a teacher, a painter, to be a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you simply love another and that gives you a buzz, if you know the buzz, if the buzz stops, who is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then I put my "southern state-waitress" into a question.</seg>

<seg id="677">"I tempted it when I am Titan and my buzz, and it all changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mama, magst you play? "</seg>

<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly here, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzz but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">"and now I feel, as if I know a magical secret."</seg>

<seg id="707">The buzz is not a force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent upon joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depend on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">"the totality is the current, which comes from living."</seg>

<seg id="796">I am neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues have I to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, has a very low capacity of self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, heavy disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was surgically done neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"certainly they have heard from one of the most famous, the" deep-raising stimulation "." this implanted one electric de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that neurological function has improved. "</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an astonishing technology. she has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson who suffered severe citations and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however means not Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream Functional Neurosurgery is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leading supervisor and worked once a day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I authorized patients with skull-brazen trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that at cranial-sheetah the brain shaken and the skull-pressure contends.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, one has to diminish the skull."</seg>
<seg id="816">To do this sometimes you have to remove a part of cotton brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing the braised brain mass, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"cells of a tissue, can grow, comparable to very small children which are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you need to find the proper diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to thrive them."</seg>
<seg id="823">That is what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts by Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked just like a regular cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you know still from the biology lessons, that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform itself into every cell type of the body."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: regular stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells betrayed differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slow and after a couple of weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, who looked like stem cells, but looked different."</seg>
<seg id="837">"we needed long, in order to understand where they came."</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells hot Doubleectin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our large-brain cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they remain given us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe it is taking part in the healing of the brain, as we find them close to brain violations."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">"we are facing a potential nucleus, that enables brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">This is what we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">"so, we decided to develop an experiment."</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non-speaking area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it was Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">"and they put them in a colour colour, to be able to follow them in the brain."</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we reimplant them to the entomestal of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">"one of our first questions was: what happens when we implant these cells into normal brain tissue, and what will happen if we reimplant the same cells in a perpetual brain tissue?"</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario reimplant we reimplant the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely abandoned, they were taken back home. the room is already occupied, they will not be used there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we have an injury to and implanted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they came up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">"these are the cells, which were implanted."</seg>
<seg id="862">"evidence that they demonstrate are these little points. these are the cells we feel in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help these cells also a ape to recover from a brain huring?</seg>
<seg id="865">"so, we trained monkeys with a manual approach."</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did so very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"as they achieved a stable balance level, we have in the motorial Cortex the manual-technology area."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move her hand anymore."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen at people, they spontaneously decided to take up to a certain degree, just as after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of sculptural doctrines. they are recuperate to some degree, just like with the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left side they see the monkeys, who saw itself spontaneously."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from before the injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not that precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, when we implanted the cells to the implanted: the same monkey, two months after the irritation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were very exciting results for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other new ropathological models for example at Parkinson.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them with people.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that is wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the crowd, perhaps even the majority, think:" I know someone who need it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in people."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one has to fill about two kilograms of paperwork and forms to run these kinds of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: it is understandable that the brain is very delicate and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a fast professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical studies. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes to arrive until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to start the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to select the patients to perform and evaluate the treatments, whether it is useful to make these kinds of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you need to apply this to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe - of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it. "</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to look at it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality, but as inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as unchangeable contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism has inevitably led to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great nightmare in Beijing have proven doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while policy remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy comes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unambiguous that the democratic process of our country is unambiguous that the democratic process of our country -- not likely to influence asparagine programmes that have been implemented in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew, or the Communist Party of China, or some of my unilable friends said to me that democracy would change if they would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for genuine democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, who believe Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistaken, we could save ourselves from democracy, but that we need a truthful and natural democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies become common, our future grids and our great, new technologies."</seg>
<seg id="914">"in the topic of wastage, I want to point out to an interesting contradiction to the point of view our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">"I call it the" "Zwills summit-Paradox." ""</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. they know and recognize him as the shoulder-mountain, who casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all know the debt mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">"however, only few recognize his twin."</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the pleasing asparagus and concert, which however may be anxious to invest there where it would be productive and income, with which you need to carry away the Schuldenberg and also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months have been invested in the US, England and the euro zone, have invested 3.4 Billions US dollars, including industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, streets, gas, equipment, and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion US dollars sounds too much money, until one compares to the 5,1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time occurred in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to expel except the exchange rates and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and unproductive capital form the twin summit, which does not offset by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of 25-54 year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe, and consequently a low overall economic demand that would not invest in an end-loop the pessimism of fear that prophesy of the orakels could be true that his son would kill him if he grows,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Unravelled the circumstances leading to that oedipus kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my haired with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his extremely tolerated kind. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and especially finance these technologies," Green "Technologies, which are crucial for saving the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">"but before we continue, but before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?"</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy were of course too many from --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, aliens, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to minimise the significance of athenical democracy due to these conclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the bottom line of the athenian democracy was and is that she passed the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which grants them the right to political codetermination in matters of state power."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"as a candle, which lit very bright, it is also quickly hidden."</seg>
<seg id="937">"but our liberal-liberal democracies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for ruling class."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy had only emerged when a full separation of politics and business is possible and the democratic process to put into politics, whereas economy - i.e. the world of corporations have been a democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"we have been in our present democracies since the time when this separation of politics and business began to migrate a hereditary struggle between the two, the economy is gradually falling apart."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not up to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because one can be in the government today, and still not in power, because the power of politics is abandered in the economy and separated into areas."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my haired with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"when you think about it, it is in about as a flock of carnivores who are so sustainable the animals, from which they nourished, decimzimunged that she was starve at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy which the politics has so far-fetched itself. the power of the corporations is growing, political goods will be devaluated, inequality's economic demand is increasing and the managing director of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful the capitalism cut the" Demos "[the people] from democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the wastage of human labor power and the welfare of humankind."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy again and it would be better if the" Demos "control, apart from the exclusion of slaves, the women and the foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea for 100 years ago and it did not feel good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in the ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and wastage."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to create the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it because it replaces Niedrigorous employment through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, the automation can become higher, the automakers are higher, and the social conflicts, deeper, as it is -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to redesign the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and we consider that we make a reunified area more democratic, otherwise we can appear in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy that may appear the film" matrix "like a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"therefore, the question is not whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements that he has brought forth --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is dissolved by a dystopia, similar to the" matrix "," or through something that will serve the human society in "" Star Trek "," or put their energy into the exploration of the Universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks the meaning of life. "</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what could it look like could it look like this" star Trek "," like utopia instead of the "matrix" -similar dystopia? "</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation I want to show you, in all short, some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies: please make a capital market in which you earn money, while you work and in which your capital follows you from a job to the next, and the company -- no matter what you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and redeem and the concept of wage labor is completely obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies, but who do not work in them, and employees who work there. no exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and divisions, and ultimately not empore twin summit."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please make sure that our national currencies have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 biggest Emerging Markets]."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that all world trade trading in this currency will be traded -- we call them" the Cosmos "," in units of "cosmos" "-- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the commercial transfer of each country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that these funds invest in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investments are rar."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes was proposed at Brton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time one was not the technical means to realise it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today we have them, especially against the background of a reunified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world, which I describe you is simultaneously liberally in which they preferred privileged people, and Marxist, because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the legia of history, and keynesian, globally keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine genuine democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Are we waking up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or are we going to become a "matrix" - similar dystopia splits?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we work politically together.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better democratically."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography himself as a libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economics is... do not doing this, the technological development create such a massive decline in general economic demand that Larry Summers is called" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"through the transfer of this crisis from one section of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing it, it will not only destabilize our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberally democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is correct, then Marx is definitely relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"similarly to Hayek, this is why I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am also completely omitted."</seg>

<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein that said. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday evening with dinner the speakers you have very clearly told what you think of the West's point of view."</seg>
<seg id="990">Want to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the semblance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited the democracy limited to politics during the area, where most of them is, -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some ways, if I may say this provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"-- -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- which is an error, historically."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">"he was particularly skeptical, which affects the democratic development."</seg>
<seg id="998">"what one can watch in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"now, let China propose to do what the West did in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listener are curious about your experiences as a finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I exhorted that it comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you have a look back six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"to say goodbye to ourselves from self-sufficiency, and the continuous denial is that a massive overthrow between the eurozone was induced, and continues to massively increase the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity to based on the Greek proposal -- the way, the first proposition that the denial was revealed --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"to do it properly. unfortunately, the powers have chosen within the eurozone, within the European group, continues to choose the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>

<seg id="1011">"if you are trying to get an economic system that is not viable, by political will and authoritarianism in life, it will perhaps be able to delay even a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive."</seg>

<seg id="1038">"by Roy Price, most have never heard, although it is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">It goes back to the decision that Roy met in just three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is Chief Employee at Amazon Studios.</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slender, has an inscribed and describes himself on Twitter as" movies, TV, Technology, Tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for doing the shows and the content, the shows and the content is produced."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought branch."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy can't choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find Shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, it has to be shows that are on the right at that corner."</seg>
<seg id="1049">"this curve is the rating of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10, and the height shows how many shows this review get."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"are shows like" Breaking Bad "," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows, the addictive, where, after having looked at a season, your brain asks, "where is there more from these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows how" toddlers and Tiaras "" -- that should tell you what is happening at this end of the curve. "</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry, to get into the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to undergo" Toddlers and Tiaras "." "</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes up more thoughts on average output, the average television -- the shows, which are neither good nor bad they simply not."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the print is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is such a thing, therefore Roy Price is not going to risk."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needed self-guaranteed success, so he will hold a contest."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he has many ideas for TV shows and selects from an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can look at everyone free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon came out of things, one does not attack?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they can be observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who will receive everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you record, when you start the show when you are blanketing, the parts you jump over and check again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">"you collect millions of data, in order to decide with these data, which show they should produce."</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process these and from this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom about four Republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">You did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that many of them can remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this turn 7,4 is and Alpha House lanced at 7.5 -- thus something above average, but not just what matter and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time when another company has placed a top-show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he does something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of holding a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data about the Netflix audience, so the reviews that give them the shows, their course, what shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the spectators: what shows they like who producers and which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when all those parts together they had a wagon and decided to do not a Sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards ". Netflix has hit a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 review on this turn. so exactly where they wanted to go. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course is the question: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very funny, data leaded companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What lies this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic suggested somehow that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if one gathers millions of data, for a decision that you meet, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">There are 200 years of statistics than back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">One is optimized using very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"what you can expect is good TV, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"when data analysis does not work, then this is something frightening because we live in a time in which we draw more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond TV."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no. OK, this is even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope, that no one comes in this room ever in touch with this software. come in touch, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison in the United States and in order to dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is made or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">"this does not always produce the best results, however, that is not the case that a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data."</seg>
<seg id="1098">Also the data savvy companies are even wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google was known that they were able to predict data analysis of flu, stlimmen art, predictions -- by data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a big message sensation. the success appeared in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked just every year by year, until it suddenly got no longer working,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data savourest companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand things.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"in spite of all these errors, data reflected in the decisions of life -- on the work floor, in the law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should prefer to make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or developing a drug. over the years I have detected some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be distributed.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"you have to solve a complex problem each, you basically do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, let this problem be into its parts, so you can analyse the parts; as a second, you put the parts together again to put a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do it several times, but there are always two things to take apart and put together."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help build a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">"for this, there is another tool and we all possess it all: our brain."</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something that the brain is good, there is parts and pieces again together, even though the information is incomplete, in order to get a good decision -- particularly when it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"that is why I think it was Netflix so successful because it used data and mind, where they are also going to go to the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, why they would not have been able to do so. however, the decision on how to put all these parts again, and make it a show like" "House of Cards" "which does not stand in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon but it did so in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first when they were created by TV ideas then as they chose" Alpha House "as a Show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a secure decision, because they could always say:" this tell us the data. "</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things go wrong as data begin to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool and to not forget that, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before it was data this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 Ball ". it is astounding. for decisions using a Jaag or no matter, you only need to shake the ball to get an answer." most likely "" exactly here at this moment. "</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will leave it later with a demo-demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have made some decisions in my life until I would have heard in the ball on the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know of course, if you have made the data available, you want to replace them through a much more cautious, such as data analysis in order to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"so perhaps the ball cleverer and cleverer and cleverer. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that, despite the large amount of data still pays, decisions to meet, an expert in what you are doing, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"for in the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
