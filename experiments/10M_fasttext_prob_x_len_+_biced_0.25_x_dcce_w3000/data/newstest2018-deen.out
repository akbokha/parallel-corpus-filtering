&quot; Munich 1856 : four cards , which change your view of the city &quot;
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt where young people are to meet today .
a tr@@ ays which is now du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn .
small@@ y@@ den@@ ers manage the one @-@ sti@@ ff reason for farmers .
the oldest official map of Mu@@ en@@ chen promotes exciting stories to days .
it is annoying when land@@ cards are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; this knows everyone who had already had to rain , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i instead of a changing roads led to a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bav@@ arian At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bayern the State government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but is therefore very close . &quot;
especially when you compare them with current online cards .
&quot; then it will be clear that cities and municipalities are in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Merk@@ ur , since the 19th century . &quot;
the digital Bav@@ arian @-@ Atlas is a mak@@ es@@ try which can be seen as such .
&quot; in the large picture postcard , for cities and communities were more detailed maps , so @-@ called m@@ posi@@ tional blades . &quot;
these were written according to the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Ver@@ tical Auth@@ orities between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and de@@ els the first Ver@@ messung Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during World War II .
Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ o@@ graphical reception of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops served with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 , it was the present neighbours who created the idea of a surface @-@ face @-@ face . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max I@@ V. Joseph drove the project ahead , the &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Cri@@ mes Bureau . &quot;
the fact sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all the other on the website of the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Landes@@ bibliothek zu .
the comparison of fruits / Today is in the example of the provincial capital at an impressive .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ s@@ end@@ ling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was attended 21 years after the map , so 1877 , as a Mün@@ ch@@ ner district . &quot;
today there is a sub@@ s@@ end@@ ling in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses sub@@ s@@ end@@ ons focus on 1856 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the rebellion of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : at the Hin@@ o@@ oma appears a small dis@@ advant@@ aged card with do@@ zens of lines and figures : hand@@ writing numbered Fl@@ ur@@ pieces from the so called &quot; &quot; Big recording &quot; &quot; from which the property tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; little par@@ ous cells do not occupy no farmers more , but small @-@ scale of the plant &quot; &quot; Land of Sun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is situated north of Lower Eng@@ s@@ end@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 Schau@@ platz of the Okto@@ ber@@ fes@@ ts , was actually a meadow - and no concrete . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of the psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
in the area of the present district A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen is not only reads in the district of today &apos;s A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only the road name &quot; at Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the cap &quot; View of the surface &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren .
&quot; yes , here on the Au@@ er@@ fel@@ d@@ strasse we have once used people with ins@@ anity . &quot;
&quot; there , 18@@ 58 / 59 was created the Mün@@ ch@@ ner circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since 1872 , Dr. Bernhard from Gu@@ dden , he led the institution - that Psy@@ chiat@@ rist was brought to the death of King Ludwi@@ gs II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the Ank@@ ola of so called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; he is also prohibited to use the staff to apply force against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has engaged in an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients there was first place , later to 500 places were expanded . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity no longer has been made - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ east have been one of the largest psy@@ chi@@ atri@@ ate in Germany since 2006 . &quot;
on the area of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ old now young people meet in Mün@@ ch@@ ner Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order war@@ b the building complex in 1920 and turned him to a youth home with appr@@ enti@@ ces .
&quot; west is the football field of the T@@ SV Munich East , East residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , one set up the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; - in ar@@ quit@@ ecture to the original prison of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &apos;s origin , which had been destroyed during the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; the Marien@@ platz was around 1856 as the &quot; &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the merch@@ ant name was called &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change was brought into the heart of the Second World War even in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies in December 1944 many holes in the city centre .
it was great until today - in the Marien@@ hof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a guide from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Marien@@ hof where these days work and on April 5th , 2017 the sp@@ ade for the second S railway line . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared to the a@@ erial view of today - and the hole at the Marien@@ hof . &quot;
civil @-@ rights groups published travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National association for the promotion of colour @-@ colored has issued a warning for colored men who are travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i because of the discrimin@@ atory policy and the rac@@ ist attacks of the State .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the federal state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which should come into force until 28 August 2017 , while travelling through the state requires special attention and utmost caution , since a series of frag@@ ment , rac@@ en@@ based pre@@ tension can occur in recent times throughout the state and here is noted , &quot; it is stated in the statement of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently approved law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder to complain , as well as the perpet@@ rators of the state , the dis@@ proportionate to minorities , promp@@ ted the group to give the travel warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said . &quot;
&quot; they have infring@@ ements of civil rights , people happen . &quot;
&quot; they are raised because of their skin color , they are mer@@ ged or killed , &quot; said the president of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ansas City Star . &quot;
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency , which we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot;
it is the first such warning that has issued the organisation for a state in the US .
&quot; the Group quoted as rac@@ ist accus@@ ations against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders , under question@@ able circumstances beginning of the year , after the state had no gas@@ oline at the beginning of the year , and was captured by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i in cust@@ ody without a crime . &quot;
the Council also pointed out a recent report by Mis@@ sour@@ i &apos;s office in which it is shown that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and to inform their families , friends and employees about what might happen at Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; says Chapel . &quot;
people have to be prepared if there are merchants or let the relatives know that they are travelling through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded in 2015 100 times in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the Assy@@ rian reporting , the state as regards the number of such injury to the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
&quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it harder to complain a company because of housing or employment @-@ discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ ES ) published before the United States adopted for Texas and Arizona , after the United States adopted immigration legislation to compens@@ ate for people because of immigration violations , which in view of AC@@ LU for further r@@ attle . &quot;
&quot; travel documents are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but at the last time stakeholders have implemented this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
ham@@ per@@ ation project is elementary
the Wei@@ mar Dec@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will be continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Par@@ ag@@ or@@ ted Peter Weiss and Kor@@ du@@ la K@@ ovac have got a picture on the ground .
&quot; at the right @-@ grab@@ ber of the family Schwen@@ de@@ mann , representatives of the her@@ edit@@ ary CD@@ U local village together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann granted first insights into his business , in which he operated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest farming , 40 milk and also housed in five apartments holiday guests . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Black @-@ milk &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative mark@@ eter way for the milk of his cows , so pi@@ v@@ ot . &quot;
on the table of the holiday guests only comes registr@@ ar .
&quot; since he is also called BL@@ H@@ V @-@ Chairman of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach , he called the wheat project as an &quot; spontaneous . &quot; &quot;
I cannot manage such steep areas in such steep areas .
the green @-@ area care for a lot of work done with the motor sense .
&quot; we have been working here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 he took over the el@@ eventh operation and applied these without chemical @-@ based pesti@@ cides and fer@@ til@@ is@@ ers , even if there is no growth . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; the Comm@@ une has recognized the importance of the wheat project , and is pleased with the Leader . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , the farmers would need to be supported . &quot;
&quot; one hope that the for@@ estation of the plots could be moved out for quite a while . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the biggest treasure that we have , are the people working in agriculture and make thoughts about how they bring their business further , &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot;
farmers are often involved in criticism
&quot; a total of 25 plots of eleven plots were fenced in the year 2013 , a total of 25 plots . &quot;
&quot; thus , the area of entertainment amounts to 40 hectares , which will not be hosted for at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; from the total cost of 71 500 Euro was funded half of the Leader , a quarter carried out the municipality of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; thus , they fell to the farmers 12 6@@ 10 euro , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 km of wheat . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Kor@@ du@@ la K@@ ovac stressed : &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and countryside , it does not go . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter Weiss stand firm , &quot; Here are the best foods produced here . &quot;
the landsc@@ ap@@ ing unit ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg makes it possible to support the govern@@ ors of the wheat prot@@ esters .
the goal is the disclosure of the black race .
prerequ@@ is@@ ites is the presence of one of the L@@ PR signed conveying .
&quot; in addition , the enclosed area may not be slim ( Hang@@ over over 35 per cent ) and has to be threatened by the performance . &quot;
&quot; at the end of 2018 , at the request of eight participants with 24 pitches who would like to build up to 16 kilometers of fence . &quot;
&quot; the area of entertainment equivalent to 35 hectares , which are equivalent to over 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking the Statue of Liberty
the safest sign of a regime transfer is it when they begin to att@@ acking the statues .
&quot; the Americans are estim@@ ating these as much as every other , therefore the care@@ full fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos Place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key @-@ ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , knew certainly what he did , when he had a symbolic ax@@ e in a h@@ it@@ ous dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the proposals of the president to the dr@@ astic restriction on the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of bo@@ ots and Liberty @-@ Im@@ it@@ ators had gotten him over if he had done it .
&quot; but he laid hold of their significance , and in particular the importance that you were attributed to when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after completion of the monument , his base was added . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta , &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that lit the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem which you relate , which later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is knowled@@ geable properly , but as he form@@ ulate it , it is not really about story . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the sho@@ cking words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poorest people , your poor , / your over@@ ly anxi@@ ous masses , who wish to breathe freely , / the el@@ ending waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ end waste &quot; was better to see in our screens .
Miller dedicated not to liter@@ ary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s US .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who continued to place their words after her death on the base - did very well that they accomplished a high @-@ political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American republi@@ can@@ ism by portr@@ aying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus modified this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ ps and a devast@@ ating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and exactly like Lazarus the importance of the statue changed , the people of the right wing wanted to go back for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great cry as a Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Bap@@ tist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argu@@ ed in 2010 , that the Statue of Liberty is nobody inv@@ ade , but rather an early n@@ o@@ conserv@@ atives , that bring the American flame in the um@@ re@@ ed world : &quot; &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot;
it is said to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
F@@ ack@@ el is not supposed to en@@ ligh@@ ten the way to the United States .
rather unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something .
the significance of the statue is entirely and even a question of awareness of the perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus consisted in them , as they see from the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refu@@ ge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp ever wish to recognise .
&quot; your tor@@ ch is not supposed to en@@ ligh@@ ten the way , but the hat@@ red , who is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championships 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ int@@ ed members of the team from Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of a time when only two car@@ r@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain .
&quot; the power director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member sch@@ ot@@ tish cont@@ ingent will be a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish Ath@@ l@@ eten was selected for London 2017 that starts on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland &quot; &quot; something special develops &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish Ath@@ l@@ ete think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy at the corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is it is absolutely brilliant .
&quot; several of the Scottish Ath@@ l@@ eten are medals @-@ candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which was voted against Sir MO Far@@ ah at the 5,000 m route , whereas E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle was elected by the crew to the team cap@@ tains . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is rather modest .
&quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter whether they were sh@@ ot@@ tish or wherever they live or exercising , went out of space and were very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ ie was natural , of course , were magnificent . &quot;
&quot; the British silver medal winner who won the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dles in her fifth World Championships , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 car@@ r@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s greatest number of athletes at the world championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the mu@@ ir @-@ run@@ ners Mu@@ ir lead the way to five British and two European records last year . &quot;
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m of rounds . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , which runs 1,500 m , is another sc@@ otte that should be observed after a great season , which should be observed in the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle reminded of her first World Championships as the only other car@@ rot in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the team &apos;s capit@@ ols says that they are &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; &quot; on the fact that many of its comp@@ atri@@ ots do not only belong to the team but in some cases also with the medals and the finals . &quot;
&quot; the special about the team &apos;s chapters , lies in that it was chosen by the other members of the team so it &apos;s anyway a great honor to know , but to know that my team mates voted for me and have chosen it to something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I am very proud of all the vill@@ i who belong to the team .
it shows only how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who wish to rise to Po@@ dium . &quot;
what my speech as captain concerns ?
&quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Championship .
&quot; so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it , that we are back at the Olympi@@ ast@@ adi@@ on . &quot;
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there .
blocking cri@@ tic on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot carry the killing of elect@@ ors .
the father of our country knew something from poor media .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last long before the newspapers swal@@ lowed him because of everything from the internal policy to its political principles . &quot;
he dro@@ wned upon cri@@ tique safe .
but he did not put his critics to silence .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led as sheep to battles . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to governor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work on it to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinions on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union def@@ endant him this week at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the stand of the governor sent the law@@ suit as fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online comment was full of a bac@@ kl@@ ash with &apos; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; many people said . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; this is a Republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is surprisingly popular . &quot;
he has the second highest agreement of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of its state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very skill@@ fully to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his ha@@ ar@@ less head to chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the block@@ ade of persons who come to the side of the Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum that is officially designated as officially and by employees working with public taxes - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post defended , Amel@@ ia , Amel@@ ia Ch@@ asse the acts of the Govern@@ ors and argu@@ ed that the block@@ ade of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it is too easy to use the image of glasses or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ ted people that reson@@ ate online via the wh@@ ip .
the post spoke to some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are just real people who speak to their chosen leaders , a teacher , a business ent@@ repr@@ en@@ eur and a pastor . &quot;
they all told that their comments were respectful , thought@@ ful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the parish priest the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to the testi@@ fied Catholic faith .
&quot; attorney at Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ t but she asked to ab@@ ort . &quot;
&quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current news , &quot; wrote them in the commentary area of the news . &quot;
&quot; I do not appreciate this idea , if a number of people is standing on the same subject , it will be dis@@ regarded by some more than a so @-@ called collective action rather than a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the employees of the Govern@@ ors were referred to as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; , &quot; others would probably call &quot; &quot; caring &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook @-@ era makes it easy to make a message , by simply blocked a critics or deleted a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is a lot of cleaner than in previous time when you have done the same that staff were sent to collect newspapers with critical wire artic@@ els , and to burn or drop prot@@ esters and to silence them . &quot;
but this is just what happened digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official that critic@@ ises this to Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is acc@@ ents by Twitter @-@ users who were blocked by his Twitter @-@ Fe@@ ed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question occurred last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County last the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US @-@ District writer James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they called a voters of their Facebook @-@ page . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky was Gover@@ nor Matt Mo@@ in ( R ) also obtained a visit from the AC@@ LU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
&quot; at the moment Washington &apos;s time , the time of affordable POR@@ TOS had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lies between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous stamp visits to his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington was an anonymous tro@@ ll .
&quot; the people , the pseu@@ don@@ y@@ me like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers , the Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions which have criti@@ ci@@ zed his position on the contract of am@@ ity , trade and shipping with the United Kingdom , overwhel@@ med his position , according to historical documents that were collected from the Online pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not put it to silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreements and dis@@ agreements belong to the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raf@@ fer@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raf@@ fer@@ ty is hoping for the next three days at home comfort as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an organized the 25th issue of Scottish Senior Open .
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who killed next year next year at the Ar@@ cher@@ field left until the end of the end , before he lost the new venue , and fun@@ tioned as a tournament amb@@ assador in the name of the club @-@ founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved with this event his glory , &quot; said Raf@@ fer@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great state . &quot;
Jerry made a great job when he set this place .
he is an eag@@ erly champi@@ ons of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the English E@@ ales will be happy to defend a championship for the first time , even though in his 32 @-@ year career he won the European Tour as well as at the European Challenge tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels particularly true , &quot; said the players located in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open as it was last year , after I had won them out of the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories from the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win the last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came back to his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year to the European Senior Tour , returns to action at home . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since Aber@@ de@@ en Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to make it well , but you can also feel this additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I am glad how this is gone .
&quot; with the trio on the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Bro@@ adh@@ ur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ iger . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six vill@@ i in the field , the others are Andrew Fri@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; entrance is free , the parking lot cost £ 5 per car with a car and £ 10 per car with two or more in@@ mates . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
fewer lung cancer through Pas@@ sug@@ ary
over the past two decades there are fewer and fewer people died due to passi@@ vity in lung cancer .
the scientists reached the university hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ ke ) in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates per year , 167 of the lung cancer is due to passive tobacco smoke , &quot; said Pro@@ ko B@@ echer . &quot;

home@@ work prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; reasonably priced &quot; , &quot; thus the head of the Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the field of hous@@ ties , the location is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground much dis@@ erg@@ s , which is not noticed in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which always ob@@ struc@@ ted the construction work , represents a big problem for the Bau@@ tr@@ up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of the drivers in front of red lights and hi@@ kers is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is locked and only the line buses be eligible for passage .

poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ dina Deg@@ ei the dinner coo@@ ks it does not use a stove .
it is used even rarely a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai controller , lies in the un@@ quiet in@@ don@@ esian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually den@@ otes a sweet potato - local as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour the fo@@ al bu@@ b is taken with eag@@ erly , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed . &quot;
Deg@@ ei sits on the lo@@ ism - she has no furniture - where they also carry out their daily work , e.g. garments with dec@@ ep@@ tive water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bu@@ cket in a homeless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband you were not assigned fields .
Poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late to work can be dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily ; and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; no one sees it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village sh@@ let them around , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life of the highlands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony that was founded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when just 1.0@@ 26 elders is going to vote in front of the occupation forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing motion , which stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch rule , turned out quickly towards the government of Jak@@ arta that maintains its control over the region , and ex@@ cludes foreign journalists or legal action . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province officially increased in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent majority of the Pap@@ ua @-@ Neu@@ gu@@ ine@@ as . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Gu@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive away .
there are no public transport .
&quot; the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bamboo , and from cor@@ rug@@ ated boxes , which were converted by R@@ ost in various yellow @-@ brown notes . &quot;
&quot; very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , because journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;

there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says Deg@@ ei and points to her animated , handmade tur@@ ban , her dark Shirt and their bright rock . &quot;
&quot; earlier we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indon@@ esian Province where 28 % of men live under the poverty line and some of the worst inf@@ op@@ al and liter@@ acy rates in Asia have .
but it is also Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles away from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has built a total of 3,@@ 1 billion US dollars of gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has obtained a value of estimated 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; however , these rich@@ es are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , which are sure of Indon@@ esian military has retained a sti@@ cky presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that fre@@ ep@@ ort local military relatives and entities between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ ers demands for greater autonomy - these golden G@@ ans and are dealt with mer@@ ci@@ ples .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 papers have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed since 1969 by the Indon@@ esian military , tor@@ tured and incar@@ cer@@ ated since 1969 . &quot;
mass@@ ages in Pap@@ u@@ as anc@@ es@@ hoch@@ land in the 1970 @-@ he years have been referred to in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission to the genocide .
only in the region held the Indon@@ esian police in the past year more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; we adverti@@ sers everything in a report from the arch@@ dioc@@ ese Brisbane from the year 2016 , in the reports of atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as un@@ law@@ suits and torture - rape and electro@@ attacks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as each week goes through , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the screws have been reinforced , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources can bring about an influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % christ@@ lich , but the demo@@ graphic development is changing because Muslim economic migrants are from the most popul@@ ous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ anese Bar@@ ung @-@ Kant@@ inen sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with oil . &quot;
local people fight to stay here .
&quot; the migrants have started to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua for sale , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ native , who moved to the province capital Gu@@ ap@@ ura to work . &quot;
&quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama , the women &#93; from Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the crowds and as Jo@@ kov@@ i , spoke during his election in 2014 to address the ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; the former car@@ penter held 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken , because we have voted for Jo@@ kow@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jo@@ kov@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October a deep point . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children out there and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers jour@@ ne@@ yed by the darkness . &quot;
the ro@@ cking children said to them that they should turn off their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took a cl@@ ash to her tone , and later came back with four soldiers , so the pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , j@@ agu@@ ed and sm@@ ote the group with their hon@@ ors , told victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; one child , the 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard pressed that he fell into the coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set to fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered together on a football ground in front of the local police station and the military power center to request justice . &quot;
they carried out cerem@@ onial hunting ar@@ ches and resulted in the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in the circle - and a bird @-@ con@@ ges@@ tion - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some prot@@ esters began to s@@ cour@@ ge stones on police and military post .
&quot; when the mood was heated , soldiers had sent an command over an internal Fun@@ k : &quot; if the masses had more than three times resistance , they shoot them dead , &quot; said it in an official document of T@@ IME , which has not been released by the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ pping danger and called for tranquility and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening in the mood to listen .
&quot; when I turned myself , I suddenly turned into my lin@@ kes hand@@ wr@@ ist , &quot; he said T@@ IME on the veranda of his colour@@ ful Wood@@ block . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame knows still not who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the people gathered together . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were folded , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the indigenous man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , the witness of the shooting was . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and studied his body to make sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ ane , who bears as many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only a name , the T@@ IME in dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I have k@@ issed him .
&quot; the cheer@@ leader of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Repor@@ ting , that his officers wanted to protect their station just &quot; &quot; because they are attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
the news about the k@@ ill@@ ings had only come to Jak@@ arta on the following day .
&quot; three weeks had Jo@@ kov@@ i in Vill@@ ap@@ ura a passionate talk , where he vo@@ iced the sympath@@ ies of the families of the victims and sul@@ ph@@ or , to address the historical mis@@ de@@ es in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I would like that this case will be resolved right away , so that in the future it is no longer going to happen , &quot; he said . &quot;
safety Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he set up an extra @-@ court mechanism for the establishment of historical human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses started almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries have occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 @-@ s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ he years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; he said . &quot;
then he made a retreat when he spoke to Jak@@ arta on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with T@@ IME and said he didn &apos;t set any plans in Pap@@ ua to set a complaint mechanism .
&quot; instead &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the Wir@@ anto , which has been charged the UN because of &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua had already been attached , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were opposing such claims with gri@@ m un@@ believers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear later .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have fear , to be arrested by the military , have fear that shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us reiter@@ ated that the people of Pan@@ i@@ ai fear have to discuss the incident .
&quot; he says that he was be@@ aten from the military after he helped , four of the victims . &quot;
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought for me &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
the shooting have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring a mind @-@ free man to hospital , died a person and 17 others were wounded , among them also children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , the dro@@ wned , when he caught in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital . &quot;
to@@ urs@@ ed vill@@ agers prot@@ ested from the site office of the company .
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers saw stones on officers , who re@@ acted by warning . &quot;
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the crowd and killed a killed .
&quot; we were so panic , we are afraid that there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Badi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witness as the in@@ coming here is quick , so the T@@ IME . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to retreat the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ rest for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tri@@ bes@@ men , mon@@ i , Dan@@ i , and Dam@@ al , who live in the green highlands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many were joined the &quot; &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , which claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by placing spor@@ adi@@ cal attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indon@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the Top @-@ O@@ PM guide come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years , under the pre@@ text of protecting the national sovereignty . &quot;
some are never diving again .
&quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai , as &quot; a tragic , forgotten village . &quot; &quot;
poverty strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the bit of rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is for locals too expensive . &quot;
bread is just as apart range .
people here are building everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and vegetables and vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women working with four or five fields of sweet@@ ener .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces Not@@ a tasted only 10,000 Indon@@ esian R@@ up@@ iah ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the indigenous Pap@@ ua and the new immigrants grew , since the opening of new routes to the airport Nab@@ ire have arrived in greater numbers . &quot;
&quot; few jobs that exist in the region , usually go to the better trained and af@@ flu@@ ous migrants . &quot;
Pap@@ ua does rarely have the capital or the necessary ability to manage their own company more competitive .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Chief Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions of reporting international media remain tense . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Basi@@ ll Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to the films . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the dep@@ uty Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jo@@ kow@@ is campaigns were raising the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development , not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new haz@@ ards to foreign journalists who try to report from Indon@@ esian provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua to report : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of the Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in March , six paci@@ f@@ fish states - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ onen Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to examine the &quot; various and widely spread injury &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the in@@ don@@ esian State Department of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r dism@@ issed the accus@@ ations of the group , and said journalists in Jak@@ arta , &quot; &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights accidents . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human right @-@ amb@@ assador K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , bru@@ ises its silence and elaborate it &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that wants to participate in the meeting , but anonymous . &quot;
&quot; in Indonesia , Indonesia has a further presidential election , but Pap@@ ua can say that they probably will not be able to vote for Jo@@ kov@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jo@@ kow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai , the chair of the tri@@ bal . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jo@@ kov@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people know , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a peasant army , in arm@@ our and health services . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people says , like other papers , their vote for Jo@@ kov@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; that he has to return . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ uss@@ sion led a last symbolic act of the dum@@ pl@@ ings : the cor@@ k of a sacrifice was buried in a complex opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they may know that they may never cope with justice , but at least they do not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a laid head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scrapers in Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest towers of the world in Dubai , his conc@@ er@@ ecting and forced hundreds of inhabitants , dating to the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ stor@@ ey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire , which is defeated in just two years through the sky@@ scr@@ aper which is by chance the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evac@@ u@@ ated , injury were not reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we are temp@@ ted with the temp@@ tation and writing of the people . &quot;
&quot; we ran the stairs down , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50@@ th floor to the bottom , &quot; told a resident , who took his name as George , Reu@@ ters , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 0@@ 0.00 @-@ GMT ) the fire cleared and the building cool .
&quot; the government said , they work on the provision of accommodations for those affected . &quot;
&quot; the incident can answer questions about the safety of materials , which are used in outer areas of sky@@ scrapers throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage caused by the cl@@ adding , the outdoor fair@@ ing for decoration or isolation . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said the police , they believe that the system of plates to isolation and fair@@ ing of the London Gren@@ fell tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a Bran@@ des , where about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : farther Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis courts ( IT@@ F ) is with his big Davis Cup cou@@ ps at the AG@@ M .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the Davis Cup single was supported for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single only on two winn@@ ings , Hau@@ ch@@ thin did not support from the required two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; although this is often very long , but too much appreciated five @-@ set classics remain the traditional style . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only slightly mis@@ directed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our membership not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the review .
&quot; not only for the vote was after many contradictions already before the proposal , the finals had to be carried out in a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively small details , the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be announced in the first round of the host law in the first round . &quot;
&quot; to reduce costs for the Organiz@@ er , the requirements are facilit@@ ated in terms of training courses etc . and the players will have to pass before the Davis Cup less official media dates . &quot;
more than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers brings advanced objects into a plane , finds a survey out &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by air passengers discovered that over 20 percent conscious or un@@ aware objects passed to the check@@ points of the US Transportation Security Administration past tastes , including at least 6 percent , who entered the aircraft , while they acci@@ dentally with@@ ered kni@@ ves or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent asser@@ ted , they could have been del@@ ayed that they were mist@@ aken with fire@@ arms , am@@ muni@@ tion or explosive material . &quot;
&quot; the survey with more than 1,000 people - the provided by a Jet @-@ charter service , the STR@@ ATOS Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , carried out - also indicated that younger travellers are more adher@@ ents to the rules . &quot;
&quot; from the respon@@ dents , the en@@ vy that they kno@@ w@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned from the T@@ SA , were 19,@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were . &quot;
&quot; the most common articles , which were inten@@ sely marked by T@@ SA agents , were food and liqui@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 percent gave to that kno@@ w@@ ingly have borne objects with clin@@ ch by the safety check , whereas 2,@@ 2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they visi@@ bly embarrass@@ ed drugs on the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said , I ask people across the country to find out how many will have acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ ged dirt resulting from the airport security and how many things have done . &quot;
&quot; it is not a surprise that people , most of sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers - wis@@ ely or unk@@ now@@ ingly - due to security wearing those who were most often flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company pointed out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often uncertain about what liqui@@ ds they are allowed to take or how much of it .
so it is not a surprise that the largest amount of items posted by the T@@ SA coll@@ ap@@ ed liqui@@ ds .
&quot; a time long thought the people , the T@@ SA could look at books as sm@@ ug@@ gling ware . &quot;
&quot; liqui@@ ds are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : tens of tens of Tes@@ la clients cancel order
&quot; elec@@ tro @-@ thous@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k gives you a huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so far he has under@@ scored that some of the customers have already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
&quot; in addition to the always tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ant numbers to revenue growth and a giant sales aim , Tes@@ la @-@ Chief El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time tell a different , less gl@@ itter@@ ing number : the cancell@@ ations made with the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; over the past months Mus@@ k had already applied for the new car with more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery has just started . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k was one : of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 63.@@ 000 have already returned again . &quot;
critics always had pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservation .
&quot; in a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) . &quot;
&quot; at present , 45@@ 5.000 of such un@@ binding reservations are available , Mus@@ k Mus@@ k in a phone conference with an@@ al@@ ysts . &quot;
&quot; however , that cancellation of up to twelve per cent of all orders could become a problem , the Tes@@ la Chef does not believe . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge in ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production site . &quot;
&quot; last year Tes@@ la 8@@ 4,000 vehicles delivered in the past year . &quot;
&quot; 2018 - all models should be assembled - 500,000 , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , at present every day 1800 reservations are made up . &quot;
&quot; who ordered &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; , &quot; is allowed to reck@@ on in the second half of 2018 with delivery - if Tes@@ la creates it , its brand @-@ new , never in practice tested with maximum under@@ breaks with maximum relief . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , it comes to larger delays , then the non @-@ binding nature of the reservations could become the problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company can not prevent the company dis@@ satisfied customers , in Sch@@ aren . &quot;
EPA Chef P@@ ru@@ itt moves on the rules of the Obama &apos;s rules to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after having been lam@@ ented by 15 countries , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the leader of the environmental protection authorities , re@@ pres@@ sive his former decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g air pollution . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be the needs of the state environmental protection authorities , more than previous administr@@ ations . &quot;
he did not mention the law@@ suit had been collected against his previous job in a federal state of occupation .
&quot; it is about a deadline , which was held on 1 October for states to adhere to the standards of 2015 for down zone . &quot;
&quot; in June that he postpon@@ ed adher@@ ence to a year to give his authority more time to study the plan , to inter@@ fere along with local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; suffered , who was prior to his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp Public lawyer by O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , a long time ago was a reliable opponent of the environmental protection regulations . &quot;
&quot; since his arrival in Washington P@@ ru@@ ff@@ led repeatedly to block , blocking or delay the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden turn from Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ denti@@ al Roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a federal head office in Washington has decided that the EPA has passed its authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas enterprises to monitor and reduce the acquisition of Meth@@ ane . &quot;
&quot; in one on Wednesday night &apos;s opinion , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his turn @-@ off at o@@ zone standards is simply the willingness of EPA to co @-@ operation with the states through the complex process of timely implementation of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to comply with the deadlines for carrying out and then to be charged by activ@@ ating groups and others , and in an agreement made the appointment for the accompl@@ ishment , &quot; said the EPA approved more than a dozen time in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take limits seriously . &quot;
we also accept the law and authority that gives us serious .
&quot; nevertheless , the EPA asked that P@@ ru@@ itt at some point will take advantage of his &quot; authority for the delay and any other legally available perfection , &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; based on solid policy and the best available information is based . &quot;
the republi@@ cans in the Congress will push for a more disturbing factor in the o@@ zone .
&quot; a bill in the last month of authorized legislation , the implementation of the rules of 2015 will delay at least eight years . &quot;
the measure was not yet in the Senate .
&quot; the New York &apos;s general state @-@ owned company Eric Blan@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the states that had promised the EPA in this week , said the group intended to maintain legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of EPA - after our peti@@ tions - is an important gain for health and security of these 6.6 million New York and those over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by smo@@ g , who flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; said C@@ utting . &quot;
&quot; new York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Io@@ wa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; oz@@ on arises when cont@@ amin@@ ants made of cars , power plants , oil minist@@ ries , chemical environments , and other sources in the atmosphere of sunlight . &quot;
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious surgical problems with sensitive groups of people and contribute each year to thousands of premature death cases .
representatives of the public health system and the environ@@ ment@@ alist che@@ ered about p@@ ending course change .
&quot; it is disturbing , how much pressure it takes to get this rational step from those responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need to keep fighting against the ideological Crus@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to change to environmental poll@@ uting and their special interests . &quot;
Tum@@ lings celeb@@ rates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche is invited to the old Cem@@ et@@ ery on Sunday , July 16th , at 16.@@ 30 o to a Seren@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth charity Seren@@ ade can be ench@@ anted by this for@@ ce@@ ful place .
rescue and maintaining the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens .
Walter Mart@@ ini empha@@ sizes : &quot; it is a unique village of village . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle has been mentioned for the first time in Wür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg@@ ische Ur@@ batch . &quot; Graf Hermann of Sul@@ z &quot; &quot; the mountain with an old parish church at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the wording of the certificate , in the tum@@ our mountain apart from the church rec@@ tory there was also a delightful farm , which belonged to the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age law and not the other way around . &quot;
so there were people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , was beside the sub @-@ village and the Ober@@ dorf , which today is still visible in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ bl@@ ingen , the &quot; Berg &quot; of the third , the splendid settlements of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around the year 1600 under@@ pin these historical conditions .
the pat@@ ron@@ age right was created from the early medieval peculi@@ arity right .
&quot; one Lord who built a church he worked and worked with a pastor , he continued to remain independent of this church , and could also destroy this peculi@@ ar church . &quot;
associated with this was the right to use a pastor or to propose a new priest .
three alt@@ ars were there in the church and two bells on the tower .
the biggest of the two zer@@ mer@@ st on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created Glo@@ cke was then abandoned for the first time 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later during World War II in 1942 . &quot;
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window disc@@ s were suspended and the bells were stolen .
the roof was un@@ tight .
17@@ 96 lag@@ ged French troops in the vicinity of the church .
they came out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened in 18@@ 09 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery was also used as the last resting place for the dead made from listening .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the aid church broke off .
only the church tower let you stand .
in the New Year @-@ year 18@@ 34 m@@ alt@@ ed a storm the church tower and the half cr@@ ashes one .
&quot; to prevent an un@@ happiness , the tower was abandoned . &quot;
only the existing tur@@ k@@ eg@@ l@@ wer@@ g still remained as a witness to the 750 year old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ lon@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em of the &quot; &quot; sheep @-@ reti@@ re &quot; &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn , the Hil@@ arius @-@ system . &quot;
&quot; as an organis@@ er , the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gen invite the Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the Old Cem@@ et@@ ery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
it is designed by the com@@ mander of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with the contributions of Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Matt@@ eis .
local law Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing word .
the program starts at 16.@@ 30 .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 .
to end the Seren@@ ade takes place a trunk in front of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; the organis@@ ers present the fantastic view . &quot;
the Seren@@ ade takes place only in the case of dry weather .
&quot; the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hil@@ arius installation , which is of importance to tum@@ ors and listening @-@ speaking regions . &quot;
&quot; the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to home care , such as Seren@@ ade Organ@@ ator Walter Mart@@ ini . &quot;
we want to check the approval of Win@@ vices
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim watches itself &quot; does not see any legal requirement for the construction , and therefore has turned towards the land Council . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim w@@ ad@@ ored &quot; , &quot; has promp@@ ted Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ unters ( CD@@ U ) to resume its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
&quot; the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ets , we cannot have granted any wind turbines , as at the time in Vier@@ sen , only at the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal a wind force of concentration . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are fundamentally possible , at the same time the concentration of concentration , however , causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the remaining city area . &quot;
such zones are meant to avoid &quot; savings &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city Vier@@ sen had a few days before , a second wind turbine trade zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , which however had not approved the District government Düsseldorf , because of a mis@@ error . &quot;
&quot; through the lack of planning @-@ legal requirement , the shared author@@ is@@ ations is still un@@ law@@ ful and therefore also backward , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current status of things : the City Council has once again decided the wind @-@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ est@@ mer N@@ ut , with the approval of the District government . &quot;
&quot; yield : &quot; &quot; this is where the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines , was not legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of invitation .
&quot; the corresponding writing has been noted since last week in the district Vier@@ sen , &quot; stated a speaker . &quot;
the circle is on the occasion of checking the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with a view to ongoing procedures at the Board of Directors , the Circle on Thursday not wanted to refer to the reason@@ ing of the association &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; NEW Re , an affiliate in NEW , is planning to build a surface of four to 200 meters high winds . &quot;
&quot; last year the company , in which the city is quad@@ rup@@ tible , pos@@ sessions with the owner of about 65 hectares of great money . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to approximately one @-@ fifth of the power @-@ demand of all quad@@ ru@@ ple households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vi@@ ers@@ ens City Council gave green light to buy three wind turbines in the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as an involvement in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor cr@@ ashing together : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident has occurred on Friday afternoon at 10 am on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and the @-@ bird ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman was fatal .
two other people were readily in@@ ju@@ red .
the national road remained locked over hours .
&quot; according to police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her car in the accompanying car with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as an esc@@ ort the L 333 in direction to B@@ bird . &quot;
city and dealer plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bad Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ er and people from the region are to be discovered in September the shopping area in the city center .
commercial association and city administration want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the residents to the city stroll into the city center .
&quot; as the president of the industrial association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; will raise the customers to sensi@@ tise , which offers the own city away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; thus , a market with regional vendors , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their apprentic@@ eship . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops in the city centre will invite you to &quot; Mid@@ ni@@ ts &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the promotion does not only focus on residents of the city and the closer region .
&quot; in preparation were commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bag , who point on the Ak@@ tions @-@ weekend , so Christian König . &quot;
&quot; city management and commercial association , cooperate with the industrial and trade chamber . &quot;
&quot; for this , the commercial association and the town are entering another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive City . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; Ak@@ tiv @-@ Day &quot; &quot; to the Brun@@ nen@@ fest with sal@@ es@@ cing Sunday , conversations with all the trad@@ es@@ men and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
&quot; even attractive offers on Saturday and parking on parking charges on this day are part of the concept . &quot;
&quot; in addition , customer potential should be new or re@@ marked . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center with shopping from the view .
&quot; at the end , everyone would need to contribute to the inner city - to land@@ lords , the farms throughout the city and associations . &quot;
&quot; it came to overcome with a network the Le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy , which made some ambig@@ u@@ ously , had made king in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , Chairman of the I@@ HK Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen shared with that participate in the nation@@ wide third &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; day , for the first time , five Thür@@ inger cities participate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za these are Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ lighter ode . &quot;
&quot; the day was meant for the esteem of local trading and make its importance for the common good of our cities more strongly , &quot; &quot; I have . &quot;
the action among pen@@ holders of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen could be influenced by its purchasing behaviour .
two dead and several in@@ die according to explosion at US school
&quot; during construction work , there was a gas @-@ investment in the school building . &quot;
new people have been in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; at an acceler@@ ation in the U.S. city Minneapolis , two people were killed and nine others have been wounded , some of them heavy . &quot;
according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade was on Wednesday ( local time ) still a last in critical state .
a man died when a part of a school building was rus@@ hed at the blast .
a first mixed lot was later also dead in the dead .
&quot; among the dead , it was the staff of the school . &quot;
&quot; as an un@@ fortunate , the authorities believed in a gas guide . &quot;
at the holiday season only few people stopped in the building of the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy .
Tru@@ mp sat by telephone tran@@ scription by phone call Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the Grenz@@ wall .
tran@@ scription by phone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and Le@@ aders from Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January called Tru@@ mp in a phone with the Mexican presidency En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to to quit , say publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. president accused him , because he had ref@@ ra@@ ined the Wall publicly . according to him , he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t say the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp started its presidential campaign to build a wall to the southern border of the United States , and to leave Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and un@@ covered a tense exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , take over , &quot; &quot; m@@ ies &quot; , &quot; and &quot; du@@ mm &quot; be , &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ ies &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; , &quot; after having proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp be@@ ended the call , having said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ Mass@@ aker : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury was driven by a group of spect@@ ators in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ ank to the Ford @-@ Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men joined with guns to block its way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous strip - took a long train at its cig@@ ar and looked after the wind@@ shield .
inside smo@@ ked the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; bro@@ ods the man . &quot;
&quot; get it from the car ! &quot;
Schre@@ ie cr@@ ashes the silence , as a young black man from the passenger seat was distor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; luckily , this horrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is only a selection . &quot;
&quot; but if a loop around the neck by &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; were thrown out almost all in the audience a real sig@@ h . &quot;
since 2005 Citiz@@ enship to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge back to im@@ itate the night in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Murray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody was ever charged with murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ concei@@ v@@ ably that in all these years there was not a single person being arrested - although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps with the organisation of reflection . &quot;
&quot; it is a strainer on a story , but it is a burden on our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ past convention of the state Georgia and a life long civil right .
&quot; for him , the reference to him is a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the mon@@ ro@@ e community that a w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want criminal proceedings , we want to be ending , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation , until we get justice . &quot;
a Jur@@ is@@ zin@@ ok puts a bed sc@@ ro@@ ud on the dead of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ne on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI files , which were obtained by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding Graf@@ ine were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch process . &quot;
but nobody has ever been charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been on free foot for decades , citizenship can say that double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 made it possible to make a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of the black citizens in Georgia for the first time , in the summer to vote their vote in the summer . &quot;
&quot; at about the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to specifications of the F@@ BI of the black Far@@ mp@@ ico Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , bar@@ nett h@@ ester , during a battle - supposedly due to a woman . &quot;
&quot; Bro@@ oks said , the smells in the city have been that H@@ ester with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy slept and that the baby , which she carried , not from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 Dollar to free Mal@@ com from the prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Murray and George Dor@@ sey for the prison .
&quot; but when they moved away from the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch mo@@ b surrounded by car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison that has prepared and arranged the Mor@@ rison , which closes it out of a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in the murder , and the identity of witnesses raised . &quot;
Bro@@ oks form@@ ulates it still pre@@ mer@@ ry .
&quot; it was a &quot; &quot; right @-@ mass@@ acre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register yourself and if you vote , then this will happen . &quot;
nearly a decade of Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene led the annual im@@ position of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
&quot; their presentation is vivid , grasp and substanti@@ ated in a kind of profound racism that many believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to look , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we then deal with its u@@ gl@@ iness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build any relationship with you , if you do not want to listen or hear what I have made . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year of production began in June , and on the first day at nearly 30 actors - a dozen grain and the rest of the Black - have a well @-@ played view of the piece started . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the boss @-@ C@@ lan@@ co gli@@ eds for years but he said , the role will never become easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to preserve this story alive , because we would not want to return to those days . &quot;
on the other side of the room rehear@@ sed the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester .
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , who scre@@ amed H@@ ester and qu@@ ake him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , s@@ win@@ ch of my property ! &quot;
la@@ cona le@@ pers the fire .
there is a break .
and then each ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs in the lou@@ der .
&quot; what ? ! , asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , always cold . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think that white people back then &apos; n &apos; --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; &quot; funny one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you only need to meet the &quot; &quot; hard &apos; R. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and this is exactly where the energy moves in space , a sense of compani@@ onship , replacing the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy doing this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts at once again .
&quot; this time , if Ras@@ cona the N word says , he says it sharp and with pressures . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this re@@ petition ends non @-@ violent and fast .
there is Schre@@ ie , kis@@ ses and then silence .
&quot; a woman cloth@@ ed with a dream @-@ dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actor and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays mo@@ ur@@ ring lob@@ ite &quot; Str@@ ange Fru@@ it . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks with each second word .
about a hundred meters left behind it a group of about four dozen spect@@ ators of silence and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost even@@ ly between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , promp@@ ted to see the performance , many come just down the road . &quot;
&quot; they experienced almost eight hours of Georgi@@ as , when Bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; up to this point , the Mor@@ de stayed a an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de , the air feels sh@@ ep@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to get closer and insp@@ ects the body name . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ ck at their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the breast@@ feeding body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; fre@@ ts a little boy , as if he wants to remember it . &quot;
after a few minutes it is thanks Gre@@ ene the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch sei@@ l away and wi@@ pe its tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the move that has played the C@@ lan@@ der . &quot;
&quot; Nick Ras@@ cona um@@ ar@@ ded two of his fellow @-@ players , and then break up into their arms , having the emotional burden of performance after him finally . &quot;
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience turns together with the actors for dinner .
ch@@ atting on a table a white pair of Atlanta stimul@@ ated by the viewing with a black couple that they have just got to know .
&quot; Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought hard to find words , which has left the performance . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you yourself and what they do , because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me , makes me believe that the Lyn@@ n is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; today , this is called Police @-@ shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks Hof at his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of civil rights . &quot;
he said he has already begun to plan the performance over the next year .
&quot; the im@@ itation is in some ways inspir@@ ational , because it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have end@@ ure , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s like we learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history is condem@@ ns to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &apos; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monum@@ ental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf is set to a multic@@ ol@@ oured st@@ aging culture . &quot;
&quot; the turning stage ( designed by Alek@@ sand@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows op@@ tionally a s@@ hab@@ by street corner including mas@@ rest and D@@ ön@@ bu@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , an &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR @-@ times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that is an open Mercedes @-@ classic car , in which the Rhein@@ k@@ chter was pos@@ ing as Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; stu@@ ff@@ ed O@@ il@@ an@@ ser remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - that draws itself through his &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; -@@ st@@ aging . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhin@@ estones - sung by Stephanie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl , and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ieren like in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; . &quot; &quot;

Stephen M@@ illing sings the glorious h@@ agen that surrounds the au@@ ra of a heavy weight box@@ er .
brutal the scene as he suggests .
later also Gun@@ ther ( Markus Ei@@ che ) must also believe .
the audience ow@@ es it to the ensemble with vigor@@ ous appl@@ ause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Di@@ rig@@ ent Jan@@ owski , which con@@ form@@ ly distor@@ ted the hands of the Merkel smo@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; big appl@@ ause is available for the festival orchestra , which shows itself for the first time on stage - given the large heat back in casual leisure . &quot;
&quot; with regard to voltage was expected , the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ ete@@ am . &quot;
&quot; had he had to let in 2013 have a gell@@ on Pfei@@ f@@ concert to make sure , there were five years later great rejo@@ icing in which the &quot; &quot; be@@ h &quot; &quot; guided tour went down . &quot;
hard@@ ship Katharina Wagner is likely to be happy about this .
&quot; one noted that the audience has grown up with the &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; in some way , she had said shortly before the launch of the d@@ pa . &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf but also has an understanding of this view .
I refer to a positive balance .

&quot; Pear@@ son shorten@@ ed additional 3,000 jobs and abbrevi@@ ates the divi@@ dend to revi@@ ving the business . &quot;
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will cut further 3,000 jobs and start its divi@@ den@@ ses by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be started to overcome the company with which the company is confronted . &quot;
&quot; the job creation , the director John Fall@@ on predominantly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to his previous restructuring , which had already lost 4,000 bodies . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost reduction program for a further 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to rev@@ ital@@ ise a business , which was taken through the rapid step towards digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which in the last month had expressed its stake in Pen@@ guin &apos;s House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after the first half of the year it achieved a growth of 1 percent to 2,@@ 05 billion pounds . &quot;
con@@ voy @-@ attack of Kab@@ ul : NATO @-@ Sol@@ dier killed in self @-@ care
&quot; a Self @-@ mur@@ derer has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , a soldier in Nato and several others hurt . &quot;
five soldiers and a interpre@@ ters have been in@@ ju@@ red by the declaration of Nato .
&quot; the local reports have reported that in the incident , in the district Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h also three civilians . &quot;
the bom@@ bing is the last violence that has hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday we killed a self @-@ record two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; in a statement of NATO it is said to be the explo@@ ding on Thursday nights , when a joint Pat@@ rol was attacked with the Afgh@@ an army of a &quot; &quot; of people &quot; &quot; recorded explo@@ si@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the statement is h@@ unted that all the wounded within a stable state , and in the U.S. military hospital was treated on the air@@ field of Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , which is known as so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 there were at least 1.6@@ 62 civilian deaths of which approximately 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a su@@ ic@@ ide @-@ highway late at least 30 people in an mainly schi@@ z@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , killed a tremendous bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city more than 150 people with the most milit@@ ant milit@@ ant attacks in the country , since the US @-@ led troops in 2001 over@@ turned the Taliban from power . &quot;
&quot; the violence underlines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US president Donald Tru@@ mp is considering the number of U.S. forces to support the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the self @-@ record company in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policy and especially in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA turns to make a decision to del@@ aying the smo@@ g rule to cl@@ agen
&quot; the US American environmental protection has a decision to delay a regulation of the Government of Obama , in which the states are committed to em@@ ailed the smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 states def@@ endants the agency due to the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ ics 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the obligation of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; EPA approved Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA - in which in a part of the country &apos;s poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions should be measured to determine where inc@@ isions are made to stop more str@@ ingent air quality standards - to delay a year up to October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , made clear to the Tuesday of suit , and said that the effort would be illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to reg@@ ain a wide range of environmental regulations , which the former President Barack Obama has risen , as part of a wider agenda , which according to Tru@@ mp , should boost economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of Democrats and nature reserve that worry about the effects of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the pul@@ mon@@ ary function and can increase the breath@@ less symptoms &quot; like as@@ thma . &quot;
municipalities want community @-@ room
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts , the council of the council of Flu@@ or@@ ns bases the establishment of a community space in the future senior residence . &quot;
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing piece of property was signed and reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades .
&quot; although it is still going to last until the church owned by the church , but there is no plans for a private investor to the breaking project . &quot;
there is a discussion concerning a community space .
&quot; one of the two investors , which are still in the boat , has offered to meet the community . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide an area of living space - approximately 55 square meters , and an adjacent terrace with an almost 70 square meters area for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the management and the majority of the municipal council did not see such a common area just as a meeting place for residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ fair living conditions , but openly in the assembly . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word from &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; took the round . &quot;
&quot; let the decision , which has been decided by providing funds for the current household already last autumn , by funding opportunities . &quot;
building is in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common area would be , so reports T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 percent is viable . &quot;
&quot; the proposed proposal will see to signal the investor that in this respect not want to build a bill@@ ets between the legs , the statement indicating that both Satt@@ el@@ - - what is reduced to the ambient temperature - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which makes the trend @-@ height and the construction of economic power - is possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , not only Wil@@ fred Soh@@ mer , be this supplement . &quot;
when it helps : unanim@@ ously does he happen to be the body .
not so easy it is in common .
&quot; Daniela Call points to the many own buildings , with whom you can &apos;t move pretty much , because Leh@@ ne is now out of the common area out of the window , she says : &quot; I do so hard with it . &quot;
Yvonne Sta@@ iger speaks necessarily for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it sees behind it a co@@ ver@@ able sub@@ contracting of any case @-@ cl@@ ing or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area one does not give any allowance , but only get a real , in doubt place @-@ market@@ able object , the counter is true . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers request to split the proposal accordingly , finds three supporters . &quot;
&quot; so it remains in two counter@@ parts of the original program , Stefan H@@ aller said so summar@@ ised : &quot; &quot; if we grasp the decision , we make a giant step forward , to close a giant cr@@ ut@@ ch in our infrastructure . &quot;
coll@@ ision with car : rad@@ ar is shining on the road
during qu@@ itting the road a 82 @-@ year cycl@@ ist on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath was captured by a car and badly in@@ ju@@ red .

the confirmed the Itali@@ ans on Friday .
&quot; in addition , the Mün@@ ch@@ ers Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ jen Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six years , An@@ cel@@ otti have been responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical constitution , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
that was not least good . &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old now believes in an increase in the first official must @-@ match of the season .
&quot; soccer is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football weight@@ ed holds the fans in their spell .
&quot; the game is sold with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spect@@ ators , distributed the German football league ( DF@@ L ) on Friday with . &quot;
in the Har@@ z from Stern to Stern
in the resin the nation@@ wide first &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; is created .
this is planning the association constell@@ ation Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary path in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a star @-@ path &quot; is contrary to the information for the needs of many hard@@ visitors , it was meant . &quot;
&quot; linking nature , science , movement and spor@@ ty performance . &quot;
members want to exhibit along the planned route and inform about stars and star@@ ches .
&quot; in the first phase until 2018 , the association is planning to reach five to six places in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; In@@ qu@@ ake St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber &quot;
the information on the boards should be added by internet .
&quot; therefore , at the sit@@ ing selection , a good mobile home reception plays a role . &quot;
accessibility is a crit@@ erion .
&quot; later , the star@@ base train to be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star trail , the viewers will experience a lot of knowledge @-@ value , for example about the physics of each stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; they also learn why stars would have different colors or why a star makes stronger lumin@@ aire than another , even though he is much further away . &quot;
&quot; also conv@@ eys , in which constell@@ ation can be a chosen star and when it is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association has already operated in the mountain city of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , which is the highest situated astronom@@ ical observ@@ atory of Northern Germany . &quot;
the location in the middle of the Har@@ z National Park is listed according to the Federal Ministry for Natur@@ schutz to the six most dar@@ k@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y clearly seen with naked eye .
&quot; since 2003 , in the UNI @-@ City , there has been a little simil@@ arity like the planned star @-@ throwing - the plan@@ ade path since 2003 . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ a &apos;s hotel in Goe@@ the@@ all@@ ee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet goes away with its st@@ els up to Hain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ emar@@ ie ( commune ) with the planet S@@ edn@@ a . &quot;
the ri@@ mp@@ s with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ gra@@ di@@ ated Pl@@ uto on the end point - are precisely in distance and scale of one to two billion set up .
&quot; the earth shr@@ ank so on a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meter diameter , whereas the exactly 75 meters are measured about 70 cen@@ timet@@ res . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet driving is about four kilometers .
&quot; while the light of the sun requires about eight hours , walking is a good hour to the St@@ ele with Pl@@ uto . &quot;
pedestrian is faster than the light in the cosmos .
&quot; the march to the next fixed , but would last a half year long . &quot;

&quot; as the couple for photos written , Lom@@ ach@@ enko &apos;s Manager Eg@@ is Climate that would be a possible show@@ down between the fighters the &quot; perfect size &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former ather @-@ weight &quot; , &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I went up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come to light weight .
&quot; and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; , and then we fight . &quot;
we demand the fans .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko voted .
&quot; box@@ ing needs this struggle . &quot;
&quot; climate asked if it should be on Pay @-@ by @-@ View , Part of a strategy , the Lom@@ ach@@ enko held in this year to schedule a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell in the Forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this battle could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all the fans have asked for him , &quot; Gar@@ cia , and op@@ ted later open to cont@@ end with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
none other names can create this kind of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , he loved Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may possibly take part in his Saturday fight . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held on the generous praise for Gar@@ cia , and said that he think the three @-@ fight champion from River@@ side see &quot; very slowly , sorry , sorry , He@@ key ... you want to see the co @-@ Off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show cereb@@ ro@@ star@@ ch , then boxes . &quot;
&quot; they said both , they could feel the momentum they built for their own struggle . &quot;
&quot; this is the fight , which needs to be carried out . &quot;
no other fight creates as much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; I have waited for the Top @-@ fighters and this is Mi@@ key .

four in@@ ju@@ red to T@@ ires
&quot; during an accident on the A7 , four people were wounded and in@@ ju@@ red on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was soon lost before the length of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira , shortly before the junction market , presum@@ ably after a tire @-@ player control over his vehicle . &quot;
the car fli@@ ck@@ wise to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment where he was cutting himself and then lying on the roof of the GRE@@ EN@@ ST@@ RI@@ BES
the four guys - two adults and two children - were severely in@@ ju@@ red during the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the compar@@ ative by the b@@ ail@@ out service , the A7 was locked in the direction of the north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left wing could pass by the accident . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoff@@ mann : &quot; Trinity works better &quot;
Andre Hoff@@ mann hopes after 2 : 2 for the season opening up against Braunschweig that brings the optimization of the def@@ ences in Au@@ e points .
&quot; with the first season , Andre Hoff@@ mann was satisfied with the result , if not the two oppos@@ ites had been at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites at much , and we must fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the def@@ enses of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Ore Mountains the triangle is set to be optimized also further .
&quot; and a gate after an open shift , the For@@ tun@@ es want to be no longer cat@@ ches . &quot;
for the future it will be so that no longer faces Michael ( R@@ ensing ) on the line .
&quot; Hoff@@ mann is convinced that his team also comes better with the experience in preparation with the triple chain , considered with the qu@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; his coach Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , but Hoff@@ mann is sure his thing , &quot; because we have just been able to join the semi @-@ positions in KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o found@@ s@@ el@@ mann players who can well build up well , &quot; said Hoff@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the requirement is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ i@@ ously and we do not afford so many play@@ es . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoff@@ mann goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you can speak after an un@@ decided by a mis@@ informed start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoff@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; but if we can concentrate on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season . &quot;
of this he wanted nothing to know .
&quot; the start into the season I had only after six to eight players &quot; , &quot; Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el said not from an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken down pre@@ matur@@ ely because of an accident . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoff@@ mann believe that players from Au@@ e might even be some fresh , since they would have no he@@ avier and full game like Fort@@ una to the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know as 100 % process where they are currently standing , &quot; says the def@@ enders of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; while the guests from the Rhin@@ eland as easy Favor@@ it on Sunday , finally on Sunday in the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we throw it away , just because we have the claim to come under the first six@@ es , is bull@@ fighting , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet at only a defeat at Au@@ e made of nine games is quite positive . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga that you need to hit in advance , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Chief coach . &quot;
&quot; to meet such a statement , arrogan@@ t and excessive . &quot;
and this is how Funk@@ el will definitely experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum application tests published
&quot; recent findings of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that over 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . however , everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for for@@ en@@ sic medicine ( R@@ ät@@ t@@ sm@@ e@@ dic@@ in@@ al@@ withers ) has started performing tests last year .
&quot; they are supposed to do more closely during the asylum process , after the Swedish migrants authority ( Mig@@ rations ) was critic@@ ised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees . &quot;
&quot; until today Mig@@ rations has 6.@@ 8@@ 80 to test@@ able cases , and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eight@@ y percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in more 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person &quot; may have 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; in those instances , the conclusion that the person &quot; could possibly be under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are conducted only in cases where the person will be questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson by the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are stable in the past months . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases where the person has been judged over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has suffered over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that I propose that the looked for person 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det the 5@@ 81 published results , it turned out that in 243 such cases the person had openly told that she will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , in which x @-@ rays of We@@ iss@@ ors and MR@@ T recordings are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , also has been criti@@ ci@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of biological maturity of people to see if they went earlier or later than usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I have reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
assessing the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we cannot surely say it , we should not do it as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency def@@ enders however the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you may say that the risk of having a child as an adult is un@@ correct . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk lies in it , if the person is just below 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in plan
the works on the three bridges of the Land Highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , seven tonnes of deep emphasis was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it works great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , buil@@ du@@ cts at the department of street industry and traffic in the governing body of the Res@@ eller of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , working on all three sandy bridges began between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the construction time is planned for October and is sure that the schedule is respected .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge made of concrete , which is ar@@ ra@@ yed with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
she was built in the year 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , it is now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure stability and road safety , three buildings are now thoroughly re@@ constructed . &quot;
the two other bridges lead across the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built out of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , and respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach am the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach am on the Wednesday morning on the northern side , a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called dish cap . &quot;
&quot; this is a random , which is also used as a factory . &quot;
at the southern part of the bridge a mere 2.20 meter is to be used on Friday .
this should then be the pedestrian road .
&quot; the particular thing is that it is about pre@@ fabri@@ cation , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented brid@@ ge@@ es .
special finger@@ tips has made the embarrass@@ ment of lines through the building work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; because there is also a glass fiber cable , where many firms are connected . &quot;
the natives were informed in advance of the works by hand @-@ hand information about the project .
&quot; in addition , two fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building and the gathering @-@ gra@@ ined in direction Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic is controlled by a amp@@ el . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work at the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher local entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; is locked . &quot;
the cost of the three rolls amount to 700 000 euros .
financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter protest by German potato salad
&quot; it does not come so frequently that parties go on a strand , but when it comes to bringing the alternative to Germany ( Af@@ D ) , comes along what else is difficult to bring to a hat . &quot;
&quot; the party represented in the chal@@ ance Vol@@ can@@ ians ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad coalition , which indicates that day peaceful flag , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Town Ron@@ dell acc@@ ede to the &quot; &quot; great election &quot; &quot; campaign . &quot;

&quot; however , those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ ro@@ wers but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colour@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All on a table &quot; on the fountain site , but is now on the parking place below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colour@@ ful picture that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair of the forum One World and one of the leading organizers , really happy : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad &quot; , &quot; which could also eat the Af@@ ak without problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police have or@@ ted many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows the presence above all at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues . &quot;
how is the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
&quot; Mario Hom@@ pes was reported by the Af@@ ak Vol@@ ei@@ fel , who tried for such an event and get the surcharge . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from Sem@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation , because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes not enough parking available . &quot;
&quot; so , the Ron@@ del , Hom@@ pes is pleased that we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; with a view to the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the right right to the people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; it also does : at 20 o &apos;clock in the team there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle various speakers , including the Rhine @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ic Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; in the hall are about 200 listen@@ er , waiting for the leaders for the parliamentary elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice @-@ President Beat@@ rix from Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; unchanged is the police presence , but so far the officials had a peaceful evening . &quot;
&quot; somewhat more than an hour will take the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court will have a longer breath , but also there is a short break after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
police can be back - no special needs .

both Solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have den@@ op@@ osi@@ tions in European top @-@ pul@@ ch@@ ests .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the prestigious Con@@ cert@@ geb@@ ouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ist the SWR Symphony .
&quot; both uni@@ fies the desire to cross not only the limitations on their instruments , but also merge the limits of the different gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like with the two like in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; united with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ club &quot; N@@ ils W@@ og@@ ram , &quot; mix classical , jazz , and the free games to an amazing total plant . &quot;
this core part of the program was performed only this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the prestigious composer N@@ ils W@@ og@@ ram was written for the two musicians and wrote more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ ster@@ Church with her special acou@@ sti@@ cs is deliberately included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese and will eat it to the end of their lives .
&quot; but I would like to try everything , &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten ste@@ wart very openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ual . &quot;
&quot; when I stopped in gri@@ lled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh what was cool , what comes next to next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship between Holl@@ y@@ wood@@ stars was the one of their &quot; &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ in@@ son who eventually became bitter . &quot;
despite all the br@@ aces ass@@ ures the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ ter against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with any seriously I thought .
&quot; or do you think about , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; according to her separation Kri@@ sten made it , that she is bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived the du@@ alism and seriously believed in it . &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
I just never liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them , they have been loud &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; but at school time , as they prefer like a book : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really has been very in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; when I was eleven I told me the children , I would look like a book . &quot;
I felt really attacked , fright@@ ened and embarrass@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think of myself : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; particularly the public , she would not like to tell her love life : &quot; people expect you in a certain way and anno@@ yed me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps I call myself some odd , but I don &apos;t like to justify the whole public . &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Saturday night with President Tru@@ mp to change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , Democrats have been away from me , &quot; Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
today I will tell you with lots of prayers and a lot of thinking ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia . I can no longer help if I &apos;m a democratic governor .
the manifestation was dism@@ issed in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the republi@@ cans , &quot; added Justice . &quot;
&quot; as a trainer I would say , that it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp promised before a HU@@ GE announcement in the West Virginia Rallye .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp gained West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; Justice , which is according to For@@ bes , the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes makes firm that he possesses coal in five states , and acquired a carbon @-@ business from his father . &quot;
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee held a statement on Thursday night , in which it said , &quot; &quot; the Party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would be more likely to work towards our country . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 government bodies and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is merely the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without a leadership and unable to find a positive , releas@@ ing message , &quot; said the R@@ NC Mc@@ Daniel in a statement by the C@@ BS News . &quot;
co@@ ed &quot; hon@@ orable &quot; Russian ap@@ ologies for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday , which he described as an open ap@@ ult from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal but he repeat@@ ed@@ ten , it is not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports . &quot;
&quot; Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin , Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ ine during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of athle@@ tics World Championships , that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he is determined to fight the dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; all athletes , who were cut off in cont@@ ests gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite its comments the IA@@ AF Congress to maintain the ban , which was in November 2015 , after a report of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing Agency ( W@@ ada ) had found evidence on stat@@ ely promoted D@@ oping in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was now a very open response , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the re@@ por@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; all the Council and the entire Congress were pleased that Russian Federation has recognised himself , that they experienced some pretty hot times and everything will do possible to ensure that the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot;
he also said he was &quot; delighted that Russia accepted the criteria for his re @-@ establishment .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the congress supported the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the principle principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; ninth Russian athletes compete at the athle@@ tics world Championships , which begin on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as a neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia still meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; Dro@@ gent@@ ests are still inadequate and for@@ er@@ ous trainers were still free , he spoke in London according to a talk at IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
trau@@ mas for in Mali cr@@ ashed soldiers
in a funeral service in the northe@@ ast@@ ess@@ ische Fr@@ itz@@ lar ar@@ isen around 1000 people of the two in a helic@@ opter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high safety precau@@ tions .
&quot; for the still un@@ resolved abor@@ tion , Defense Minister Ursula von der Ley@@ en said ( CD@@ U ) nothing . &quot;
&quot; it marked the two pil@@ ots , but as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of her professional . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are met with this highest sacrifice which they have performed in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; stated them . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year St@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had come to life on Wednesday before a week in the West African Mali .
&quot; her shar@@ k were transferred to Germany and on Thursday , accompanied by a nec@@ roman@@ cy of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Cathedral St. Peter . &quot;
&quot; at noon , first of all the members of the church took place in the church . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral party began in the circle of the family , close friends , from representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics . &quot;
below were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General Staff of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; holes laid down in Roses , the relatives were poor in arm against the s@@ ell@@ gen . &quot;
in front of the church we watched Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers set the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; Defense Minister from the Ley@@ en described the commented soldiers as &quot; &quot; high decorated &quot; &quot; and in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
the St@@ aup@@ t@@ mann lasted the aircraft of the martial @-@ house Tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar with built up and be one of the first six trained tiger @-@ pilot of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the Reg@@ iment , who belong to the soldiers , stated : &quot; if this crew was not able to turn the crash , nobody would have mo@@ cked . &quot;
doubts about the UN Mission in Mali showed Minister of the Ley@@ en not : the application was dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; &quot; for a country where we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral party the bul@@ ge were taken from the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are tr@@ att@@ ed , the Bundes@@ wehr have no information . &quot;
Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik wants no grave beside his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be ad@@ owed to his death next to his wife . &quot;
this shared the Royal House on Thursday with .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish roy@@ sp@@ aar is attached in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard has already bought a coff@@ k@@ oph@@ ag for the two .
&quot; the Queen be with the decision of her husband , it says furthermore in the message . &quot;
where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried ; be still unclear .
but he did not have the intention to be attached to his French homeland .
Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik never made a secret of it that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would like to have been king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 he went into retirement and places the title &quot; &quot; prin@@ cess &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when Hen@@ rik do not get the title and function he wanted , he does not see himself as equal to his wife - but not after death , &quot; L@@ ene Ball@@ eby , the boss of the Danish König@@ sh@@ house . &quot;
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old is ultimately still unclear .
&quot; but he did not have the intention to be attached in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked for over the past 50 years .
&quot; the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ ocr@@ acy , had made Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
in the Thames he worked in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later woman , the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew , had Prince Hen@@ rik in his almost 50 @-@ year reign , with the Dan@@ es a heavy stand . &quot;
&quot; in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I was doing . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was s@@ limmer , I preferred wine instead of beer , sil@@ k@@ stock@@ ings instead of k@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco , and which in this country had the reputation , the brand soci@@ et@@ tical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope of reference . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ash@@ amed me .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Premier Wei@@ l wants to re @-@ election a rapid new election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Nieder@@ sach@@ et Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green registr@@ ations for a rapid re@@ election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to come back . &quot;
&quot; because on Friday , it spoke out for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; earlier , the surprising out@@ let of the Gre@@ ens have led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) over@@ thrown into a difficult crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official event of the elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover lost its scar@@ ce a @-@ vote majority in the Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the previous Green @-@ members El@@ ke T@@ alle organized their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Des@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future at the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;

&quot; in this way , CD@@ U and F@@ DP have attended 69 seats in the ground @-@ Sax@@ on Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship was in@@ verse .
the new governor will be elected on 14 January of the year .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to continue working in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l is however essential that the tag should swi@@ f@@ tly defined its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible . &quot;
the CD@@ U fac@@ tion is expected to decide on its further course on Tuesday .
&quot; the state of the state also sees the possibility that the Prime Minister gave the Prime Minister the trust and cho@@ oses his successor . &quot;
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
&quot; these opportunities must be evaluated legally clean , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; one will discuss all the questions in peace , if they are legally tested . &quot;
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; T@@ west@@ ens &quot; &quot; a bit cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the policies themselves stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it was marked as a tr@@ un@@ ner of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the pur@@ ge members for the return of their country @-@ day meetings .
&quot; we naturally assume that she has received their land @-@ day , which she has received over the green state list , shared with immediate effect , &quot; shared the President Met@@ a J@@ ans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
the presidents of the Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke Great Britain . &quot;
they have deliberately chosen not to conduct any prono@@ unci@@ ation in the fac@@ tion .
&quot; also against the background that there were no differences , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
SPD ch@@ anc@@ ellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the over@@ clo@@ ister of the Sax@@ on Green @-@ Members El@@ ke T@@ Mid@@ west to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ y@@ al .
&quot; the behavior of the former Gre@@ ens Members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ y@@ al of the elect@@ or@@ ate and voters , but also betra@@ y@@ al of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the President of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; he support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , which can quickly choose the country again . &quot;
the res@@ ign@@ ation of T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .

&quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Nieder@@ sachsen makes this dirty input , and seeks to strike from this political capital . &quot;

&quot; Agricultural Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves against tox@@ ins , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discussed via trans @-@ si@@ gh@@ s Eg@@ gs .
how could the sc@@ andal pass ?
how can the consumers protect themselves .
&quot; in the interview with the Edit@@ ing network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) , Mr. Christian Schmidt ( R@@ N@@ D ) are speech and answer . &quot;
Mr. Schmidt : how can the consumer protect against poison@@ ed eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to look carefully at the eggs in your refrigerator and review the stamp .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ nings , the Bundes@@ länder provide the latest information on the egg @-@ batch . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if after all , we are currently aware of a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded . &quot;
&quot; does Al@@ di take over the best possible crisis action - all the Eg@@ gs to get out of the offer , because the central role of the idea is not really perceived by the German agriculture . &quot;
the food surveillance is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has been opened immediately and has been on behalf of the subject of Germany in close exchanges with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
&quot; trade has just as well as the makers to carry out concern that the sold @-@ out products are , of traffic @-@ table and health@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; if with eggs the resi@@ dual content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not rush . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time are not the factories to blame .
do production sites and consumers sit in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the given knowledge , the production sites meets no immediate fault . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must count due to mut@@ u@@ dly illegal practices of service companies with economic damages . &quot;
as always there are in the crop fall too little ch@@ le@@ ure .
is it just missing from the staff or on the hose jurisdiction ?
&quot; there were just the official controls , which have un@@ covered the process . &quot;
&quot; however , the truth of food and criminal energy can never be excluded about 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; it is precisely because of this , a consequ@@ ent education of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where crimes may occur , is of decisive importance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have already clearly stated many times that I expect a complete clarification from the responsible authorities . &quot;
is the regular alarm clock on food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and reduced food .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide used in the food sector , consumers and consumers are rightly ou@@ trag@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; due to the approved resources , manufacturers , distributors and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pr@@ on@@ il in the attitude of food grade animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately . &quot;
&quot; in this case , it must be consistently applied at all levels and with high pressure . &quot;
I expect from all the relevant authorities that the atomic fact is liber@@ ated and seam@@ lessly ur@@ ged .
how to impact the financial rules of Football to N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
&quot; the rules , which aim to prevent exp@@ elled issues of the European foot@@ football , will not distur@@ b the world record from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A , because the leading organisation has been monitoring the power , teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair @-@ Play rules , which were launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A to make a point that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will be tens of ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can be done with certainty the money , so N@@ ey@@ mar goes to and bring him into an galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team by the rich mu@@ ck family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; a must deal with a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must be controlled with legitimate revenue streams which allow them to provide the Bre@@ ak E@@ ven Point in its on the football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini according to his election at the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; former French players believed that in their quest for success had taken tremendous debt , effectively g@@ rie@@ ve and ris@@ ky to ruin , when banks or owners res@@ c@@ ited their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P increased the debt of debt to the surveillance of their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel A@@ br@@ amo@@ vi@@ ch was originally used in Chelsea , a club with potential and then grows vigor@@ ously to build the team and build a global brand - become a tough@@ er affair . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P pre@@ disposition period that runs up to 2018 , clubs can accept losses in the amount of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini 2015 had fallen by the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , UEF@@ A @-@ successor Alek@@ s@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to cry out of excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; for sure , FF@@ P is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , opposite The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for accounting about the duration of his contract . &quot;
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract ( signed ) for the next five years in the amount of 44,@@ 4 million Euros in the annual financial statements .
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has reached the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G earned a fine line of 60 million euros ( back then 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to 20 million euros - and it has been arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players remains limited . &quot;
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit its financial review by connecting their revenues by companies that are associated with the owners of a club .
&quot; whilst a Catalan company could spon@@ ges the PS@@ G if the value of the sponsorship should be default , the UEF@@ A would not apply this as legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA was introduced by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to N@@ ey@@ mar on payments of the Organis@@ ing Committee of the World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar forced to 2022 to find out that N@@ ey@@ mar Cup r@@ amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors will just be able to find out and such a man@@ o@@ eu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to pay attention to the rules .
&quot; UEF@@ A had no pre @-@ prepared talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , f@@ abled to Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2.7 million .
the accounts for the last financial year must be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for sponsorship De@@ als , merch@@ an@@ dis@@ ing and Tri@@ kot@@ shorten@@ ing . &quot;
the association is assum@@ ing that the sales after the signing of at least 30 percent is rising .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated , one of the best football players go to see , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s way@@ point by taking it asser@@ ted that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financing D@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily newspaper in relation to Kat@@ ars last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport @-@ ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that is a association financed . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair , because you can have different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot;

Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rap confirmed on request of the news Agency S@@ DA by calling a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
&quot; in accordance with current planning , the Air@@ line will close a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two or three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , we are very satisfied , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
around 17 million little red @-@ packed s@@ og@@ g@@ it@@ ters about 14 grams per year spread the flight companion in front of landing to the passengers .
about the cost he wanted to do Swiss any information .
&quot; in the area of industry , the volume of orders according to &quot; North@@ west Switzerland &quot; has a total of 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros @-@ subsidiary has an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot;
&quot; however , more important is all the advertising effects : for a car@@ og@@ gi@@ ile , it is a prestigious order . &quot;
&quot; how many applicants are there in the new announcement , the Swiss will not reveal . &quot;
but there are only Swiss manufacturers in question .
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to strive for a renewal of the Treaty on Spring 2018 . &quot;
for the S@@ DA the largest Swiss col@@ ates has not been reached for an opinion .
chocolate @-@ boards spread the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
&quot; before Swiss closed a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry Call@@ eb@@ aut had provided the chocolate tablets . &quot;
the possibility to place the logo led Swiss 1 and a half years ago with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss choc@@ ol@@ ates producers .
in long @-@ distance flights the customers of First Class treats re@@ treats in the business class Na@@ v passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi from Lin@@ dt and Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
in the short route Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi is distributed by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and Economy Class . &quot;

no@@ stalgia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche .
&quot; this re@@ petition of history is simultaneously no@@ stal@@ gic because of the glorious day of the 80 @-@ er years , for the 90 @-@ er years of Gr@@ unge era ( than the pioneers of David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ walter the Sk@@ etch @-@ com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV filmed ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to larger things . &quot;
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally to par@@ ody and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like the time would scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly good , not just because of his absurd Hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for a speaking fl@@ ose vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by going back to the core of the g@@ ags - actor @-@ sized age play spirits children who grow to grow , nevertheless they still managed the im@@ possibility to win the last part of the heat . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , which now play adults , is less emotional @-@ minded and his par@@ ody goes on with the wat@@ ering principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ er years as &quot; The hand That Ro@@ cks the Cr@@ adle &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; on one point there is a character through an Apple @-@ Power@@ Book , some In@@ line Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ ste@@ ward ) , now roman@@ aut@@ or , has not yet forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy mar@@ mal@@ icious lot that is included in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ fe ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a very successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the ex@@ es of the best part of fran@@ chise are .
&quot; it makes a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ ill@@ ons Sub@@ li@@ ppen@@ che of &quot; Sing@@ les &quot; , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; these are the moments of acci@@ dental mad@@ ness that could show this fran@@ chise , Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reaches that which I see as its logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ ET Hot American Summer : twenty Years L@@ ater &quot; , &quot; whose final scene will show the Ban@@ de , how they will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; at Amazon are now remin@@ is@@ cent of a different type of no@@ stalgia : to the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even at &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ West @-@ West @-@ battle . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ edy drama of the 1980s by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka hon@@ ed com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director , a Romanian drama of the ei@@ gh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers of Bucharest , who fight for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the main tro@@ lling - a hard @-@ like Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ R. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , their di@@ alogs of chann@@ eling Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English . &quot;
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
&quot; there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police spend the time to watch chess on television , how Americans are doing it with football ) . &quot;
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including Jenn@@ y S@@ late , Nick offer@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &quot; Fin@@ ding &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is deeply committed to the tru@@ thful propaganda - a mur@@ derer which is a Re@@ agan mask , is involved - that it often happens as a single . &quot;
&quot; with six long episodes , it is moving away , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective , which has been di@@ di@@ ated to a smaller length , could make his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re better , because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef still visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men , who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ burger . &quot;
the imag@@ inary local public is that Western culture can make everything for food for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
strike against drugs @-@ Mafia in the country
the police have succeeded in addressing the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning in the Black @-@ B@@ aar @-@ district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Con@@ stance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searching through , as the prosec@@ utor &apos;s Con@@ stance on Friday . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 25 , 15 co@@ ders were arrested in the age of 25 and 77 and have already issued arrest warran@@ t against this . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officers arrived bigger amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundreds of thousands of euros . &quot;
at the same swe@@ eping time in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there was German arrest warran@@ t .
the two will therefore eventually be delivered to Germany .
on the action both Italian and Bay@@ erische investig@@ ators were involved .
&quot; overall , more than 300 polic@@ emen were deployed . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Mafia is organised crime crimin@@ ality , heavy violence , were accused of murder and rob@@ bery and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; already since summer 2016 , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s Con@@ stance against organised drug @-@ trade in the South German area has been established . &quot;
&quot; between the Public Prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo , a real exchange and the investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the effort held on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; into the spot@@ light of the studies , especially Italian national , with a closer reference to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; even a incident took place on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , in the early morning several shots were picked up in a Gast@@ stätte . &quot;
definite he@@ ents large gaps in foreign citizens
&quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear to be &quot; &quot; one report , the foreig@@ ner Register in Germany indicates considerable shortcomings . &quot;
the lead to partly gra@@ zing mis@@ decisions in asylum @-@ cases .
&quot; the commission@@ er for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Den@@ ner , has drawn attention to a media report , according to major gaps in the country @-@ country register . &quot;
&quot; defects in the there registered data may result in asylum procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; , &quot; possible in an analysis presented by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the Register , the claims of ten million people are recorded with foreign nation@@ als , including approximately 5.5 million from non @-@ EU states . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by about 600 foreigners in Germany .
&quot; because the data have not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts so far has not been good . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who have long been no longer in life , or from citizens who have become German citizens and in which the properties no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data acquisition can greatly slow@@ ed back processes , &quot; it says the report continues . &quot;
&quot; in the statisti@@ c on registration , people may be seized of the EU citizens who would not have to travel at all . &quot;
&quot; however , such false conc@@ eptions have led to a distor@@ ted debate on how to handle compensation , is said therefore in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the federal government has apparently started to return Refu@@ ge@@ es with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children to come back to Italy if they have arrived . &quot;
&quot; this goes forth from an internal paper of the Federal Ministry for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) , the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ amba Newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in the paper there is therefore , the BAM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; regarding families with children , except inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , the paper was practically no longer possible , so the paper below reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees to reach it first . &quot;
&quot; if a migrants travels to a different EU country , this state can send him back to the entry countries . &quot;
&quot; in reason I now write to the office : &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the capacity capacity for families with min@@ ent children in Italy has significantly increased . &quot;
Italy accepted for recording and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) consider this promises .
other EU states would also return to refugees under the Dublin agreement .
&quot; the interior political speaker of the Lin@@ ks@@ fr@@ actions in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , criti@@ ci@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children , due to the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system , and a threat to the child of the child . &quot;
second @-@ measure result
a total of 220 lit@@ res of blood from Ober@@ enrich@@ enbach living persons provided the blood @-@ endemic service for other people .
&quot; at least from the twelve citizens , which were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in all progress , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now distributed 100 lit@@ res of blood in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the municipality in the meeting of the council became the multi @-@ readiness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is great how our body is laid out for it and we appl@@ aud the don@@ ating respect , which provide their blood for stran@@ gers , nor un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; underlined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people &quot; , &quot; explained the circular conductor of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher , because the preser@@ ves will cr@@ ush their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
so many people could benefit from a blood donation .
&quot; at the same time , Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher reported by the promotions made in the spring of Ober@@ ei@@ enbach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved with 114 don@@ ators the second best result , &quot; said the DR@@ K packaging unit . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change goes to a theatre house a few years ago . &quot;

the Bank of England will keep the interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England will likely to be announced later that the interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation took to the spec@@ ulation of a rise .
the Bank of England warned that the economic growth &quot; income &quot; will remain when they retained interest rates on family @-@ income in the midst of a strengthened pressure .
&quot; the political decision makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates on 0,25 % in this month , as weak economic growth , the support for an increase has been weak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and by 2018 to 1,6 % and warned that pressure on the household income would continue to rise to less than 3 % in the autumn . &quot;
&quot; but they are sign@@ aled that in the next few years there would be flu@@ kes to breed inflation , and she said that the credit cost may possibly rise more than expected in the financial markets . &quot;
members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut &apos;s sub@@ package that was issued before a year after the Bre@@ xit .
&quot; it will demand time for finance plan to provide from the coming February cheap financial resources for banks , although it is expected that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after deciding on the interest rate said the Bank : &quot; &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , since the pressure on the reality of households will continue to be bur@@ dened to consumption . &quot;
&quot; interest rates repeti@@ tive that &quot; &quot; a certain tight@@ ening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; at the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; greater &quot; &quot; extent would be required to be the markets . &quot;
the market forecasts for the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; the Bank stressed , however , that increases &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the forec@@ ast@@ ed growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are projected compared with the 1.9 % and 1.9 % in May .
she has maintained its growth forecasts on 1.8 percent in 2018 .
the pound was made after these messages compared to the dollar and the Euro .
the Po@@ unds fell around 0.5 % to the US dollar and fell by 0.4 % to the euro .
the decision does not come to any change after the recent reflected growth figures increase the rising expectations on a path@@ ogen floo@@ d@@ ment and increase the GDP in the second quarter of 0.7 % over the previous three months .
&quot; growth is expected in the third quarter by 0.7 % , although it is easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the youngest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households , affected by an increasing inflation and low paid salary , as the shar@@ pen@@ ing is first worse before it is better . &quot;
&quot; it added that the monetary policy in the next few years can not prevent the in@@ comes off &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages will be able to recover at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is driven to the weak Po@@ unds , which will compens@@ ate for a part of lower consumption . &quot;
the decision will be made a year after lowering interest rates at 0.25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote which caused the t@@ ines of the pen@@ dium .
the Bank appreci@@ ates that it will likely take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; prior to the final Jud@@ gment of the Bank on interest rates , the call for a fork under@@ growth has increased by inflation when inflation increased to hard @-@ over households , whereby three political decision @-@ makers in July ur@@ ged a rise to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has dropped from 2,@@ 9 % in June to 2.9 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and will go back in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said that crossing in relation to their destination of 2 % is &apos; quite &apos; the weak Po@@ unds .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at the Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ ker , said : &quot; &quot; given the recent review of s@@ wap rope , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive again , as the len@@ ders want to look for stores and end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing De@@ als are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll free options and low branches are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is alleged to be a controversial HIV @-@ drug for 10,000 people under controversial . &quot;
patients will be received from September after a struggle in front of the High Court against financing of the drug in N@@ HS access to a &quot; trans@@ atives &quot; HIV prevention treatment .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that an prior to intercourse with prophy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can decrease the Inf@@ ection Ris@@ ko at high risk reduction around 86 percent , now from healthcare service over a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the process after the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ als had confirmed the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice last year , that the N@@ HS had the authority of paying for the pre@@ p despite the claim that local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the Chess announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England @-@ Chief Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; whereas the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) was described as &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health hospitals in London , Bright@@ on , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first to allow the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced to England in April 2018 . &quot;
prevention ( prophy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medication that may be taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p reduces HIV transmission in infectious agents .
taking pre@@ p before the intercourse means that just enough drugs in the body of a person are present to prevent a HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or as long as two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; to those who come for treatment in question include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV positive partners who were not treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; in hospitals will identify appropriate participants that will agree to the study , including men , women , transfers and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known as anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
&quot; people who live in England and registered with a veterinary surgeon , can also register for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic . &quot;
the program will present £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the supply of drugs once a week after an international competitive force .
&quot; the study aims to assess the entire potential of pre@@ p by evaluating the clinical trials , how they are targeted on a large scale , implemented and implemented . &quot;
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should be the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts for contrac@@ eption of HIV . &quot;
&quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p when it is targeted on needs and vulnerable people , the possibility to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people will have high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded trial in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and is not subject to an event with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority now must lie that the study is quickly carried out throughout the country and that nobody has left a risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine has been filed , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected persons . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow of the Department of Health , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome to monthly delay and suppl@@ ementary implementation by the government and over@@ due . &quot;
the evidence demonstrate how transformed these drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention can be and can end the transfer of this life changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will contribute to contributing to the dissemination of HIV in society . &quot;
the big life live : mezzanine and cl@@ ever@@ e designer tricks have turned these little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne L@@ eig@@ h , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , gathered in 2014 by a large house at K@@ night@@ s@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their bags and sold .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex at K@@ night@@ s@@ bridge in a much larger area , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .
&quot; I showed this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings . &quot;
&quot; I have fallen in love with them , and made an offer on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square kilometer has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; originally a one @-@ room estate with a s@@ laugh@@ tered layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne &apos;s storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height . &quot;
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; to this end , she commissioned the architectural and Design@@ studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to make up 12,@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate step in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan has to be creative thinking to release the award .
&quot; the steel station is rather complex , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms as they were over@@ shot , without we had to hur@@ ry ourselves . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but the steel so well that he had the right height for the function above or down . &quot;
this arrangement granted it Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic cl@@ ut@@ shell window looks back from ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us via the gl@@ am@@ orous living area . &quot;
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored Gold@@ furniture , sil@@ ber@@ ne Ak@@ z@@ ente and Vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille L@@ ights make the style for the program . &quot;
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
to both ends is a short cor@@ ridor mir@@ r@@ ored to make it longer work .
in the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance we mir@@ ched units space for all the seating and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; due to the perception of a gl@@ am@@ our@@ less space , the beauty of the living room may close the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
st@@ amped kitchens are nothing new .
what is special about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of In@@ genieur@@ kunst went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the reinforced @-@ reinforced M@@ DF door . &quot;
&quot; it is very important , so when you push the door very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain extra 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and a improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the property , or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on soil size . &quot;
&quot; here they have managed to increase the floor space , while at the same time use high quality materials , providing the room for its luxurious benefit . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional connection in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love yourself in the electric plugs in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
&quot; it shows that an apartment can turn out by a good design and increased square footage of something , which can transform something completely different . &quot;
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave them not . &quot;
brothers fight for a 500 million US real estate agency
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confrontation due to one of the largest real estate imperative Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as worth more than 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developers Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court of Justice to clarify how their property and business shall be split . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict on separation finds in the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , brothers 38 real estate have accumulated worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family purchased a shop on Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co je@@ ans formed there and grew up to a chain of 160 retailers . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ls as well as shopping centers in the subur@@ ban . &quot;
&quot; following an agreement with her dead father , Col@@ in - by Paul has described Col@@ in - by Paul as the main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis , about two thirds of the business association and Paul about one third . &quot;
judicial process states that this means that Col@@ in ownership has a value of € 3@@ 16 million and Paul has a value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents proposed by Col@@ in proposed have left him with that which I kept for the best objects , he wrote in 2015 in a first monkey av@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several anticipated intermedi@@ aries , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers also fight for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claimed , excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in argu@@ ed , that is not true , but raises Paul above to manage some pos@@ sessions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early monkey av@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he hope he hope to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage indicates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and by both sides of the constitu@@ ent law firms . &quot;
&quot; Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the milk bars and delic@@ acy shop from the late 1950 @-@ he and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick . &quot;
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood recumbent , in the Col@@ in the first je@@ ans of the family opened . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co , when he was in high school in my last years , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to pass on their property to their children . &quot;
&quot; Luigi told me often that he never wanted to land the brothers in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis , although Col@@ in claims that Mark to leave the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; Luke as well as Mark , so Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in has kept very back even though he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography of 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case before the courts is . &quot;
&quot; it is very sorry that my brother Paul decided to complain and draw to our family names through the dishes , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a writing to the court that he has tried to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our Father could not have won that Paul and I would end in our current contest , &quot; he said , he said he &quot; still has a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be past .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s new St@@ ef is planning to restrict the media ab@@ stin@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and are failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Pol@@ tico tells that the new St@@ ef of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Tru@@ mp , including reports of news media - hoping to hold the head at a non @-@ reduced course . &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ por@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new St@@ ef of the White House , joining his first working day with leading employees , he presented a main problem to President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House , which he wants to rep@@ ay the hands of the President . &quot;
Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow on him - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have temp@@ ted to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring his media . &quot;
&quot; president Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship with television ranges back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television was still strong . &quot;
&quot; if Candi@@ date Tru@@ mp was up@@ set because of a fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were to convince , &quot; said the former election advis@@ er Sam Nun@@ berg in February opposite of the Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at that time that &quot; the key to hold the Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter &apos;s habit under control , according to six former election campaigns to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a permanent lob@@ b@@ room . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter &apos;s custom ever &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; was ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
perhaps this campaign was something we don &apos;t know anything else - that Tru@@ mp@@ s T@@ we@@ ets could not have with@@ drawn even more against their intervention .
we will probably never know anything about the T@@ we@@ ets which has not sent the Tru@@ mp .
&quot; if his team succeeded in keeping it up a number of times , who kept away from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
but no one has consistently prevented it that Tru@@ mp checks .
&quot; a part of the problem is that people in a White House , which brings themselves together from competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by providing Tru@@ mp material that may possibly help their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - quite busy with this history - reported in May about the preference of the consultants , the president for strategic reasons . &quot;
&quot; this was an example , described by re@@ por@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher : &quot;
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp @-@ officials say that Tru@@ mp can react to negative press sections , especially those with sh@@ ame@@ ful le@@ aks , and that he can find out to figure out how these origin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; exactly that happened at the end of February when someone gave a printed copy of an article by Got@@ new@@ s@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who described the dep@@ uty s@@ ef@@ in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a p@@ ile to be from Lec@@ co &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of his ic@@ ans , or that he has not offered a concrete evidence , or that he vo@@ iced in the past false prejudi@@ ces and re@@ vo@@ ke it . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp read the article and started to ask employees about Wal@@ sh , too . &quot;
&quot; added that the dam@@ sel Stab@@ sch@@ ef Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage the paper@@ work and document the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly temp@@ ted three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as the most effective manager as a pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ si@@ ves Self , and his consultants still seek influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
Master o@@ iled crimin@@ als get post by Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the aid of the population will worship and hop@@ ed . &quot;
the police have sent throughout Europe this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to hazardous crimin@@ als on the run .
&quot; as the addresses of the sought @-@ broken sword is unknown , they are hop@@ ed and pray . &quot;
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the promotion which follows the &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; Advent@@ ures of Winter .
the experiences could have shown that many wings of holiday destinations are hidden by Euro@@ pol .
21 post@@ cards have put together 21 post@@ cards for searched crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the site www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ asis has been viewed more than 2.5 million times this year . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the line requested could be captured until now , at least eleven of these are based on references after the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; milli@@ on@@ aires series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back again with some resol@@ ute travellers on the war of war , who have tr@@ aded one from the municipality extended to demand a field in front of their men &apos;s houses . &quot;
the travelers have called their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a wealthy road from Soli@@ h@@ ull that is called the &quot; milli@@ on@@ aires series . &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of transport , after they were turned out in May , without having been de@@ ported to the atro@@ city by one of the Council to prevent their accidents . &quot;
&quot; the tac@@ kl@@ ed group found a gap in the defense units , and thr@@ ust their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way . &quot;
&quot; angry inhabitants have pushed the advice of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which said that it was &quot; useless &quot; to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous resident said , &quot; You are held there on Monday after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath , where they were cast stones on the pas@@ sers . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced by shame , as he had been useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
the travellers were in May there and were moved forward and are now back again .
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it , by keeping a long instructions to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on the stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my common thread , if the Council cannot stop that . &quot;
&quot; a dwelling that did not want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it is ridicul@@ ous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers to be pl@@ under@@ ed only by another round . &quot;
&quot; this time , the numbers have increased and one even has a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; a speaker of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said , &quot; We are aware of a unauthorized camp on the country beyond the Bu@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so as to move them as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our evidence , it is very important that as many natives are a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling the 101 . &quot;
&quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation where the judgment should check , when we do our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ yard is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the Freu@@ den@@ stadt house is being renovated and is scheduled to be opened on 1st March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with closure of the hotel Birken@@ yard by the dam@@ ous Ambiente Li@@ gesellschaft mbH , on the 13th of April 2014 , there was approximately 30 000 overnight stays per year and also revenues by the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , given the rise in the figures of refugees that came to the district council , the hotel building offered as an umbrella accommodation , which cat@@ ered for contro@@ versy of contro@@ versy . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers through the presence of a construction plan to secure the area as hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at that time at that time .
&quot; but above all the Freu@@ den@@ stadt Upper citizenship , Julian O@@ ss@@ wald , defended the hotel location and spoke at that time from ern@@ ern@@ ing prosp@@ ective buyers in the house . &quot;
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with business guide Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object four houses .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof have been standing at the entrance for a longer period of building container prior to the entrance , and when one enters the house , what great renovation work will be made . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils were demol@@ ished , blankets to the part ab@@ bles , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is converted , there are new windows . &quot;
&quot; everything was later &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expres@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewelry piece out . &quot;
&quot; pool , wellness and a meeting room are at the facilities . &quot;
&quot; it should not be positioned itself at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bath , but already in an up@@ scale city level , empha@@ sizes Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms is set up wide , and explains Sch@@ aller . &quot;
&quot; both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or busin@@ ess@@ men should feel at ease in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tour@@ director Michael Kr@@ ause , he has already led , so Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the ideas of the city are covered with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer will not want to determine precisely . &quot;
almost under a million Euros it expects .
&quot; outside , the outdoor areas are brought to the front , that is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard , a large terrace comes into being accessible from the restaurant , which is publicly available . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : us @-@ Special Jury sets the Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia @-@ monkey around US president Donald Tru@@ mp , Robert Mu@@ eller will have to use a so @-@ called Grand Jury for a report . &quot;
&quot; the Panel started working in the past weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; on appeal to the matter of trust . &quot;
the paper valuable the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded its investigations and intensified .
the sender CN@@ N reported it will give you first anc@@ est@@ or@@ ations of the body in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s and Russian Ombud@@ sper@@ son .
us intelligence services accused the Krem@@ lin for some time to target@@ edly inter@@ ming@@ led in the presidential competition in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there was agreements between Tru@@ mp@@ s El@@ ection team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of investig@@ ators , several men are standing in the electoral campaign as a consultant of the republi@@ cans . &quot;
&quot; according to the results , Mu@@ eller also took more and more trust@@ s private and business environment among the magni@@ fier . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago , that the Com@@ er@@ ator Tru@@ mp has moved personally to the center and the accus@@ ation in the course of the affair may hin@@ ders the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine and determine this evidence in possible rup@@ tions , and to decide whether indic@@ t@@ ment should be charged . &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also referred to counts .
&quot; mostly , they are switched on when it is about bigger and contro@@ versy . &quot;
the procedure is always provided behind closed doors .
&quot; the Panel may also be switched from the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office , to download people to re@@ use under the E@@ id . &quot;
&quot; according to the CN@@ N channels , already issued inv@@ itations to the meeting between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ R. and a Russian Ombud@@ sper@@ son . &quot;
individuals who were involved in the meeting may be asked to a statement called it on the report .
&quot; furthermore , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; besides Tru@@ mp J@@ R. , Tru@@ mp@@ s consultants and swimm@@ ers Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his former election chief Paul Man@@ a@@ fort at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday night in the U.S. television set that meeting @-@ up show that Mu@@ eller should not be absorbed in his work , and that he should be necessary if it should be necessary to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned in the end to decide on the collection of an indic@@ t@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the suspension of the body is the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason for President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the president on Thursday night took a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia history is a total invention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the issue give the democr@@ ats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about whom they can talk . &quot;
&quot; his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b , explained in an opinion , he bug nothing about the installation of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but this also usually work in secret , he said . &quot;
the White House challenged all measures that accelerated the work of the special agent to &quot; fair &quot; way accelerated .
the former F@@ BI Chef James Com@@ ey said three times that not to be established against the President .
there is no reason to accept that something changed in the statement on it .
Mu@@ eller was only been used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had folded .
&quot; because of this ran@@ ge@@ es , accus@@ ations had become loud to Tru@@ mp , to hin@@ der the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; in June , Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp have asked him for an adjustment of the investigation against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president stands for the study of great pressure .
&quot; according to the presentation of U.S. media , the White House gathered the material against the Sonder@@ geld and its employees . &quot;
the proceeds spec@@ ulations whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller released .
&quot; unlike an independent distributor of the Congress such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , in order to later rec@@ alled President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has led a position in which it could be termin@@ ated theoretically on ur@@ ging the President of the Justice Minister . &quot;
several Sen@@ ators of both parties want to take one step but prev@@ ent@@ able .
&quot; two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators stood before the Thursday law , after which the special event could no longer be released . &quot;
Antarc@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ eberg drives in the Antarc@@ tic
&quot; in the western Antarc@@ tic , a gigantic ic@@ eberg is solved by the nearly seven @-@ year size of Berlin from the Shel@@ f . &quot;
that divided the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar@@ - and maritime research on Wednesday .
&quot; across a Bil@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square @-@ kilomet@@ re large pist@@ on t@@ apping now to the north and will probably take two , three years if he mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; it is estimated with 175 kilometres length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , one of the largest ic@@ e@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
a danger for people is not affected by him .
&quot; to what climate change has played a role in the outbreak of the ice age , still unclear is unclear . &quot;
&quot; however , it has been a series of unusual inter@@ rup@@ tions of ice r@@ ink in the region , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact@@ ant background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be together with the warming . &quot;
the now desc@@ ended pist@@ on was so far a part of Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ fe@@ o .
Shel@@ fe@@ ats swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it thus grows further into the sea and breaks regular off .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ is is located south of South America almost at the head of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula .
&quot; in the north of this Shel@@ ter , the balance of wax and de@@ break was disturbed several years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete Schel@@ fe@@ ather is there , writes AW@@ I @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; it is a lot to speak that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ s is in danger , as the cau@@ tious turn has never trac@@ ted so far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice @-@ plate also stand under tension and can dis@@ integrate , if in a key point , a piece of break@@ down . &quot;
&quot; the mel@@ ting of Schel@@ del@@ s and ic@@ eberg increases sea level , as they swim in the water and put on ice as much water as it will melt after the mel@@ ting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of this attack is leading that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much more quickly than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in the light extent , the British research project writes in the observation of the Antarc@@ tic ( MID@@ AS ) . &quot;
&quot; the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ s is the district of AW@@ I @-@ particulars , with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the district of the Antarc@@ tic of the Antarc@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front @-@ edge to the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks up regularly .
&quot; although it &apos;s a natural happening and we have no direct connection to climate change , the ic@@ tag comes now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most extensive retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he confirmed . &quot;
&quot; under scientists , there is disp@@ uted whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C dec@@ ay will now grow again or go back long and possibly merge together , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but these developments will last decades .
&quot; even if these researchers fail to change the break@@ down of this giant ic@@ eberg not on climate change , so many of the king@@ doms of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula are des@@ erted in the past few decades . &quot;
this long run of Antarc@@ tica covers direction South America .
&quot; according to data from the British Antarc@@ tic Survey , the iron area of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula has declined since the 1950@@ s by 28 000 square kilometers . &quot;
&quot; to the decline , the temperature rose has contributed . &quot;
&quot; the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula have passed over three degrees in the past 50 years , and en@@ vy in the areas where temperature at the fastest growing clim@@ ates . &quot;
CD@@ U wants cut off at the staff
&quot; because it is becoming more difficult to occupy freely configur@@ ing places , the CD@@ U is calling out of the employer association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; just before the summer break , the Krei@@ dler has 41 new jobs in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now even 17 trainees have gone their first working day after themselves .
the teachers in the circle are clearly very popular .
some 620 applications were to be found in v@@ ain places for those in this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle continues to be employed personal , in order to cope with the increasing requirements and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there is still 50 non @-@ occupied positions at the circle of M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration are needed . &quot;
the CD@@ U would now want to seize the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative and capture the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
the management should develop according to the wish of the parties &quot; a concept for recruitment and human development . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to cover , not only short @-@ term needs for expert leaders , but future @-@ oriented of the application cr@@ app@@ y , is stated . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be based on inside and outside , to show concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers , and to include a training defensive system , request CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds already a good approach .
&quot; for the circle has nothing to do with personal problems , which you had never known earlier . &quot;
other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
the speech is given by a regul@@ ator &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot;
&quot; this includes a high number of employees , the disease , or altern@@ ate @-@ conditioned of the service . &quot;
&quot; so high time for action , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; however , Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , talks about the common request with his party . &quot;
he ru@@ ined un@@ long ago in the chal@@ ance for a worth@@ less surprise when he asked the human @-@ deck@@ er publicly and the rest of the parties were amazing .
&quot; people want to be checked that all possibilities are reviewed , which made a out@@ let out of the communist work @-@ association . &quot;
&quot; if we are not able to get to a satisfactory solution here , the br@@ ink with trade unions should be stri@@ ving in collaboration with the county cities - perhaps also in co @-@ operation with the county @-@ owned cities . &quot;
&quot; in order to pay the CD@@ U , the employees and officials to pay better than the collective service is actually looking for . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently being prescribed , enh@@ ancements or more money there is only if you switch to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years . &quot;
&quot; however , the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years . &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which presented to the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law . &quot;
&quot; last but not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ Director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ated the tone to NGO @-@ migrants
&quot; Italy has stimul@@ ated the NGOs to use the lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they cannot continue this if they don &apos;t comply with new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs don &apos;t submit a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work on , &quot; said Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner Daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ niti@@ s warning came one day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; youth R@@ ettet &apos; , because their crew employed effectively with men &apos;s retailers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the aid organisation , which has only been in operation since one year , to express themselves detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian Public Prosec@@ utor of Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the saving of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry to operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; said the organisation in an opinion about social media . &quot;
&quot; we are able to gather all alleg@@ ations , which are currently collected , after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had been the boat of &apos; youth R@@ ained &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that its crew takes tu@@ din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board , which can be delivered directly by human retailers , and that sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be able to use the ships again . &quot;
&quot; after at least one such coincidence , only 1,3 miles before the Libyan coast took place , according to the brief@@ ing of the public prosec@@ utor , the content of Italian media has been published . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of the authority of the Italian coast , the lif@@ ebo@@ ats in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives , is hin@@ dered . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats , such as I@@ u@@ v@@ enta have to pay above all an Italian police officers on board that monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations , have previously agreed to keep themselves up to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable they would not bring &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their lif@@ ebo@@ y actions . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel @-@ Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organisation doctors without borders ( M@@ SF ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants in Italy arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy , in recent weeks the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast and carried out the cooperation with the local citizens . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month , about economic development initiatives and with Cer@@ ad , N@@ iger , and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants that can leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe . &quot;
pins and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berliner out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ s@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region , to enjoy four days of tri@@ une and sights . &quot;
three be@@ friend@@ ed guides available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for tours .
Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour conducted during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ sk@@ ap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; it was followed up view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the fal@@ si@@ zer forest and the pre@@ matur@@ ely levels . &quot;

on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ firm litter market .
&quot; again , look@@ out look@@ out at the point of view , connected by &quot; flo@@ cks &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
during the last two days a lot of Al@@ titude have been canc@@ eled .

console instead of la@@ wns - Bundes@@ liga ge@@ ars up for E @-@ Sport
&quot; sit the sport stars in the future before computer consoles , instead of being under@@ going through wind and weather over the stadium of the stadium ? &quot;
&quot; fact is : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious industry , has become a lu@@ cr@@ ative deal - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high passages . &quot;
they have also recognized the first federal states that are increasingly involved in this field .
&quot; the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded in the middle of July an e @-@ sport department and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to ama@@ ze new young audi@@ ences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says the Board of Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; it is certain that on this turn , it is still a lot to rise up . &quot;
&quot; on the coming weekend , the World Cup of FIFA in London is organizing the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of various clubs will compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven . &quot;
also Robin Dut@@ t looks great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Lever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now an agency for virtual soccer player .
&quot; the real football must deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ old , that young people will still go into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : trying to conquer any possible markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ Sport@@ sman under contract , you could be much more often present on these markets than once a year to send the Bundes@@ lig@@ am@@ ship to Asia once a year . &quot;
what are we going to do exactly ?
&quot; in the E @-@ Sport , computer games like &quot; League Of Legends &quot; , &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or even the football simulation of FIFA on competition level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in normal sports also , Li@@ gen is well @-@ established , in which the pros can compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in Asia , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it a correct sport ?
for many the idea is certainly unusual .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bery has long been dealing with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ tho@@ ch@@ schule in Cologne is e @-@ sport a sport , because he &apos;s fun@@ tive and found many biological and physical reactions that one can also find in classical sport - for example , increased heart rate , stress levels , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it took cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick responsi@@ veness . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should not only be in the console but also train their body and watch the nutrition .
&quot; the fine player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; not@@ ing also looks problems : &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a subject . &quot;
controls are hard to manage and in the scene failed the structures of classical sports .
scientists clearly highlights the scientists with the high inclusive effects of e @-@ sports .
&quot; the players are internationally on the road , which is like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural shirts . &quot;
a study conducted by the company advis@@ ing Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federation of Inter@@ active Enter@@ t@@ ein@@ ment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the e @-@ sport a rapid growth .
&quot; in 2016 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly about advertising , sponsor@@ ing and great tournaments . &quot;
sales of 130 million are expected in three years .
against the almost 2.1 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga the Bundes@@ liga is very little .
&quot; however , the E @-@ sport is not far from the other established sports like hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hock@@ ey , write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant . &quot;
international countries are already continuing .
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez co@@ operated by the US Team NR@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actors Ashton Kut@@ cher is investing in the e@@ Sports competitions Uni@@ cr@@ n .
also in Europe does a lot of things .
&quot; in an Norwegian school , e @-@ sport had been introduced as a class@@ rooms , says F@@ rob@@ bery . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France the football @-@ liga are committed to Dut@@ ch@@ re , according to Dut@@ t , a E @-@ Sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ ging behind , &quot; declares V@@ f@@ B @-@ Board of R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; fall in no@@ stalgia and clear the old times , is no longer sufficient . &quot;
&quot; it is a question of preserving the tradition of the organisation , but the company is at the same time to focus on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ tised world , &quot; says also Dut@@ t . &quot;
&quot; it is not possible that only in football everything remains as it always was . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter because of the lyrics , the Con@@ rad Roy racing to the su@@ ic@@ ide , &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her friend through lyrics and calls to su@@ ic@@ ide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to par@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; Carter was condemned in June due to the casual killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the Father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ com@@ for@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free up to the appeal .
&quot; it had been confronted with a top sentence of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy have suffered a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red H@@ oses and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter is standing with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down @-@ ted eyes , when it was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have brought Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office . &quot;
she ended his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility taken over , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , Car@@ dinal lawyer said , it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance which she is completely de@@ plor@@ able . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find that their &quot; age or maturity or even their mind @-@ disease has a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor has a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , the said that there is &quot; no day on which I don &apos;t smoke the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want to be proud of me and as I am with everything . I try , in spite of all my p@@ ains that we will carry for eternity with us , for his sisters will be there . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will be prosec@@ uted by the recognition , &quot; I will never be participating at the wedding of her brother or a a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; not to have this single person together with which I have been together every day since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep in mind for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to put a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to commit a different self @-@ commit . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was dead in a car in 2014 when Roy was dead in a car .
&quot; the case attracted national attention on themselves , after Car@@ ters texts revealed that they had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; keep you sailing from a building , er@@ ste@@ ed yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she told me in several news that she had sent them in the two weeks before his death , while he was on holiday with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his su@@ ic@@ ide she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; All that you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter attention was sought by the death of Roy and ord@@ ained that she should benefit by any press from the case .
the case has the legal opinion shared .
&quot; the few , the Carter defended , belonged to the Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , which was condemned in 2007 because of the murder of their British co @-@ hostess in Italy before it was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in Los Angeles Times make a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not in prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learn from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
&quot; that Joshua sounded me at the Audi Cup as captain , is not acci@@ dental . &quot;
the FC Bayern Tr@@ aut to the Con@@ fed Cup winner a big season to - extra motivation is not ground@@ ed there .
&quot; what was different in his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ me immediately , although the extra clothing was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but since far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course there was no Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er to see , he made himself shared bonds with his arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as Bavaria @-@ captain . &quot;
&quot; good , who could have run better than the 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the character of coach could also interpret me so .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was in the youth playful , de@@ clin@@ ant and just chosen from the holiday professionals existing C @-@ el@@ f as a leader . &quot;
&quot; in sugar , you are most ende@@ avor@@ ed to those who want to have a lot of sugar to keep in La@@ une . &quot;
&quot; so who was au@@ ser@@ k@@ ors to block the heritage of Lah@@ m , a small extra motivation can only be used well . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; &quot; this is what one wants to take as a player : responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
&quot; right behind , this is now its position , the white bin@@ de on the arm did her rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ ber@@ am in this start@@ formation , such as the one who can take the ruin into the hand . &quot;
he gave instructions to direct the ab@@ sent tro@@ upe .
he had the look for the whole while many others were busy with themselves .
&quot; Vid@@ al thus , to over@@ play its missing fitness ( fol@@ dable ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on the devil came out to the achievements of the Asia @-@ trip ( fol@@ dable also only conditioned ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ ver not neg@@ atively affected in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
this all un@@ folded very well .
&quot; Sü@@ ves ran alongside Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both ag@@ inated sou@@ ver@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the renowned Nap@@ oli storm , often did heavy , and also tried addi@@ le successfully in playing a few times in the playing building . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy gave in fact that the result was &quot; not like , &quot; as we hop@@ ed it . &quot;
but even he showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; song writing , tempor@@ al change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as unusual , this Bavaria world is still used for the new printed site , we saw a connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy for example was in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ me spoke after a few scar@@ ce statements about his back of his new fellow players .
&quot; there he heard about South Korea an interesting set : &quot; &quot; what goes here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; at Bavaria you just have to win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he does not have to teach the new ones more . &quot;

company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz region : business pra@@ ises Wis@@ dom Tempo
&quot; the relationship between the country and the regional economy was so often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , an Ministry of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate . &quot;
&quot; this is reflected in more than one year , where the new economic Minister , Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region speak at T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and impeccable at the same time the old minister .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ er enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing takes care of the desires of the economy , the Lem@@ s all@@ es@@ amt blocked . &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around of Nat@@ us sees in infrastructure areas : the mot@@ if of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now up @-@ to @-@ date list of the country quite up .
this year the Ministry for a plan@@ ing process until 2021 is supposed to be the building right .
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the Western h@@ egem@@ ony tri@@ er , which is on the more urgent need of the Federal Convention . &quot;
&quot; if the goal is to take the route in December 2020 , says Minist@@ ries of Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
&quot; Nat@@ us sees this as a sign for regional , but internationally competitive businesses . &quot;
&quot; the industrial and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Tri@@ er asp@@ ires , as seen from Wis@@ sing , at the wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate @-@ label to stop the sales in supermarkets and stopping the trend of the leading German wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; also , Wis@@ sing have an open ear for people who want to start up their own company , lo@@ aves the Chamber of Industry . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Cr@@ afts Tri@@ er sees in the new master bonus an added incentive for young trainees , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; an increase of 1000 euros is intended for the best champi@@ on@@ set of 1000 euros , if gradu@@ ates are independent within 10 years after the master education . &quot;
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; in the scheduled road construction , they were quick facts to create , at the same time fail@@ ures it to the land on the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , captain of the Chamber of Commerce Tri@@ er . &quot;
&quot; of 56 new engineers , the Wis@@ sing wants to set the Ou@@ den@@ sing in the state of mobility , is up to 29 places . &quot;
the Chamber of Industry demands more orders to be awarded on external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U @-@ Fr@@ ac@@ vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the accounting , the country invested more than EUR 20 million euros less in the preservation of inland roads than proposed . &quot;
Frank Nat@@ us is also expecting a concept of country like it wants to fix the shortage of skilled workers in the region .

Audi should change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face with a counter @-@ reaction
&quot; one day before the Audi announcement told BMW , that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 cars . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Group said the company is in the opinion that &quot; &quot; intelligent options as driving restrictions exist , &quot; &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based on diesel vehicles - diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daim@@ ler announced on Tuesday that there are three million Mercedes cars in Europe to modify its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as re@@ vocation .
European automobile manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with rules on carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; however , the nit@@ rogen ox@@ ides , the diesel engines , are considered as car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ s and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; to install the cost of automobile manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ alisation of the production of diesel vehicles , take also too , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged to pamp@@ er the mighty car firms and ignore the signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen to prevent the use of so @-@ called cut @-@ out devices to regulate the emissions , if a car has been tested , but with normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees have been tried for Volkswagen , others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former leader of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in Germany by Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and therefore is not protected from delivery and could be brought to justice in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations into Volkswagen to have installed a system to handle the EU &apos;s emissions regulations , and a request that was concentrated on the United States . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the study could bel@@ low the Volkswagen span : the luxury car manufacturer contributes separately to the benefit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ asen and the lau@@ gh against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was time @-@ wise one of the most distinguished Car@@ to@@ on carto@@ on@@ ists , the cel@@ eri@@ ases of his figures are its hall@@ mark . &quot;
&quot; also with 85 , the Argent@@ inian still works and works on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : lau@@ gh , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; during the first few years as an artist , he proposed himself as a sign for fel@@ lowship cards - what was frustr@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris finally succeeded at the end of the six@@ ties : with the publication of his Car@@ to@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artists of cities inspire you .
&quot; large , ro@@ ve@@ able Mor@@ di@@ llo @-@ figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the shooting Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , he was still sitting on the sign , working daily almost ten hours . &quot;
&quot; via calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush @-@ animals and clo@@ cks continue to find his dro@@ wn figures further much spread worldwide . &quot;
&quot; for six years he has also been working on a cartoon and TV series , with its figures . &quot;
&quot; the main person in the movie &quot; &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; is a gir@@ affe - Mor@@ dil@@ los popular animal in his drawings - which has a thous@@ and@@ jo@@ iner as a counter . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie which is to come to the movie screen . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know what they will say , it is strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; therefore he is more focuss@@ ed on the TV series , which is produced as its original designation , wor@@ lessly produced . &quot;
lav@@ ender from Provence threatened by climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lav@@ ender is inev@@ itably reminded of the grounds of dro@@ ught and because of the diseases of the insects , what scientists and farmers who try to find solutions to find great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ ins , expert of the agricultural research institution CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy because the plant has been exposed to the impacts of climate change in the past couple of years and in the autumn much more . &quot;
this has an effect on the li@@ fes@@ pan of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf @-@ nom@@ ads , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil is not only needed for vac@@ ation@@ ers ; it is also very important for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long plant pipes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or curved . &quot;
&quot; so , we have less parts with etheric oil . &quot;
&quot; to the solutions that are considered , include a better water@@ distribution and the slow@@ ing of the dun@@ geon of the ground , but also the radi@@ ating of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties , which are opposed to dry heat . &quot;

the ass@@ ass@@ ination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet for their plans to cover the recent chaos in the state Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and c@@ eas@@ eless drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they told them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure : you are supposed to take their children to the office , who were to leave the goal of an attack with gran@@ ulates , or make them feel at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a black@@ board on the front of the room : opponents , Neutr@@ al , ally . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ por@@ ter to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , perc@@ eptions and abdom@@ inal feel . &quot;
&quot; there are drugs sc@@ ug@@ gler , politicians , busin@@ ess@@ men , journalists who are suspected of the en@@ roll of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest of rest from violence , and throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are becoming involved : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to have taken office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 stand after attacks and threats under Federal Protection and up to now , there was at least seven deaths in seven countries this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , their publisher and their inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence is felt deep , although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which is located on the fa@@ ç@@ ade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , bear t @-@ shirts with glasses or his typical Panam@@ era &apos;s face . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ por@@ ters discuss about their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , Par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although 2010 was created by the German Bundes@@ liga to edit the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee to protect journalists will only have two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of Mor@@ den , each year joined with drug wholesale and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely exposed to justice . &quot;
&quot; with Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still insist that to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are uns@@ tr@@ un@@ east and although the terrain is still a tra@@ it@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very sil@@ ly to w@@ asting my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know that Why do , we distr@@ ust all . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez ran the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the province capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed to drive it just a couple of blocks away , before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was shot out of his car and was shot 12 times , presum@@ ably because of the name of the newspaper - the &quot; &quot; twelve &quot; &quot; river . &quot;
the guns was driving away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown children .
ru@@ mo@@ urs tend to fly free to Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely .
but to the topic Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January , Z@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t battle fields of the country , since ri@@ val@@ ing fac@@ tions are fighting to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot at the road or that the cemetery is full of , two @-@ story mouse @-@ ole@@ s for drug royal , which are bigger than many houses for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of rest , if only a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs traders in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez has been aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , to blame that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ conc@@ eptions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first in February there was the publication of a interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of a ri@@ val@@ ing cart@@ el campaigns in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans . &quot;
&quot; this publication may be anno@@ yed the sons , those members bought every copy purchased from the issue once they have been delivered to newspaper presses . &quot;
&quot; the second fault was in this , Val@@ dez does not force to force the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country into its own safety . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues were ann@@ ex@@ ed that he would always be there .
&quot; he worked as an experienced reporting for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined together with five colleagues for the creation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without affecting the d@@ ote problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; over time , the paper served a reputation because of the cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising revenue . &quot;
&quot; re@@ por@@ ters loved it to be hard to publish hard @-@ informed investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories , which nobody else could handle . &quot;
eight years after the creation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their reporting in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the committee for the protection of journalists for his courage during the persecution of Mexican drugs , where ever they lead . &quot;
he gave himself up to him that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to live on , &quot; he said at the time of CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug @-@ trade in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a lifestyle , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV in the past October . &quot;
you must assume the task that you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many Dead ... why did you not say what went before ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team miss Val@@ dez , the spa@@ wn @-@ bird , who was like a do@@ ck@@ workers , the friend , who was generous with h@@ ugs and advice , a teacher that knew how to survive . &quot;
you trusted to his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and sit there at the same table . &quot;
now ask her : was his love of routine be his destruction ?
his death also forced them to ask her own assu@@ mp@@ tions about how they work best and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you are dealing with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their unc@@ anny and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even at the best times , a high level of self @-@ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ keeping . &quot;
his own inst@@ in@@ ths trust .
if it smells wrong you stay away .
&quot; the trouble is , said the publisher of the gi@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell is a sense that can be mist@@ aken ... and then the thing happened to J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , do not apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a , no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Gu@@ err@@ ero , and other states where a toxic blend of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling floods , weak institutions and corrupt government representatives . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly had no mobil@@ es allowed . days before was known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen reported in front of the heat from 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ floor district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ por@@ ters asked if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , which the governor themselves were considered not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the re@@ por@@ ter went into the mountain scenery , where the drugs were de facto under control . &quot;
for the issue of this week Ri@@ odo@@ ce has built on three main stories .
there was the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the Bru@@ ders of the former known box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an expedition to the State , which focused on the hom@@ etown of the Govern@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; and there was one group that conducted in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; re@@ por@@ ters from public records , that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy , who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , which almost all the century conquered all political levels . &quot;
recently several pr@@ i @-@ Govern@@ ors were accused of corrupt cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the Repor@@ ter , to write about previous events in this restaurant , including one where the son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man had a military over@@ fall . &quot;
&quot; only a few months before , the readers would have viewed the Colom@@ bian of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the ab@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; previously we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; because of its slim physique . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage room for characters and sti@@ ckers , dedicated to the murder of journalists , because the employees have become something that they have never expected themselves : activists from the name of the press . &quot;
re@@ por@@ ter Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez turns out a few signs and went next morning to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the public prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burnt body has been discovered and official say , based on DNA tests that it is its . &quot;
journalists have become tough@@ er in the country by writing them in organised prot@@ agon@@ izing &quot; SOS Press &quot; on obe@@ di@@ ence and structures .
&quot; this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and is trying to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; in a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Val@@ dez accused Ram@@ i@@ rez away the authorities , journalists and bring them around because they have told the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has been asked since then , that she is re @-@ divided by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has been viol@@ ated their obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly called that journalists in Mexico have organised crime , organised crime and a equal society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; , &quot; he wrote that re@@ por@@ ters will not only be killed of drugs , but also on command of politicians and security guards talking to organized crime among a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the media @-@ W@@ äch@@ ter@@ group &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; took over half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials in the past year . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico blessed you , because they want you keep the mouth shut , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the Mor@@ de have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blog@@ ger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern boundary of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; your body was signed together with a note , which was supposedly signed by the Z@@ etas Code &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer @-@ p@@ able and ear@@ phones were beside their separate head .
some branches have elected to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in northern border Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ro@@ sl@@ ava Bre@@ ach in March .
&quot; others continue , as it was El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of its director in 2004 . &quot;
in 2010 Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez publicly directed to the drug card with a editorial article on the front page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have flo@@ wn out of their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they are still watching the roads and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they will be h@@ unted , as was obviously mur@@ dered by the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , three months after the flight from VER@@ AC@@ RU@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; for those who continue to stay , and continue working , it is a daily dance with risk cor@@ ting decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , the once poet wanted to be , gives that the drug @-@ commerce makes him fright@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became re@@ por@@ ter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer , as at once all their phones began to be sum@@ mon@@ ed . &quot;
a series of shooting with Band@@ en@@ ri@@ v@@ als and security guards near the bathro@@ om@@ one Mac@@ at@@ lan had left the dead .
the war continues to escal@@ ate how it was promised by a number of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the boarding @-@ edge they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phone .
the cover site had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens in the vicinity - a further sho@@ ot@@ y in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a look at the polic@@ emen who stopped the watch to see if they were in readiness .
if they fear not at all they did not .
&quot; under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose mid@@ finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , followed the co @-@ workers of Ri@@ odo@@ ce to traces its traces . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; when the same day was mur@@ dered , the train@@ ee was asking me to send them to the coverage of the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs using cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to soft the enemies
at first glance it looks like a statue if a sc@@ ary .
&quot; now , researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible nose @-@ horn of a Canadian mountain worker got so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so well preserved that they could even notice that his bl@@ iss@@ ful skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they told , she would have had something from a &quot; &quot; uncomfortable past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Bi@@ ology , &quot; described it as &quot; the bes@@ tos @-@ protected din@@ osau@@ rs that was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ossi@@ l is a newly discovered kind of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the chal@@ k period from 110 million to 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved condition has researchers , who describe it as a &quot; really remarkable &quot; , &quot; amaz@@ ement &quot;
according to reports in National Geo@@ graphic the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ aters is the best preserved f@@ ossi@@ l of its kind .
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , as he was on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met on something that seemed mis@@ understood by the surrounding rock , and decided to look more precisely . &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l were discovered by him in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2.@@ 500 pounds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) heavy duty .
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you are just a little with your eyes blin@@ z@@ eln , you could almost believe it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it is seen in the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs copies , the mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this plant food is covered , although he is covered with an arm@@ or and a changing tank , probably of meat @-@ sent din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily pi@@ ped din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a par@@ atro@@ oper , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have been allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to soft the enemies , say experts , indicating that it is threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier did for the first time in May and is now visible in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta marked with the Muse@@ um@@ st@@ echni@@ cs Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to un@@ cover it carefully . &quot;
the amazing conservation of the individual enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of sc@@ ales and arm@@ ors about his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ad@@ ation , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ sh@@ aded is usual , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far the animals living today survi@@ ves . &quot;
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs was captiv@@ ated by enough pressure by meat @-@ sent din@@ osau@@ rs that the evolution under@@ mining the confrontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most contemporary animals , which use the con@@ sh@@ ady - think of deer , z@@ eb@@ ras or gir@@ dles - are much smaller and more hur@@ led than loo@@ t , which sign@@ alizes that this no@@ ven@@ er@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong boot@@ y behaviour on a massive , strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs , how dangerous is the din@@ osau@@ rs rob@@ bers of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous . &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their sc@@ ales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs was brown .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal by references about his life , including his con@@ served Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ ted , to find out what it has eaten as its last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs died , when he died , turned into a river and driven into the sea where he s@@ ank on the back to the se@@ ab@@ yss . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alberta was as warm as Süd@@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely much further spread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preser@@ v@@ ative skin , but also kept in three dimensions and the original form of the animal ret@@ ains . &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early chal@@ k season .
&quot; you do not need much imagination to use it to re@@ construct it . if you &apos;re just a little with your eyes , you could almost believe it is alive . &quot;
&quot; the cra@@ yon time was a time , as giant Ther@@ opo@@ da , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that stood on two legs , the earth had gone through . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the bo@@ ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs was h@@ unted by some of its fright@@ ening ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11,@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was converted to the death in the ocean and in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the cl@@ assy din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ aments , and is complete from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have up to 3.000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long bits to rag@@ ged by his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant food was curved through the western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river was floo@@ ded into the open sea . &quot;
&quot; but the underwater re@@ ation of the din@@ osau@@ rs , made its arm@@ or in exquisite detail . &quot;
&quot; the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this particular specimen are so well preserved , that the hood is still hol@@ lows in the din@@ osau@@ rs along the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Geo@@ graphic , such a level of maintenance is as &quot; rare as a gain in the Lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I get it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
&quot; hidden Res@@ ts of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y be@@ ating plates , which carry the sk@@ ull of the beast . &quot;
&quot; his right front is on his side , his five fingers are upwards . &quot;
I can count the doll@@ s at his sole .
in the Stor@@ m : mass am@@ ar@@ tery at A@@ 8 : many wounded
fier@@ ce accident on Thursday night at the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 cars are involved in a mass bu@@ ar@@ aman .
&quot; there are numerous in@@ die , kilometres long distances - and G@@ af@@ fer . &quot;
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) were in@@ ju@@ red on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass bu@@ ar@@ aman for about 20 people .
&quot; according to the initial information of the police were against 17.00 between the terminals , Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a th@@ under@@ storm almost 30 cars , among them probably also lor@@ ry @-@ cr@@ ashed . &quot;
the exact number of the last documents made no information at first .
it is easy to light up to moderate injury , said a pol@@ z@@ eis@@ pre@@ cher .
a great sub@@ committee on b@@ ail@@ out tools was at the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
there was about ten kilometres long retreat in Munich &apos;s direction of Munich .
&quot; like an AZ por@@ ter , it also came on the counter@@ f@@ rail to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ af@@ fer . &quot;
&quot; the fire@@ bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristic of the vehicle , which now have to count with sensitive str@@ aps . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. there was a second accident at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a coll@@ ision between an auto@@ ot@@ ran@@ ty and a passenger car .
a rescue @-@ helic@@ opter was on the road to accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group standings &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : nothing short on the train and sleeps .
or she is deep@@ ened in his work and has just an ingeni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the creator and arous@@ ed a brutal or t@@ ear@@ ing the g@@ ast in the middle of the work@@ flow .
Tim@@ et@@ card check .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn currently Test@@ ed the creator @-@ free driver check .
one simply confirms cell phone that you have taken place and vali@@ date the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test is running on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer comes to , we extend it out . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; said a rail speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; calls the train the driver valuation without work .
&quot; to be able to use the requirements , however , some requirements must be met : one needs a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to have a line ticket - what do most passengers already do .
&quot; you have to also purchased it via the App of the railway , the DB navig@@ ator , what is the easiest way of ticket booking . &quot;
and last you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works fine : one goes into the train , calling his ticket to &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
at the testing customers a button for electronic emp@@ t@@ ings will then be published .
the crew guides get a message on their mobile devices that chassis version is located on the train and is taken in the booked seat .
comes the access companion at the driver check @-@ in place Y knows that there is a passenger with already dra@@ in online ticket .
&quot; so you can go back , continue working . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; those who want to get relaxed without a ticket check through our access staff , tastes in the DB navig@@ ator simply . &quot;
&quot; this allows the passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Executive Board of DB tel@@ et@@ ables . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to address the individual customer requirements . &quot;
&quot; who often drives the railway , knows that besides the delays and missed the timetable controls the biggest difficulties . &quot;
&quot; for often you have yourself , in each case , but one of the fellow travellers do not have any documents that you need to de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either the credit card or the registration pass , or otherwise a document that you have to indicate . &quot;
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train companion and bicycles , resulting in a bad mood in the section or large @-@ room and delays in checking your own tickets and making the work at the end the time takes care of other concerns . &quot;
&quot; yet , only a small number of test customers can use the new service . &quot;
and this also applies to the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further traction numbers on the same track are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to its core .
&quot; just one day after having arrived in New York City , one sat in St. Louis Geb@@ al on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which rented it and scroll through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled on someone from the high school .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child and it is still on the street , &quot; says it there . &quot;
&quot; confused , as no one was posted on her Fe@@ ed the information , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly fre@@ ed on their Tim@@ eline .
&quot; the rap@@ per from the territory of St. Louis was thereby the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed live . &quot;
&quot; he posted an image of bro@@ wns in a lively body , which was out@@ stretched on the street and staying there for four hours . &quot;
&quot; it is wild , &quot; I thought Fer@@ rell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she placed her cell phone in order to get back to T@@ we@@ ets on people at the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people who cri@@ ed up , and from a man who claimed to be the father &apos;s father , who contributed a sign with the ordin@@ ance : &quot; Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
&quot; watching a live Fe@@ ed , where a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a revol@@ t dog . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said , escaped a different polic@@ eman and cri@@ ed , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; Fer@@ rell reminded of their claim . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ ust@@ omed to and which we can call it typical .
at this moment I felt sho@@ ok .
&quot; I was angry , crying . &quot;
you booked a flight back and went to the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 @-@ year old daughter from the house of her father , and decided that the two would go to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and Protest@@ es , of love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the perspective of man who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; when Fer@@ rel with her daughter who carried a fl@@ yers , and a suitable crown , carried out the two a conversation , which they had countless times before this morning , &quot; on the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for it , what they believe ? &quot; &quot; rec@@ alled what she said . &quot;
&quot; we are now going to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year boy and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take them away , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what happens today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it is necessary to know and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution , and what we have to do to free to liber@@ ate ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she is personally experiencing any ec@@ at@@ ant racism , it is not unlike the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I feel , I would give you a bad service to keep them far away . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when they arrived at Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was held to a camp area , considered the activists on the possible non@@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; here , Fer@@ rell and her daughter have been affiliated with a local business holder , the lunch was made . &quot;
they prepared po@@ ckets and helped to pass them to prot@@ esters .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape in the he@@ rell shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed after the 9th of August , she said and notices that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority student N@@ urses Association was and focused on eating social justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in the organization . &quot;
it all came . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met during an evening of Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r@@ ar wanted only &quot; &quot; document &quot; , &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; one question came to the mind : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or do you try to find a story that you can benefit from it ? &quot;
this skep@@ ticism is nour@@ ished by countless cases of people often of white - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and its resistance .
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area , which is known for its activ@@ ism to raise death toll @-@ in@@ mates . &quot;
&quot; his engagement brought the project closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; ? &quot; in the years after Bro@@ wns shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people will be depic@@ ted , because so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on a Ferr@@ an experience - to show that it deals with the movement &quot; not a m@@ essi@@ ah @-@ leader , but a community , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participants in the film . &quot;
&quot; consequently , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ er &apos;s life , as she loves himself and her wife mar@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ rell said , &quot; &quot; said the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I have understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and the in@@ humanity of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ er &apos;s story repeated the role of the black @-@ gay women in the broader black @-@ Li@@ ves movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ ters &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as pregnant . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting in various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women need to wear the main weight of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to remark , that &quot; the movement really is kept alive by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it is obvious that &quot; this is not a affirm@@ ative type of action , &quot; the Fer@@ rell was chosen as a heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sho@@ ok this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not acci@@ dental although she was at the front line , because with a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot;
you can feel your energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the news cameras in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on has long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the church and the police are still pers@@ ist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is at currency for 2 ½ years due to the block@@ ade of a highway in a demonstration .
&quot; it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area , which she calls her home : &quot; a m@@ ess . &quot; &quot;
&quot; still burning them to one vocals and she feels oblig@@ ated to this memory , since she went three years ago in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on on the road three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; Größen@@ w@@ ahn &quot; &quot; : TV @-@ readers are discussing about bit @-@ gallery &quot;
&quot; the bit gallery moves the people , although it is still not built for a long time . &quot;
&quot; but the idea of a shopping centre at the south @-@ standing of the pedestrian zone , has been divi@@ des the population in advocates and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 . &quot;
cold makes the issue barely one .
&quot; on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; , &quot; the subject is discussed . &quot;
&quot; while the one can say to the bit &apos; Gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; That would be real &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ kal ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; needs no human &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ ural ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; Größen@@ w@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advocates , build on that a gallery will move more customers to the city , of which the other businesses take advantage of fear the opponents that then the pedestrian zone . &quot;
&quot; added to this : the gallery will be carefully planned on the property , on which the peasant market hall is , in the 13 direct marketed its products . &quot;
at the beginning of the construction work will be finished .
the Galerie @-@ M@@ acher want to integrate a mark@@ eth@@ all in the new construction - and indeed for Bed@@ a @-@ seat with possibility to sitting outside .
Simone Room : &quot; we have been able to buy nearly weekly at the farmers market for many years .
&quot; mostly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm to always be very happy . &quot;
even the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
&quot; we would like to see that during and above all , after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer . &quot;
in other cities there is also the same .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; &quot; whether to commerci@@ alize the market in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the amount of rent . &quot;
this might not be exactly low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping ar@@ est in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ ings or supermarkets : I find the super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
there is already plenty of it in our city .
one can see how many shop@@ shop can be found here - some have been here for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a decent weekend in the weekend , it is all the more important that we will at least receive the market hall . &quot;
&quot; for after all , the goods offered there are fresh , is mainly offered directly from the producer and is in@@ definitely inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as one sees , shop@@ pers will be stored in a shopping center only of larger companies because the dor@@ m are often not portable for a ret@@ ailer . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special grocery stores there is almost no more and what exists of it still will disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a mall with a mark@@ eth@@ all fits not together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where is the peasant hall at the construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit @-@ gallery is actually coming .
&quot; or do it already create the g@@ pen@@ st bit gallery in advance , all transactions made from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which stands empty , also needs no one . &quot;
&quot; in my view , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a farmer &apos;s market it was thanks to the w@@ ahn@@ sin@@ nig many - like I find - point@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place anymore .
&quot; when the peasant &apos;s hall is broken , another piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ compar@@ ably equal - the on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ sw@@ abs and hair pieces created by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth where the former secrets of intelligence analy@@ st took up a 35 years of prison sentence on the website Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on 2nd August , is a Bec@@ oming res@@ embl@@ ance ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline has been transformed in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ gres@@ sing and ground@@ breaking disco@@ s , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorithms of DNA that was created by Mann@@ ing was created and made out of the 30 portraits , such as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the in@@ dur@@ ations of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also to the identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already been openly committed since their pu@@ ber@@ ty on the identification as a woman , was sentenced to 20 charges against Spi@@ on@@ ag@@ eg@@ es@@ etz , computer therapy and theft . &quot;
&quot; in prison her image was suppres@@ sed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ ined , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing visi@@ bly sits un@@ well on a cock@@ pit and a plat@@ in@@ bl@@ onde per@@ ch - with which she was associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came just about the great success of their 2012 project &apos; stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
&quot; in this produced the artist portraits of stran@@ gers from for@@ ens@@ an arti@@ facts like cigarette @-@ mu@@ te and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um , in extrac@@ ted the DNA from the waste to create a picture of how these people might look . &quot;
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a Tim@@ et@@ ree .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press show of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea , asking her if they wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated mo@@ use were reported at un@@ equal bri@@ eff@@ ec@@ onds which in the course of two years have ex@@ change@@ able several letters .
&quot; she even ph@@ oned a shot of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ res@@ sed Images , &quot; which would fores@@ ee a future where the President ruled the verdi@@ ct and was able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days , after the book was published , Mann@@ ing release was calling for seven brutal years in a military force in K@@ ansas , was a welcome type of happy @-@ meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition ( s ) and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tru@@ mp leads a war against inform@@ ants from the government and against trans@@ gender troops in order to find new , twe@@ eter ways to fix the rigi@@ d activ@@ ations that he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about a strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen to happen from a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the Galerie suppres@@ sed artistic statement , Mann@@ ing called for the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in her family name ( the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in her family name ) an end of the automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation could have been the basis of gender , race , sexuality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ fü@@ ß@@ ler of Cs and GS and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed , to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ide after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , as surprisingly similar , at least in biological way we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully bring about who we are and how openly genetic data are taking care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell as many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is one page from the above mentioned Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle . &quot;
she shows Mann@@ ing how she appears with a fre@@ iz@@ pre@@ ch@@ phone in his hand from the discipline in the United States such as King Kong .
&quot; if they put your speech , they have won , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so , never mind the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly out of a letter that she wrote me , &quot; said the artist , who sal@@ ute from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still refer to go@@ os@@ sy when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the show personally - as it should be fores@@ een in the com@@ ic book , but if it should do it , then it will be welcomed in the center of the room from the masks , stretching from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ acr@@ um as hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also deliber@@ ated , like everything in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic h@@ ap@@ log@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd of crowd , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg told the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement , which formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which also arose behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of University of North@@ western and a employee of Oxford University of Oxford because of living
&quot; a nation@@ wide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and a staff at the University of Oxford , who were considered to be a susp@@ ect after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago had fatal injuries . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) warran@@ t for murder , due to their alleged participation in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Cook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died . &quot;
&quot; one of the National Authority of Chicago published a collaborative warning system , that the Lei@@ che was discovered on 27 July . &quot;
&quot; officials got a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injury to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still explained on the site of the action for dead , and det@@ ective investigate the stal@@ ks as a murder , while the police actively seeks after the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
La@@ them has been extraordinary Professor for Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ h , the vice @-@ president for university ties , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ m@@ them now be in ur@@ ur@@ ably and ruled out of the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal case that is investigated by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University enters into this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement , that &quot; we are in contact with the police in UK and ready to help the US investig@@ ators on any imagin@@ ative way . &quot;
&quot; the statement was added that War@@ r@@ ens were sho@@ cked , and want he himself . &quot;
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the Police Office of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said , he urge the susp@@ ects to place the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them to loc@@ alize , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building holder of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip that had just happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as a very cruel .
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , it is unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren in the building were .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline , and the background of the victim , and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible home incident . &quot;
&quot; we will complete the W@@ ada car plan in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vi@@ ei@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
&quot; the Russian Vi@@ ei@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said , it will not last long before the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing Agency ( W@@ ada ) for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) . &quot;
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ USA@@ DA has received the right , in cooperation with Ukrain ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ ada @-@ roadmap was updated in this regard , &quot; stated Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the timetable of the W@@ ada to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ replacement of R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the Organization &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause Russia an occasion . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria listed in the list is noted , however , that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have reported the reported results of affected research by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly accept subsidi@@ zed D@@ op@@ ings in Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the matter said mut@@ ko : &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has an error . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; there were no state programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with Russian sales point of sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov was problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody has before to accept this report uncondi@@ tionally , &quot; he added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded in the course of dop@@ ing Sk@@ and@@ als from the W@@ ada of the implementation of D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls in Russia . &quot;
&quot; however , it was permitted to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the main event of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ USA@@ DA moves in the right direction . &quot;
Al@@ di s@@ ells no eggs more
this shared the company &apos;s groups .
&quot; it hand@@ els to a pure decision @-@ measure , it could continue to be presum@@ ed by no human impair@@ ment , it was in the message . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs are likely to be delivered to Al@@ di , which were neg@@ atively tested on fi@@ pr@@ on@@ il@@ hal@@ ogen@@ ated anti @-@ lact@@ ate . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency in its customers .
&quot; start @-@ ups , which will help your company to become the nearest U@@ ber &quot;
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the happiness in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys did not work .
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you spoke anonym@@ ity , some workers are not the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never Con@@ sist@@ ence and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t that operates the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce H@@ air Care Society Madison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has helped people from the outside to help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at the w@@ ax@@ ing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; through the creation and licensing of software , which allows the specific purpose of measuring the employees engagement , they allow companies to carry surveys , speci@@ fic@@ ity and demo@@ graphic groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines to address the C @-@ Suite executives and contact the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Str@@ ava and Fit@@ Bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your business ? &quot; &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools used by companies to measure employees . &quot;
&quot; she said that she had a better look at what your employees think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , there is a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most discomfort and which managers have low commitment results - so that you can sti@@ r why . &quot;
&quot; to get to know that at the top of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ ale , who has a former employee published a blog post which has spoken to be pun@@ ished for those who have spoken . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups , such as G@@ lin@@ t , this desire is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business approach . &quot;
&quot; the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance industry might possess more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion , according to the R@@ enting technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an asc@@ ending interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the ure@@ th@@ ood in Mis@@ kl@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber recently signed up as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent company lets you receive tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive responses in real time and view the warmth cards of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , with which employees can report a real conduct . &quot;
&quot; and when the main business guide is included , complaints directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the Reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that his staff treated poor@@ ly or beh@@ aves un@@ ethical , it can be costly consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cot@@ t , workers airline and peti@@ tions , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , Con@@ ver@@ cent has been installed for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policy and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she wants to submit a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company central , a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said , there was no good way to track the complaints from employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems , previously were identified by managers , who were hidden in offices in towns or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or more lou@@ der internship can be identified quicker . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 degree of view in the experience with employment &quot; , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who manages the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders in front of employment law disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; companies began to take ethics , ethics , values and employees engagement in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; soci@@ als media came to their right , &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology for monitoring the ethics , men used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t as well as Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and loaded the company with recur@@ rent fees for the use of their products . &quot;
&quot; it is a business model and an opportunity to find the agreement of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors , who have supported both start @-@ ups . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February by companies such as Sap@@ ph@@ ire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , which has raised the entire capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ itz@@ ers assured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partner and its entire funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; this investment is hardly surprising , given the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and Venture Capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that the current staff can expect more of their jobs than before . &quot;
in competitive markets such as Sili@@ con Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only bet@@ s .
the employees want the feeling that you accept and appreciated that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if the people are glad to be in a company , feel that their voices are heard and that the work that you are worthwhile , then they feel stronger commitment to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , vice president of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Employ@@ ee Experience with Link@@ ed@@ In , both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors reach uns@@ elling if their portfolio companies are well run . companies are running well if employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third parties promise , dedication and commitment to increase staff , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employees engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important .
&quot; however , the data is useless if the administrator of a business does not take any action . &quot;
&quot; in fact , if a company asks staff after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on its way . &quot;
&quot; and if the shift does not come fast enough , or not at all , can dis@@ courage the dis@@ appointments and cultiv@@ ate them . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be willing to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company to rely on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; because if you do not follow people , &quot; have you really heard ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Madison Re@@ ed , who runs every monthly employee surveys , was able to initi@@ ate measures on the same day when a problem with G@@ lin@@ t reports , so salvation . &quot;
&quot; after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees it was due to the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , capable of organizing several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ruby Tuesday , the company receives new insights on the employees , and it hopes that in the long term , this leads to a better relation of workers in a branch that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose man , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose company . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A remo@@ ves the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the bru@@ ins
it is going to be at 23 o &apos;clock as a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers are talking on one side of the new practice fields of the team on campus .
some have moved their Tri@@ c@@ oto@@ ties and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of the training manager .
&quot; for a good portion of the team , these unt@@ ings are a lunch break . &quot;
&quot; players who are to be written during the summer holidays , will return after the three @-@ hour exercise , before they return next morning at 6 : 30 pm to the Water@@ man Football Center . &quot;
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; said Bru@@ in @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players , and she actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to meet the already packed time plans of the players . &quot;
the compromise reached by the two days is more than a day when the brood at the start of the Camp@@ s almost one week after the last season postpon@@ ed and during the summer school for the first time during the during the summer school .
they shall keep in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the initial preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he ass@@ ay the band@@ ing of the N@@ CA@@ A suppor@@ tive , even if they add to the busy routes of the players another point . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous burden three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they have simply pushed it down , they plac@@ ken further , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it really is great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will finish its practices as soon as the camp is finished , as soon as the camp is finished , given the clear sight@@ se@@ ein@@ gs of its fields from an adjacent parking and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class , which has already been cl@@ ashed with feet , which will be a protective edge behind a tor@@ p@@ fo@@ sten , no easy task . &quot;
&quot; brood @-@ Player should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a dre@@ amed that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real issue , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then set up an exercise . &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not too big worry about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles on fac@@ ul@@ ations at Fak@@ ten@@ sur@@ fer from third parties and show their results among the original show , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so called F@@ ake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on its website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect the possible mis@@ responses and to send them to fac@@ tual @-@ insp@@ ectors , which may display results of the fact @-@ check out of the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main sections for so @-@ called F@@ ake news , many of which believe they have also affected the U.S. presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political theme in Europe , whereas the French voters have been floo@@ ded in May ahead of the presidential elections in May and Germany ought to be pun@@ ished for a plan , according to social media networks , if it did not manage to remove h@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook told a separate declaration in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of new facts . &quot;
&quot; besides the realization that stories of fac@@ tions @-@ insp@@ ectors parties are challenged , people want more context in order to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; Sarah Su , Product @-@ writer for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; connected item &quot; &quot; and working on other changes to his messages . &quot;
creating a com@@ ic @-@ style : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the small Scot@@ ney castle was to be seen in a squ@@ ee@@ ze music video and was scre@@ ened for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 @-@ er and 1980 @-@ er years .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years old turbul@@ ent history of its cozy seat at the Ar@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ari@@ gen Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; says he w@@ ron@@ eous . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos;s thri@@ lling the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist - Isaac L@@ enk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book by Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British library - a project which he was unexpected emoti@@ onally . &quot;
&quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ bs on the side of a letter so re@@ acted , which was written by a double @-@ ag@@ ony in the 1700 &apos;s , he says for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thum@@ b ! &quot;
&quot; and letters always come to smoke , because back then one lit up a fire because of light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is engaged with old papers , that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have been rated a little over@@ ly &quot; ) , this seems to be all too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rhodes spent his days with it , the Vic@@ t@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle to explore the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , like about mon@@ sty ru@@ gs in the walls and the bottles , which had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he walks through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landsc@@ ap@@ ing rivers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank , whis@@ key and started to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust did not get the full access since 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rhodes was a decade later , the employees started to take care of the archive which he described as &quot; hundreds of years ago in which Arist@@ ocr@@ ats did &quot; &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; books , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps that represent , who poss@@ essed : &quot; you might think that land @-@ fli@@ cts would be boring , &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a pe@@ ar to have fought the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let all go their way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se in the British history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man who built the newly built castle in order to join the peasant status of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a recording of a tur@@ mo@@ il that appeared in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; K@@ night@@ ly family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rhodes . &quot;
&quot; the farmer started in this area and I thought , an u@@ prising was a good start . &quot;
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are stuck in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who told the history of the Jes@@ u@@ it pat@@ rons , who hid the family of Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , represented by the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , he filled up his own funeral ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was du@@ g ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be a cro@@ ok , over and over again debt and spend money for things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of the A@@ rah@@ al men prov@@ oked their debt crises , by having rich old women married - I imagine it as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise oni@@ bility . &quot;
after the end of his en@@ rol@@ ment in the castle Rhodes is still looking for other unique scre@@ ams .
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about El@@ em@@ än@@ ki behind it , the grounds of a san@@ at@@ orio were returned from the early 20th century , which has since been returned from nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ en@@ dorf
with the contrac@@ eption of the 301 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle has started the town of Bad Honnef on Friday their campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
&quot; until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his Marketing Team want to keep the logo and the slogan . &quot;
at the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Graf@@ en@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too good for us .
or ? &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters to the Rh@@ en@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; &quot; write them on their yesterday . &quot;
yet we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that as a bad Hon@@ our citizen , we know very well about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; with the action it is more than &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says furthermore . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate an all@@ evi@@ ating promise , one that gives the city an un@@ mistak@@ able every single person . &quot;
&quot; finally , she stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
a middle five @-@ dig@@ it amount will be the town of Bad Honnef her new umbrella @-@ brand and the campaign costs .
military re@@ forming in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan fear of the army
every year in the beginning of August in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on Pen@@ sion@@ ings and evalu@@ ations in the officer &apos; officer .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal operation .
&quot; but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces , a year after the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; the meeting was held no more in the building of the Staff College , as formerly , but in the National @-@ President of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the presidency of the government the five dep@@ uty re@@ agents , as well as the minister of defense , home affairs , justice and foreign affairs . &quot;
these were the civilians in the Y@@ as in the Over@@ speed .
the government moves to the military in the military .
&quot; toward Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remained in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y were dism@@ issed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed Cou@@ p , Erdo@@ gan 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als has been fired . &quot;
more than 10.000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged compounds for the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who saw Erdo@@ gan as wire conductor of the coup .
&quot; for 4@@ 86 people who were immediately participating in the coup attempt , will be in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had the progress of the revolution as a &quot; God gift &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to fully clean the armed forces . &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan the army really under control ?
&quot; in late February the newspaper &quot; &quot; Hürriyet &quot; &quot; published an article with the title &quot; &quot; un@@ eas@@ iness in the military @-@ headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general rule there are concerns over the increasing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; of the army , which manifes@@ ts itself among other things in the abolition of the head@@ sc@@ arf ban for sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the large @-@ pur@@ pos@@ eful in the army and the security guards goes on any rate .
&quot; mid July Erdo@@ gan by decre@@ e another 73@@ 95 State courses , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 54@@ 6 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed like Erdo@@ gan run the military .
the gener@@ als painted earlier than the actual men of the country .
thri@@ ce put@@ ted them under appeal to their role as guar@@ di@@ ans of the world of sec@@ ular state .
&quot; after his election in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan returns the power of the military &apos;s step by step , not least among the appeal against the reforms of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan &apos;s support targeted by the armed forces of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; V@@ oc@@ al Europe &quot; , a named named officer , who sought after the coup attempt out of fear of persecution abroad asylum , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; in a few years . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such a development could not leave the Nato . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there is doubt that there is a doubt in the alliance with the Turkish army in question . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington does not change the Green Card rules
&quot; there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , c@@ ited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he sees to lower the legal immigrants on 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining visa for a temporary work permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill must be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by the US will change the way the citizens from other countries of Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of chains and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that our economy will get good , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , c@@ ited by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to use route for Rac@@ eway
over the past few months over the future of the race boo@@ klet has been gone - now it is supposed to go quite fast .
&quot; even before the end of the year , on the mar@@ gins , on which the tourist train stops , will be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the racing flight @-@ term in the long term , the information of the Ministry of Health was to start working on the circuit in this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order and order the track from Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country does not know the country , especially for tourism , &quot; stated traffic @-@ secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the costs for over@@ hau@@ ling the line has about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country goes 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on the shuttle will also be ordered in the future by the country , will currently be finally matched . &quot;
the ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen Bahn as an operator can already agree on the technical details .
&quot; this is the timetable which used vehicles and quality standards , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
the racing @-@ bug @-@ shuttle will be regular on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g Shuttle is a particularly popular railway connection between stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; over the past few months , the course of a pilot farm has been tested , whether the circuit is used by enough people to order it again in the future . &quot;
the route is also very colorful in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it would not be crazy about 2017 , a new report comes about technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , in fact . &quot;
sex @-@ robots are currently a great thing .
recently the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) released a report on the development of sex robots from the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ti@@ fied professor for robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start to take her rise seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye @-@ color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el . &quot;
&quot; people are talking about them , but the companies provide plenty of them and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key in the release of his new report . &quot;
&quot; modern sex doll@@ s have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a Sili@@ cone , which feels warm - with consciously human reactions made by artificial intelligence . &quot;
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to his con@@ vic@@ tions , &quot; &quot; and select everything from the eye @-@ color of the robot to the type or colour of its f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it is more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; which would be a st@@ eppe @-@ wife of progressive . &quot;
modern sex doll@@ s have developed into robots with a si@@ lic@@ on skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x @-@ robot allows for example to adapt its users to its robots to the characteristics that they will be appealing , such as rel@@ ieve . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the &quot; True Comp@@ ani@@ on developed Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex @-@ robots with pre @-@ programmed personalities as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conv@@ eys the impression of sh@@ ud@@ der and &quot; Wild Wendy &quot; with a &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; black@@ up the website of True Comp@@ ani@@ on . &quot;
&quot; so may they like what you like , and she does not like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
she has over the course of the day her m@@ oods - really like real people !
&quot; it may be tired , fixed on con@@ dens@@ ation or it can be &quot; &quot; in mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in the rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ ordinate female properties , taking a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( said here : refu@@ ge ) Far@@ rah , be@@ un@@ quiet one most . &quot;
&quot; on his website true Comp@@ ani@@ on Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibration , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibration , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a feeling of sex or just just another shy . &quot;
their origins and their increasing refin@@ ement show some dark and deeper insight in our culture to retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as an optional addition .
&quot; most men will of course have no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R witnessed their increasing popularity , they nevertheless remain provisional at the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what out of the edge @-@ zones can be le@@ ased , in terms of the spirit of time we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not strange or bel@@ ated , until they give the free market the permission . &quot;
&quot; there is however a certain over@@ cutting that these highly developed sex robots occur at a time when the rights of women are threatened throughout the world , in which there is a president in the White House , who has served to have sexually off@@ ences . &quot;
the most terrible aspect of the television series &apos; The hand@@ maid &apos;s Tales &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images that en@@ su@@ ed body and the engra@@ ved eyes but how realistic this vision works .
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
&quot; the goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star proportions ) . &quot;
your buil@@ ders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , to the point when it comes to its &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots represent no real women . &quot;
you can not separate yourself from your companion or simply going away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background history , nothing that could distur@@ b on independence or anything that could inter@@ fere with the fantasy of total submission . &quot;
otherwise expressed : they are counter@@ f@@ arious slaves .
or to express it in the brief@@ ing of 2017 : maid
Tru@@ mp@@ s big performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the s@@ laughter of a healthy life .
&quot; it has become a transi@@ ent of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions , which have pol@@ arized the U.S. constitu@@ encies , also have families in the small format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ fest , there were newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp &apos;s relatives . &quot;
we all ph@@ ased ourselves to put down our filter@@ ing brack@@ et .
&quot; this has been less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s , families . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my cous@@ ine , a left @-@ oriented poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been engaged in the republi@@ cans in our family , has visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the Republi@@ can relationship , with which she had fought for decades , and quite peculi@@ ar on the same side . &quot;
&quot; for the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in a further connection that this also brings considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the resulting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right . &quot;
&quot; if we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gr@@ ading possibility that we will no longer engage in any day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is a still start@@ led long @-@ time scenario , in which Tru@@ mp Republi@@ can of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; that suddenly appear in comparison to its standards than in the term of denial . &quot;
&quot; I find myself today from an active no@@ stalgia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s com@@ ic version of the mad@@ od@@ ach - the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ach , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement saw ) - both compared to Tru@@ mp in fact one as very mild off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; when Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the republi@@ cans must be only healthy in order to qualify as in@@ estim@@ able enhancement . &quot;
&quot; as my cous@@ in in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the Car@@ us@@ ells of New York &apos;s Park@@ ings , and the best three dollars you need to spend in town if you do not need caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are huge , the fiber@@ glass design on the central cylinder - all cl@@ owns are cris@@ p and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the clim@@ atic music conv@@ eys this in a decent way . &quot;
&quot; so many stere@@ otypes of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty years later , and I still didn &apos;t know quite about the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is no Swiss Cottage - the themes @-@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage counts not - but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park @-@ carousel is still a strange experience , as here two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ er years can go on it and have all a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could rate the carousel round , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked him afterwards . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I managed to pull my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to score the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the counter . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ ing of what is actually a neutral exchange , but also exercises pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation where none is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ olog@@ ised , while I get tired the experience to suff@@ ice my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar pist@@ ori@@ us with breast @-@ pain moved from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us have left the prison for a hospital .
&quot; last year , he was transferred to hospital because of the treatment of cuts to his crafts , which he suffered the pr@@ isons according to a case in his cell . &quot;
G@@ ori@@ us was condemned because of murder after an appeal of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first leg .
he married Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of the Valent@@ ine Day 2013 by removing them several times by a door of the toilet cass@@ ette in his house in Pre@@ tor@@ ia on them .
Pist@@ o@@ us suggested that he held his girlfriend for a night@@ ly inv@@ aders who hid himself in the cabin .
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their purpose , this time to appeal against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say it is too indul@@ g@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the National Criminal Authority , said that they will raise an objection on the Supreme Court of South Africa and the claim could be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there are no penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold is a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ er schools , the neighborhoods of F@@ utzen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were released into the holidays and in the continuing schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the det@@ ach@@ ers will go to the gram@@ mar school , four to the real school . &quot;
Schul@@ leit@@ ner Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .
&quot; as a symbol for school dism@@ iss@@ al , the 29 students of the four classes were led by Sophia Schum@@ acher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des a young eag@@ le , who grows in the h@@ ew@@ erhof , but then released into the freedom . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the m@@ under@@ e Sch@@ ar conducted a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in Ch@@ ick@@ erhof . &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold was found a strange egg , and let it brood by his chicken . &quot;
instead of a chicken ch@@ ick there came a little eag@@ le .
&quot; but the hope to make out of him a chicken , cutting himself , the eag@@ le spread on a high mountain up its wings and s@@ lap . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , the classes pointed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank a chicken dance . &quot;
&quot; the chicken danced with the young go@@ ers , the cylin@@ ders , around the w@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; the eag@@ le stand for the integration , said Schul@@ leit@@ ner Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
the young is differently than the other young animals ( chic@@ ks ) but were included .
he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
they wish each neighborhood thri@@ lling that he feels accepted in his new school .
&quot; thanks to the colleagues , the former school conductor Michael Müller , who again cat@@ ching again at school springs , and the parents &apos; representatives . &quot;
the kitchen time is now over ; the teacher explained Sophia Schum@@ acher .
&quot; they let their students learn lessons very much after two years , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students left a song of summer@@ time and holiday season . &quot;
this was a great pleasure in the children .
&quot; for the new year of school , eight initial results are already registered . &quot;
two Bulgar@@ s arrested by illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulgar@@ s were quoted on account of illegal Camp@@ ings in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quotes by television , with . &quot;

&quot; at the Diesel @-@ Summit BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software updates are offered for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they are intended to improve the emissions behaviour of cars of emissions from 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ t .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from the ACE Auto Club Europe provides ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents :
is the new action compul@@ sory ?
&quot; no , the tr@@ aded software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the binding updates previously only apply to the vehicles , the Schum@@ an software , &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
their retro@@ fit has arranged the drive @-@ drive ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the makers have announced a fast implementation in the coming months , but not an exact date . &quot;
Daim@@ ler has notified of writing every person .
&quot; if there is any inspection , it will be done in the framework . &quot;
how long does the revolution lead to a total ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the depend on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
because we have seen volunte@@ ered the auto @-@ actors on the subject environment so far .
how long will the update take ?
the shifting itself could last only three to four hours in the garage .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ace reveals to wait .
&quot; probably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
does a massive price of Euro @-@ 4 @-@ cars ?
the ACE feared that .
&quot; but even in the regions , where driver is dro@@ wn . &quot;
so far there is no value for older diesel in the rural area so far .
&quot; ace reveals , with a sale still to wait . &quot;
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ am@@ orous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises to be political .
one of the winners does not want to come - made of protest .
ll cool J ( 49 ) gets first Rap@@ by one of the awards ceremony of the renowned Kennedy Center .
&quot; in this year , Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) , and the choreo@@ grapher Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV @-@ Producer Norman LE@@ AR ( 95 ) . &quot;
handed over the awards at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , U.S. president Donald Tru@@ mp will hold a reception and participate with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;
the winners with progressive TV series announced LE@@ AR PEO@@ PL@@ E announced that this is why participating in the g@@ ala .
&quot; the &quot; New York Times &quot; said : &quot; &quot; this Presidency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even to ent@@ ail even the means - and that deb@@ ited me . &quot;
the 59 @-@ year Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will use the conversation with Tru@@ mp to cl@@ ing their point of view .
this after the former president John F. Kennedy declared Kennedy @-@ Centre is the largest resort in the U.S. capital .
&quot; among the previous winners are Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city worth living
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , lasts for the coming year in R@@ ente . &quot;
the passage is already written and suitable applicants are r@@ ar .
since 31 years is W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work still makes him great fun as he conv@@ eys in the Pres@@ seg@@ es@@ prä@@ ch .
&quot; it reports of diversi@@ fied , but also challenging tasks that are waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we have no application to lead the application profile . &quot;
the city looks for the night@@ ly time an architect or buil@@ ders .
this is the case that the regular periods of notice will still be enough time for a development .
&quot; because Has@@ l@@ ach acts for the administration of the administrative community as sub @-@ law , the applicant has to show the corresponding sections . &quot;
because this function wants to retain the city in any case .
&quot; if they cannot perform any more , then the citizen would have to go to advice until Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but civil proximity is the city and itself important , says W@@ acker , who is about a good working atmosphere , as well as a good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; over 30 years in the office , some of the major projects have accumulated while looking back to pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city of livel@@ i@@ hood , &quot; he is sure about the building office and its employees . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as , as well as the low@@ land @-@ park @-@ car park are around . &quot;
the Kin@@ zig@@ brücke bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium of the stadium is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter is about 1.5 million euros to be@@ ech with some 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we are doing right . &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; classi@@ cally , for a city master great room . &quot;
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building and gar@@ dener could be responded to many of it quite flexible .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; W@@ acker , and the design of the green zones is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as an ensemble stands under monument protection , it is important to have an eye on what kind of rec@@ oll@@ ing , when new buildings are approved , empha@@ sizes the depart@@ ing Stadt@@ bau@@ meister . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a client , &quot; in the end everything goes here about my table . &quot;
&quot; in providing care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been present for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep @-@ building ) has been present for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor remains long , wishes are W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to really identify and stay with the place . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good operation , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; who wants to be@@ er@@ b Roland W@@ acker , should be responsible for information about the city of Has@@ l@@ ach , as a diploma manager or Bachelor with expert orientation architecture and have good knowledge in the areas of construction and construction planning . &quot;
&quot; the municipal office sub@@ str@@ ate high @-@ quality and deep @-@ construction , construction planning , gr@@ aded @-@ matters , management of urban coupl@@ ings , residential building , with construction and city @-@ rights , including monument protection , and reason@@ ing protection . &quot;
bicycle on lines throw : Süd@@ ground rack closed
&quot; according to the police , the far @-@ known perpet@@ r@@ ator had thrown the blue bicycle from the rail@@ road leadership in the field of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) . &quot;
these have been so strongly damaged during the her@@ b@@ ah@@ ling of freight pass .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and are searching for them since the night hours .
near the scene we have been watching a pink sco@@ oters and a bike @-@ rider .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ en@@ stre@@ ich , &quot; said O@@ BB @-@ Spe@@ aker Christoph Pos@@ ch to APA . &quot;
the or the perpet@@ rators brought themselves into great danger and also thre@@ aten traffic traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage on the Lo@@ k and the plant , as well as the delay range and the costs of rail replacement traffic we could also return to the perpet@@ rators of rail customers . &quot;
&quot; overall , from a &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; sum , the spokes@@ man said . &quot;
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south @-@ trail could be guided without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; almost ten persons of persons were posted on Friday morning , two of them dr@@ au@@ ght . &quot;
&quot; Gü@@ ter@@ ies did not fell out , but they had delay . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ Spe@@ aker Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced around 200 metres in the upper instructions .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were likewise damaged .
&quot; red meat , milk products and chocolate could help , IB@@ D ( inflammation ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your diges@@ tive system like a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study claims the exact opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based prot@@ ector and dairy products , could all@@ evi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million and in the U.@@ K. 30@@ 0.000 , causing stomach up@@ tions and paraly@@ sis , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness . &quot;
&quot; while those affected are usually come to avoid meat and dairy products to rel@@ ieve their symptoms , researchers found an essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by proteins to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant diges@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; the leading researchers , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the intest@@ ines declared to ensure that dam@@ aging micro@@ bes that hide in the food , do not enter into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells , which are capable of compens@@ ate inflammation , are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without dam@@ aging tissues . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in a inflammatory deficit . &quot;
&quot; in experiments , I found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice occurs to carry out a specific bacter@@ ium in its entry . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins to dis@@ solve the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial infection - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ tery - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an an tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet caused toler@@ ant , less inflammatory intestinal flu@@ ids , if the same system is also with people . &quot;
&quot; the Post@@ do@@ kt@@ or@@ and@@ in Dr. Luisa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , but found that a group of study tastes carried such cells , but a different group of the same tribe but which was not divided . &quot;
&quot; it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and mushrooms which usually live in the stomach astro @-@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of the mice have been spot@@ ted DNA sequ@@ entially and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells , but without them def@@ ective with the mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment so that they mis@@ ed a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ om and they did not developed this kind of immune cells , and they were created by L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria carried out on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i left the liquid hand and then transferred small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells that have been isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ able cells .
&quot; when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism that is known as in@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers re@@ doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the for@@ age of the mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ ical values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice , and that most of us protect ourselves in our stomach @-@ Int@@ est@@ inal tractors . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ off@@ ences from L. reu@@ ter@@ i the cells can develop in people as with mice , but defects in G@@ enen in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with infl@@ amed bo@@ iling . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , since these cells are inflammation towards the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ ical levels in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to a expansion of this population .
&quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic is a &quot; genius &quot; committed
&quot; at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believe Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening his debut against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pounds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday begins , and impressive in the Hal@@ ter &apos;s role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira . &quot;
&quot; however , MAT@@ IC had been excluded from the preparation @-@ Asian tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had to improve that he had to improve before the Premier League period . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
&quot; we will help him , earlier than later ready to be . &quot;
&quot; besides M@@ atic start@@ led also Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in Avi@@ va stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho its start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season formal . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho added three more novel@@ ty , but he insi@@ sted that the Club has already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of its four priority res@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; three of four of them , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given great difficulty . &quot;
Boeing &quot; &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. Air@@ plane Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
&quot; the pil@@ ots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state Washington , the drawing began however in Marqu@@ ette in US @-@ state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers across the USA , these are several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the rad@@ ar shi@@ el@@ ding the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole thing was a dau@@ tru@@ est for new engines .
Boeing had already taken such advertising before earlier days .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing 7@@ 87 was painted in the sky .
&quot; new low@@ chart for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind turns out : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still a SPD boss , S &amp; D Prime Minister before elections always with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; merely no stor@@ es@@ fire from the party central , merely not a head@@ wind from the covenant - so was the most important desire of the voting fighters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz , the party has radic@@ ally changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees of the Willy Brandt @-@ house will observe with growing reli@@ ance on the events in the SPD @-@ governed national capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , with return wind was not even described in the approach . &quot;
they were ra@@ inf@@ all .
and indeed one after the other .
the Con@@ federation &apos;s CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this once again shows more : red @-@ green simply cannot be sure , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber , the Edit@@ ing network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
the surprising m@@ illing of the Gre@@ ens suffered by the Gre@@ ens of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) over@@ thrown into a difficult crisis .
&quot; five months before the European election , its red @-@ green coalition makes its red @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green @-@ President Michael Kell@@ ner has called upon to return to the Gre@@ ens of Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ sische Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ sische Green @-@ MEP El@@ ke T@@ ets to return to its mandate .
the transition to CD@@ U means a clear understanding of the elect@@ or@@ ate .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ alle must immediately return its mandate , &quot; said the Federal Minister leader and campaign for the Gre@@ ens of the Bundestag ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; that may , however , must not be true , &quot; sig@@ h a SPD vote , as on Friday morning , the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ bot@@ s will be the party central . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister from Lower Saxony , stands after crossing the green Members El@@ ke T@@ Mid@@ west to the CD@@ U without its own government . &quot;
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the mi@@ ere began with the un@@ expect@@ edly sharp defeat at the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , so@@ othing the com@@ rade . &quot;
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ West@@ p@@ hal@@ ia will be everything else .
this became clear - and it became much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the Tauern , the Düsseldorf @-@ side @-@ side of the party is smooth . &quot;
te@@ di@@ ous appe@@ aled the comrades in the weeks after that time .
&quot; then when they had just had a new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with it came the next precip@@ itation .
&quot; Mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD country St@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus due to that weekend , because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned . &quot;
and because he has done so pretty much in crisis communication after that which you could do wrong .
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z fights for its political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW emissions and his role in the Supervisory Board , the Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ sische Prime Minister has already been in criticism for a long time . &quot;
Mi@@ ese frag@@ ments were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely , Wei@@ l was getting stronger in the past weeks more and more strongly , in the Bund of Ak@@ z@@ ente . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the former citizens of Hanover , Germany , has yet to expand its power in Berlin , but did not remain hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they let him give him a stabil@@ isation of the party by Wei@@ l .
&quot; well , the exact opposite could enter . &quot;
&quot; however , Wei@@ l meets the bi@@ parti@@ san , in principle no fault . &quot;
and Schulz did not at all .
sometimes the comrades make efforts to keep their own ranks are closed .
&quot; your anger are directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the ab@@ err@@ atic parliament@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , such as wife T@@ ails puts her own career over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , Chief of the Party left in the SPD parliamentary group , the Edit@@ ing network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; MS T@@ west has not been elected to the parliament for her person as a director , but to the national list of Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens in the Parliament , so the Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ sische MP continued . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that they return their mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD parliamentary group &quot; &quot; lam@@ ents a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the constitu@@ encies pl@@ ague four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l to the prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ sische SPD as top candidate in the elections , the R@@ N@@ D . &quot;
&quot; now , the personal career progression of a future CD@@ U S MEP , the W@@ ah@@ er result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called for the background to clear up .
I want to know if there has been more or has given it further commitment to the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
sponsors for Local III
&quot; who wants to be gentle in the years , can get up @-@ to @-@ date support from the country . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives st@@ eg city development on Wednesday in delicate . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler was once again looking back on the previous events . &quot;
since 1991 it has been included in sensitive sanitary areas .
&quot; back then , in the re@@ development area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg , took over two thirds of the funding . &quot;
&quot; in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant from 2005 was still at 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous pas@@ times are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the interior development , and not just tap into new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4th , I received the information on April 4th , Karlsruhe , that there will be a recovery area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount amounts to 833 Euro , of which would be 500 000 euros from the country , the rest of the community . &quot;
how is a recovery area now ?
&quot; I will continue to examine as Sch@@ in@@ dler further , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; however , it also plays a role as to play in the planned area at all interest . &quot;
&quot; if required , the territory may then also move again . &quot;
&quot; the pier on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; the basement presented the contents of the federal government program &quot; Social @-@ Program &quot; , &quot; in which framework the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the programme are the re@@ vit@@ alization of internal capitals , improving living and working conditions and maintaining the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would go objective , which means per plot . &quot;
the renovation area would then finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the author@@ is@@ ation period for funding has been ongoing since 1 January 2017 and 30 April 2017 .
&quot; until September this year , however , would only once again run the inventory , as part of which to fill out a questionn@@ aire to fill out a questionn@@ aire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December the pro@@ posi@@ tional box should be made , so that the coming year can be started with the renov@@ ations . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann stated that every Comm@@ une had the alleged to carry out tests .
it is about to evaluate and decide the urban @-@ defense ab@@ norm@@ alities and to decide when re@@ configured and to what extent .
it is also included for the respective property as well as a retro@@ fit in the basic book .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come once again and get a picture of the situation .
Got@@ zel stressed , a key success factor for the project may be the participation of those involved . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I will give us questionn@@ aires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and be filled out till the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; building and property bow &quot; , &quot; which is among other things about the building state and the renovation . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; information on the size , distribution and residents of a living room can be made . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; factory arch &quot; &quot; is only to fill if in the building business areas are operated . &quot;
&quot; however , to note , Got@@ zel pointed out that a more fulfilling questionn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; moreover , new construction measures are not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
Sch@@ in@@ dler stressed that the distribution of the funds after the &quot; Wind@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; work - who first comes , mah@@ ile first . &quot;
&quot; you could not reserve the convey@@ ors for later &quot; &quot; reserve . &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Local II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a re@@ modelling &quot; &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bri@@ tish invent@@ ors uses himself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in home and car
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that it opens his door@@ step to enter his office and even start with a hand@@ lers . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had impl@@ anted the tiny chip between Dau@@ men and for@@ ef@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ teamwork . &quot;
&quot; he has worked together with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ a@@ es@@ thesi@@ sts in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the impl@@ ant procedure is carried out according to medical standard . &quot;
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs impl@@ anted micro@@ chip and only takes 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change castles in houses and cars that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per castle . &quot;
&quot; the married father from one has now built both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising cost of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , a marine helic@@ opter for an event to fly for an event that generates American production last month , tax pay@@ ers according to the specifications of the military that were left to the T@@ IME magazine as up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , the heart of the event was on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and leading officials from the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the helic@@ opter was made in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the military office in the White House demanded the presence of the helic@@ opter in a frag@@ mentary form or F@@ RA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helic@@ opter on the South La@@ wn landed , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ ic@@ opter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helic@@ opter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted to be aware of this because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the com@@ mander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the dep@@ uty prime minister of aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helic@@ opter met at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock in the morning , and until the lawn was vac@@ ated until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that , if the departure from the White House should be del@@ ayed , due to the restriction of the hours a second team needed for the flight . &quot;
the original flight place was during the event at the helic@@ opter while the safety son@@ al of unity stayed during the time on the ground on the ground .
&quot; from the records provided by the T@@ IME , it was not clear whether a second flight reservation was required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act has issued federal states to use public ownership for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event inj@@ ure the determination .
&quot; a question we created , was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; answered the dep@@ uty com@@ mander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an impetus to reform of the public sector reform that was underway in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to contain the government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the plane , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is of political advantageous purposes is hardly any new phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; presidents are oblig@@ ated to use them for the journey .
&quot; but their use only for a photo @-@ op request , is unusual . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp Com@@ pletion in February an investigation by the background of his first campaign fee in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ services , and his Twitter account is full of announ@@ cements that character@@ ize the use of the presidential plane by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; the dep@@ uty secretary of the White House , Lin@@ d@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 @-@ occup@@ ations often lead to training trips in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn by , to reduce the US President in the White House with conc@@ ise Zen@@ timet@@ res . &quot;
&quot; as a Tru@@ mp in early July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led in the White House 58 exercises . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event was en@@ umer@@ ated at the training needs of flight payment for the month , said an official . &quot;
&quot; helic@@ opter units have additionally spent 11 hours on this day for &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential versions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers were the burden for none of the other re@@ pro@@ ps , presented at the event . &quot;
a spokes@@ person from Si@@ kor@@ sky said the company was not involved in providing the helic@@ opter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not hold bud@@ get@@ ary awards for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the disp@@ atch of the U.S. Department of Defence for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D suspension is valid for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however 24.@@ 380 USD per hour . &quot;
records of unity exp@@ ose the flight time of the flight as 30 minutes from the hom@@ etown of the Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Vir@@ g@@ ina .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost of running the helic@@ opter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for tax rates is most mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; this estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the quot@@ ations for DO@@ D do not contain the recruitment costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract termin@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; at this time the former spokes@@ person of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the helic@@ opter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present this week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the federal state , Connecticut are very proud of that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent upon it . &quot;
&quot; and I think like most Americans are all proud of the helic@@ op@@ ters and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to highlight that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp be@@ worked with the helic@@ opter when he entered his circuit over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the cock@@ pit of a fire@@ man . &quot;
in the White House Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and jo@@ cked with the media through his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel with the tab@@ ern@@ dor@@ fer SV .
&quot; despite even after five games , the top @-@ leader of the Second Tennis @-@ Bundes@@ liga has become the forefront of reality in the world . &quot;
the Chief of Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a more compact team , which always plays in quite similar notation . &quot;
&quot; on the rear positions , I find the team very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV all the imports from the high north .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to bet@@ s in the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strongly on the double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is as always hard for us . &quot;
&quot; you also need a good serving luck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er team for the Trip in the High North stands practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white might give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; it is the moment that the Chall@@ enger @-@ tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fr@@ ench@@ man , won &apos;t come to the Bundes@@ liga @-@ game in the Italian Bi@@ ella Ko@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) , for his first use during this season . &quot;
the Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ ill@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the White Russians An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
&quot; in Kiel , he was to be as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ l@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgi@@ ans Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; following his two victories on the past Sunday against the club on the Al@@ ster could also move to the team Má@@ té c@@ kus@@ z . &quot;
&quot; it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was in January 2016 the number one of the Jun@@ i@@ ores world tr@@ ams , not , fill someone from the trainer around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the Ka@@ der . &quot;
how America can harm the o@@ MV
truly happy Donald Tru@@ mp not when he was on Wednesday evening his signature among the law for the shar@@ pen@@ ing of sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his tor@@ ast , the law adopted , &quot; I vo@@ iced a few &quot; constitutional regulations . &quot; &quot;
&quot; also the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed against the US . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft looks ahead to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors from the domestic O@@ MV are to be financed with other European companies in the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea North Stream 2 . &quot;
the dru@@ g@@ cul@@ m is extensive .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil group . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp , even the sanctions would have to lead to life even by Executive Order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; has been viewed , who could rep@@ el the Group and which might really hurt him . &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the cal@@ i Cart@@ el is at the heart of the series of Net@@ fli@@ x .

&quot; the staff@@ s three and four were already confirmed by stre@@ aming service , the first received its first trailer and showed the latest sal@@ v@@ illi@@ s of the show . &quot;
with the third season DE@@ A has directed its attention to the richest organisation of the drug trade in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell .
&quot; led by four powerful formats , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une @-@ 500 company &quot; only with more governmental bri@@ bery and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; G@@ IL@@ BER@@ TO Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Damian Alc@@ az@@ ar ) is her head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) holds the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ epe Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;

roll back@@ wards : the city presents 46 kitchen helpful
the town organiz@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban child @-@ t@@ ages@@ deal@@ ings the clock will be turned back .
on 1 September the town of Kre@@ feld is taking over the production facilities in the urban day@@ care centres ( Kit@@ as ) is back in a self @-@ emin@@ ence .
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , dep@@ uty head in the department &quot; youth aid , this is good news : &quot; we all enjoyed very happy . &quot;
&quot; cooked continues except house : a Cat@@ erer is taking over this task and delivers fresh @-@ cooked meals . &quot;
&quot; the city operates in the Krem@@ lin area 46 nursery , in 44 , the children received a hot meal . &quot;
&quot; in the past Kit@@ a@@ Year , 28@@ 00 children at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , not only children who are served at the age of 45 hours in the K@@ ita &quot; , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the offer also applies to 35 hours of care when children until 2 pm stay .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time employees have from 1 September kitchen service : you absor@@ bing the sk@@ ate dishes , supplement them around sal@@ ads , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioned the meal individually , give the food out , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there is two @-@ foot@@ ed facilities - only decides on the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen@@ ware now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are much stronger involved , and it is simpler for the K@@ ital@@ fields easier to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
for this is also about healthy eating and cooking .
children should help to prepare the food .
the direct connection of the cooking power of the team should be sensible .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , one person who is familiar to them , and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the inf@@ ant of the K@@ ita spaces - also the task of the kitchen staff - will be settled by special cleaning personnel in the future .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has beside the quality inst@@ aller included the kitchen performance , which they turned into the cost comparison between self @-@ reg@@ ie and foreign for the city as the most economical way , it is out of the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces will be re@@ hired . &quot;
&quot; but these hours fall around 750 people in the drawing area , not so strong in weight , &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , &quot; says the UN &quot;

&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , am@@ itable head of the mission of the United Nations , said that hundreds of women will run in the provinces elections in the provinces . three women run for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly recorded voters . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in an statement . &quot;
elections can only be really representative and credi@@ ble when women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5th .
the Taliban have published threats against a choice process which coinci@@ de with the transition of international combat operations to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time passed peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next time . &quot;
Hay@@ som said a strong role for women to increase the democratic success of Afghanistan .

G@@ MB concerns about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
&quot; a trade union would like to make himself in the managers of the Bis@@ cu@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie , on the long @-@ term commitment to production at her work in Glasgow . &quot;
G@@ MB Scotland said to weigh the company on the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the factory , next to other products hob@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea cookies . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said , he has invested more than 5 million pounds over the past few years . &quot;
&quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives were &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; , &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the branch of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to express &quot; concerns , that funding for the modernisation of production lines do not drive forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we can gain no clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concerns our members deeply . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here , and the workforce focused strongly on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , a key pillar for decent employment in an area with high levels of unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of work@@ places , wage and prosperity , and in the background of the Bre@@ xit , the rising cost of life and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently an influ@@ ential production of production at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a spokes@@ man of Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; the Fili@@ ppo at T@@ oll@@ cross did not receive a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly to this as we estimate the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives in T@@ oll@@ cross which discussed some questions .
&quot; we deb@@ ated with the staff that we work like all companies engaged in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to stay competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site and fully adapted to all of our operations , the employees and their trade union organizations should be the first to learn to know this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona record three years ago before the N@@ ey@@ mar warned ?
the site of La Liga likes to rep@@ ent their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain is not given in the persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , after offering an offer of £ 189 million in order to release his free@@ wheel cl@@ aws , but they have warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has stopped the transfer window in the summer because the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ Klu@@ b is ready to break the world record for more than double the one of the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the previous season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and most pre@@ paid professional ath@@ l@@ ete of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced its way to the outside , although a source has always given its best to worry about it since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 to take care of it . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president before this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 interest in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a str@@ ingent warning for any association , who wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact her players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , so this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have an excess of this line , with the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G Middle @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that it wouldn &apos;t allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by paying some of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese is looking for the police to be witnesses .

&quot; on Thursday night , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old of Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was coming up with his VW against 19.@@ 55 clock on the B 215 of Stol@@ zen@@ au towards Le@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the det@@ ach@@ ment of Stol@@ zen@@ au , he came to him a car on his lane , so that he had to so@@ ften the right . &quot;
the tou@@ ching the tour@@ an driver the lad@@ ders .
at the passenger there was no harm .
&quot; the driver of the opposite car , a Mercedes Benz , had out@@ dated a truck and continued his trip without worrying about the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the in@@ genu@@ ity , it may be good that the Mer@@ ced@@ ar @-@ driver had not noticed the accident at all . &quot;
the police now ask for the advance of the advance and the driver of the adult experience to get in touch with the commission@@ er on Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 2060 with the commission@@ er in Stol@@ zen@@ au .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report released Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ report on the mis@@ use cases un@@ contaminated Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this thinks author and histori@@ an Michael H@@ emann .
the final report for the abuse of the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen will continue for discussion .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ nder , Spe@@ aker of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after the release opposite the German press agency , he expect from the former Reg@@ ensburger bishop and today &apos;s Car@@ dinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an excuse . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their profound regret of their own sub@@ missions or their then false assessment of the processes . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican Council &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; , &quot; however , criti@@ ci@@ zed that in the coverage of violence against the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen with &quot; &quot; double measure &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with respect to the handles in Regensburg , no @-@ doubt that it must be pun@@ ished and sh@@ ame@@ ful actions , but the &quot; degree of medi@@ al mani@@ pulation , &quot; such as the &quot; degree of medi@@ al mani@@ pulation , &quot; such as the authors of Luc@@ etta Scar@@ af@@ fia , histori@@ ography and member of the national Italian bio@@ ethics committees . &quot;
&quot; the habit , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday life experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ af@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; also Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; &quot; one likes to see the church and this is a good Fres@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; blo@@ ws a quite normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; were to be done with free children , as I was of one to be finished . &quot;
&quot; they are unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for past decades , because the world have changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with reports on the abuse of abuse , the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often emerged . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong , says author and histori@@ an Michael H@@ emann , who has dealt with R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s mem@@ or@@ ting &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( in 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; he adds the findings of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg with the explanation Ulrich Weber Weber ( in German ) ?
&quot; a total of 547 Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the early 1990s &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of vi@@ als , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ uses . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , so that the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. is used in many cases forms of physical and psych@@ ic violence . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion , the punishment for the students could also be fier@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , unlike many other accused , many victims reported the general humanity by R. , and therefore in many cases despite violence even connect positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann , why the final report for the abuse of the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger explained his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ pages report on the &quot; &quot; inci@@ dents of non @-@ clou@@ ding &quot; &quot; is a conf@@ lic@@ ting image by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , many students will highlight his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perf@@ ection@@ ist that became hand @-@ tangible when a domain was musi@@ cally no top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate as his bio@@ grapher this final report ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you read the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself rather why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger thinks about it all . &quot;
he has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted by any suspic@@ ion of counter@@ ing or co @-@ ten@@ ant in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
&quot; also , the non @-@ violence exhibition at the pres@@ ch@@ schule is outside his sphere of efficiency . &quot;
&quot; you can throw him at a time , not too late or have taken the first post@@ ures seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the dre@@ aming school , in which it worked , was conceived by practically all respon@@ dents as - as literally - &quot; rede@@ mption &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this also marks the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , an excellent record , describes it as &quot; warm &quot; , &quot; &quot; sincerely , &quot; &quot; sincerely , &quot; &quot; compet@@ ently , &quot; &quot; compet@@ ently , &quot; &quot; compet@@ ently , &quot; &quot; compet@@ ently , and &quot; &quot; always cat@@ ered with cake , bis@@ cu@@ its , and &quot; always of grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority is compl@@ ying about his perf@@ ection@@ ism and high emotion , which also led to wine @-@ brood . &quot;
&quot; he did not only kn@@ it with chairs and thre@@ w the k@@ issed and he@@ ed to the ground , but also ear@@ nest@@ y guys in the hair or ears , he has already pointed out years ago , deeply regret and exc@@ used for it exc@@ used . &quot;
&quot; however , to his hon@@ orary capacity , however , must be told that such investigations in the frag@@ mentary time , the 1960s and 1970s were widely used , with parents as at teachers . &quot;
do you also know such a breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a world@@ ly school , a state @-@ Gymnasium . &quot;
&quot; compared to that , what is actually happening in this report , namely the genuine sexual abuse and the non@@ violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , are the subject of dre@@ ad@@ ful dre@@ ad@@ els . &quot;
one wonders whether it &apos;s not with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ kt X@@ VI@@ . to do that many media has just rus@@ hed to him .
&quot; at the Bav@@ arian Pope , many who have never understood him , still ei@@ ving him . &quot;
the truth is : the report reli@@ eved Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; in the media , related to the report was reported much about the issue of abuse on the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the Clinical Study Report as well as any connection or co @-@ action with regard to sexual abuse is put to the load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
not a single of the 67 victims of sexual transform@@ ers claims to have become familiar with the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I have never seen me to speak with my father or mother , &quot; said a subject of being for the others , &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot;
the real problem with the education of sexual abuse was and yet is that most victims are silent .
&quot; if they didn &apos;t even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral manager , who would have been certain as a colleague of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ pupils R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in view of the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a respon@@ dent student wor@@ ded it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see any case in which he would have had timely findings and could have stopped the respective offen@@ ders .
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd to suppose that in case of him ... Bub@@ ble in@@ tru@@ der or more clearly or rather open , than towards their parents , dormit@@ ory , trust , etc . &quot;
that you speak to him about sex ... - und@@ et@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; that entrust@@ ed him in advance to the students and / or their environment in advance , could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free of charge of each fellow @-@ knowledge . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it cannot be dis@@ sent to him or have brought him to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is also no reason to associate his good name with those resist@@ ent crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media was much of &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; to read with the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
the previous Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was re @-@ ass@@ aul@@ ted in the report .
does he have to live in this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the reporting everything mixed and distor@@ ted became a huge mil@@ der from sexual abuse and non@@ violence , and somewhere , in the midst of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; however , that is precisely the abuse of the report . &quot;
&quot; namely , it is to be found clean : between the pres@@ ch@@ schule and the gram@@ mar school , between sexual abuse and non@@ violence , we say once , other alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the report deals with the report from the time since 1945 , thus also from four decades , where Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the chor@@ us of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole terrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which l@@ ad of s@@ adi@@ c teachers regul@@ ates and mal@@ nour@@ ished , en@@ rolled themselves at the pres@@ ch@@ schule in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ d@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states . &quot;
&quot; but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , for he got the boy only to face when they were already on the cathedral @-@ job . &quot;
&quot; upon this , as most witnesses raised the topic of &quot; &quot; pres@@ ch@@ schule &quot; &quot; school . &quot;
&quot; one was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment , and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; conditions . &quot;
what was different in the domain of the cathedral ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was a discipline that there was no s@@ pro@@ cal violence .
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims thre@@ aten the general humanity by R. , and therefore in many cases despite violence even connect positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; so , at the most one still the throw away , to have looked . &quot;
&quot; despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported from the states at pres@@ ch@@ schule . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the events at a school , which he was not acting and responsible , ( so the witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then again at 1993 . &quot;
wear Georg R@@ atz@@ inger thinks of states consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the domain name , which the report even re@@ produced . &quot;
&quot; in this he points to this point out , &quot; that in the pres@@ ch@@ schule I will continue to practi@@ sed the test . &quot;
&quot; already given the danger of negative media , he recommended it to progress . &quot;
&quot; of course , that was of course at a time when a legal clarity consisted in Bavaria too . &quot;
&quot; before that , they stir@@ red up in a legal gray area , like everyone of us still knows . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for him to estimate too , where the sufferers may perhaps be exagger@@ ated or dramatic , and where really the per@@ missible border had been exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but one can also not say , he had always looked there . &quot;
this is just not true .
only in 1980 the test of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria too .
prin@@ cess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is maintained yes it is unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standard at the time of time .
how do you see this ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we were talking about the &quot; &quot; pit@@ falls of the an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; thus the danger of today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the prin@@ cess has been quite right .
&quot; of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse at all times and also not for what was broken in the pres@@ ch@@ ool to ad@@ versity and violence against inno@@ cent children &apos;s disease , which goes far beyond that then practicing . &quot;
this is all quite aw@@ ful and I am glad that it is finally working .
&quot; but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for all that has nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means for discipl@@ ining and punishment , so ear@@ ing , and retreat to the hair and ears , were widely used in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as a physical punishment , he has also strictly ab@@ ide by it . &quot;
&quot; which picture of his ingeni@@ ous period has existed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
was the subject of testing also related to the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , told his perspective , since the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I do not toler@@ ate that he was a stric@@ ter Reg@@ iment . &quot;
&quot; but that must be said once again : without this perf@@ ection@@ ism , without the call of unconditional discipline , it would hardly be possible to form an institution of world tran@@ sp@@ y , true cultural ban on Europe and his musical tradition that went straight to the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cu@@ its and bond@@ women alone , one does not even make a great singer and stand before every success , right in which area , yet always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
as what kind of people do you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in their book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deep believing and heart@@ ed people , from which one can &apos;t imagine that he could just have something to do with a fly . &quot;
&quot; I am regularly coming up with , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after its Emer@@ gency , regularly contact him , read it , he read it - he is almost blind - and he treat him as a member of their family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was strictly speaking to them , so are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him today that he enriched their lives and gave them the world of music .
&quot; and that he always was a good , v@@ ending teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect , to which they still look up and who live straight . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clear : everything you ask him are the educ@@ ator methods that were then on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long been overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has an even prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; that is the bad intention , that is behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just released , reli@@ eved him . &quot;
&quot; now the bom@@ bed was born , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great service and without the outside Bavaria , and perhaps Germany would probably know the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( Germany ) , finally in peace . &quot;
