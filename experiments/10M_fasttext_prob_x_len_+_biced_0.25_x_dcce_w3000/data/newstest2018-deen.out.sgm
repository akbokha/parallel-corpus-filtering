<seg id="51">The National association for the promotion of colour-colored has issued a warning for colored men who are travelling to Missouri because of the discriminatory policy and the racist attacks of the State.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the federal state of Missouri, which should come into force until 28 August 2017, while travelling through the state requires special attention and utmost caution, since a series of fragment, racenbased pretension can occur in recent times throughout the state and here is noted," it is stated in the statement of the group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently approved law of Missouri, which makes it harder to complain, as well as the perpetrators of the state, the disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to give the travel warning, the NAACP said."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have infringements of civil rights, people happen."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are raised because of their skin color, they are merged or killed," said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency, which we haven't heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that has issued the organisation for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the Group quoted as racist accusations against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders, under questionable circumstances beginning of the year, after the state had no gasoline at the beginning of the year, and was captured by the police of Missouri in custody without a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also pointed out a recent report by Missouri's office in which it is shown that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and to inform their families, friends and employees about what might happen at Missouri," says Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People have to be prepared if there are merchants or let the relatives know that they are travelling through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded in 2015 100 times in 2015, according to the latest figures from the Assyrian reporting, the state as regards the number of such injury to the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">"the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it harder to complain a company because of housing or employment-discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACES) published before the United States adopted for Texas and Arizona, after the United States adopted immigration legislation to compensate for people because of immigration violations, which in view of ACLU for further rattle."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel documents are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but at the last time stakeholders have implemented this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Hamperation project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Weimar Decdezaun project is a success project and will be continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Paragorted Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have got a picture on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the right-grabber of the family Schwendemann, representatives of the hereditary CDU local village together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann granted first insights into his business, in which he operated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest farming, 40 milk and also housed in five apartments holiday guests."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Black-milk" "is for him the alternative marketer way for the milk of his cows, so pivot."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the holiday guests only comes registrar.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also called BLHV-Chairman of Fischerbach, he called the wheat project as an" spontaneous. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot manage such steep areas in such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green-area care for a lot of work done with the motor sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have been working here with the conditions and with the topography," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003 he took over the eleventh operation and applied these without chemical-based pesticides and fertilisers, even if there is no growth."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the wheat project, and is pleased with the Leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, the farmers would need to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">"one hope that the forestation of the plots could be moved out for quite a while." ""</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure that we have, are the people working in agriculture and make thoughts about how they bring their business further," "stressed the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often involved in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">"a total of 25 plots of eleven plots were fenced in the year 2013, a total of 25 plots."</seg>
<seg id="85">"thus, the area of entertainment amounts to 40 hectares, which will not be hosted for at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the total cost of 71 500 Euro was funded half of the Leader, a quarter carried out the municipality of Fischerbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, they fell to the farmers 12 610 euro, which they had to invest in 16,2 km of wheat."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" you do a really good job, without farmers and countryside, it does not go. "</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter Weiss stand firm," Here are the best foods produced here. "</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscaping unit (LPR) Baden-Württemberg makes it possible to support the governors of the wheat protesters.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the black race.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisites is the presence of one of the LPR signed conveying.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the enclosed area may not be slim (Hangover over 35 per cent) and has to be threatened by the performance."</seg>
<seg id="95">"at the end of 2018, at the request of eight participants with 24 pitches who would like to build up to 16 kilometers of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the area of entertainment equivalent to 35 hectares, which are equivalent to over 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime transfer is it when they begin to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans are estimating these as much as every other, therefore the carefull fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Place in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key-ideologists of the Trump regime, knew certainly what he did, when he had a symbolic axe in a hitous dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the proposals of the president to the drastic restriction on the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boots and Liberty-Imitators had gotten him over if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he laid hold of their significance, and in particular the importance that you were attributed to when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after completion of the monument, his base was added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta," I don't want to enter a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that lit the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem which you relate, which later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is knowledgeable properly, but as he formulate it, it is not really about story."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the shocking words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest people, your poor, / your overly anxious masses, who wish to breathe freely, / the elending waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "elend waste" was better to see in our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller dedicated not to literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps US.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who continued to place their words after her death on the base - did very well that they accomplished a high-political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus modified this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coups and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and exactly like Lazarus the importance of the statue changed, the people of the right wing wanted to go back for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great cry as a Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010, that the Statue of Liberty is nobody invade, but rather an early noconservatives, that bring the American flame in the umreed world:" "Lady Liberty is moving forward."</seg>
<seg id="119">It is said to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">Fackel is not supposed to enlighten the way to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">Rather unusual is Limbaugh here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely and even a question of awareness of the perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted in them, as they see from the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever wish to recognise.</seg>
<seg id="127">"your torch is not supposed to enlighten the way, but the hatred, who is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championships 2017: Neil Black lointed members of the team from Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle is reminiscent of a time when only two carrots belonged to the team of Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="130">"the power director of the athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member schottish contingent will be a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish Athleten was selected for London 2017 that starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "in Scotland" "something special develops" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom has to learn from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," said Black. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish Athlete think that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy at the corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is it is absolutely brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish Athleten are medals-candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which was voted against Sir MO Farah at the 5,000 m route, whereas Eilidh Doyle was elected by the crew to the team captains."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"their captain's speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, no matter whether they were shottish or wherever they live or exercising, went out of space and were very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling that Eiliie was natural, of course, were magnificent."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the British silver medal winner who won the 400-m hurdles in her fifth World Championships, says that it is" incredible "that 16 carrots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's greatest number of athletes at the world championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015. "</seg>
<seg id="146">"in this way, the muir-runners Muir lead the way to five British and two European records last year."</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m of rounds."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, which runs 1,500 m, is another scotte that should be observed after a great season, which should be observed in the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle reminded of her first World Championships as the only other carrot in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team's capitols says that they are" hugely proud "" on the fact that many of its compatriots do not only belong to the team but in some cases also with the medals and the finals. "</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special about the team's chapters, lies in that it was chosen by the other members of the team so it's anyway a great honor to know, but to know that my team mates voted for me and have chosen it to something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I am very proud of all the villi who belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who wish to rise to Podium."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech as captain concerns?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">"so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it, that we are back at the Olympiastadion."</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking critic on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot carry the killing of electors.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from poor media.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last long before the newspapers swallowed him because of everything from the internal policy to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">He drowned upon critique safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783 Washington said," "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led as sheep to battles."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on it to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinions on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union defendant him this week at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the stand of the governor sent the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a backlash with 'Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is just Facebook," many people said. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is surprisingly popular."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest agreement of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of its state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillfully to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his haarless head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blockade of persons who come to the side of the Governors - which is a public forum that is officially designated as officially and by employees working with public taxes - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post defended, Amelia, Amelia Chasse the acts of the Governors and argued that the blockade of comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of glasses or spammers or hasserted people that resonate online via the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are just real people who speak to their chosen leaders, a teacher, a business entrepreneur and a pastor."</seg>
<seg id="183">They all told that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane. "</seg>
<seg id="184">The parish priest the Bible in his post and appealed to the testified Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney at Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hassert but she asked to abort."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current news," wrote them in the commentary area of the news. "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I do not appreciate this idea, if a number of people is standing on the same subject, it will be disregarded by some more than a so-called collective action rather than a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the employees of the Governors were referred to as" "concentrated spam attack", "others would probably call" "caring". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook-era makes it easy to make a message, by simply blocked a critics or deleted a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is a lot of cleaner than in previous time when you have done the same that staff were sent to collect newspapers with critical wire articels, and to burn or drop protesters and to silence them."</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is just what happened digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official that criticises this to Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accents by Twitter-users who were blocked by his Twitter-Feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question occurred last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County last the First Amendment, according to US-District writer James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they called a voters of their Facebook-page."</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky was Governor Matt Moin (R) also obtained a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the moment Washington's time, the time of affordable PORTOS had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplies between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous stamp visits to his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington was an anonymous troll.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people, the pseudonyme like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius "," wrote all letters of newspapers, the Washington's decisions. "</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions which have criticized his position on the contract of amity, trade and shipping with the United Kingdom, overwhelmed his position, according to historical documents that were collected from the Online papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not put it to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreements and disagreements belong to the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means to accept that.</seg>

<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed their bags and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex at Knightsbridge in a much larger area," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">"I showed this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1323">"I have fallen in love with them, and made an offer on that day."</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square kilometer has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">"originally a one-room estate with a slaughtered layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne's storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"to this end, she commissioned the architectural and Designstudio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to make up 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over each other, so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate step in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan has to be creative thinking to release the award.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel station is rather complex," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms as they were overshot, without we had to hurry ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but the steel so well that he had the right height for the function above or down."</seg>

<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic clutshell window looks back from retrouvius via the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored Goldfurniture, silberne Akzente and Vintage Serge Mouille Lights make the style for the program."</seg>

<seg id="1341">"due to the perception of a glamourless space, the beauty of the living room may close the kitchen when it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Stamped kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">What is special about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of Ingenieurkunst went in," explains Erfan from the reinforced-reinforced MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is very important, so when you push the door very easily glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain extra 16 m ², an extra bedroom and a improved layout."</seg>

<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Stef of the White House, joining his first working day with leading employees, he presented a main problem to President Donald Trumps White House, which he wants to repay the hands of the President."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow on him - whether on paper or in briefings because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tempted to tame Trump by monitoring his media."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"president Trumps relationship with television ranges back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television was still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if Candidate Trump was upset because of a fair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were to convince," said the former election adviser Sam Nunberg in February opposite of the Politico. "</seg>

<seg id="1404">"if his team succeeded in keeping it up a number of times, who kept away from him, then their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented it that Trump checks.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"a part of the problem is that people in a White House, which brings themselves together from competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by providing Trump material that may possibly help their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Politico - quite busy with this history - reported in May about the preference of the consultants, the president for strategic reasons."</seg>
<seg id="1408">"this was an example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:"</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-officials say that Trump can react to negative press sections, especially those with shameful leaks, and that he can find out to figure out how these originates."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"exactly that happened at the end of February when someone gave a printed copy of an article by Gotnewseurs Charles C. Johnson, who described the deputy sefin Katie Walsh," the source behind a pile to be from Lecco "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of his icans, or that he has not offered a concrete evidence, or that he voiced in the past false prejudices and revoke it."</seg>
<seg id="1412">"Trump read the article and started to ask employees about Walsh, too."</seg>
<seg id="1413">"added that the damsel Stabschef Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, tried to implement a system to manage the paperwork and document the Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did this work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tempted three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as the most effective manager as a priebus, but Trump is still his impulsives Self, and his consultants still seek influence."</seg>

<seg id="1798">"Eric Chains, expert of the agricultural research institution CRIEPPAM in Provence, said:" the lavender in Provence is effectively jeopardy because the plant has been exposed to the impacts of climate change in the past couple of years and in the autumn much more. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet for their plans to cover the recent chaos in the state Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars. "</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure: you are supposed to take their children to the office, who were to leave the goal of an attack with granulates, or make them feel at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a blackboard on the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, ally."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporter to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feel."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drugs scuggler, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of the enroll of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest of rest from violence, and throughout the country the corpses are becoming involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto have taken office in December 2012. 589 stand after attacks and threats under Federal Protection and up to now, there was at least seven deaths in seven countries this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, their publisher and their inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence is felt deep, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which is located on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, bear t-shirts with glasses or his typical Panamera's face."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss about their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, Paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although 2010 was created by the German Bundesliga to edit the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee to protect journalists will only have two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of Morden, each year joined with drug wholesale and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely exposed to justice."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"with Riodoce, they still insist that to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are unstruneast and although the terrain is still a traitant."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to wasting my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know that Why do, we distrust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"in the morning of May 15, Valdez ran the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the province capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive it just a couple of blocks away, before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was shot out of his car and was shot 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - the" "twelve" "river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The guns was driving away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly free to Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But to the topic Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Zaloa has become one of the bloodiest battle fields of the country, since rivaling factions are fighting to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot at the road or that the cemetery is full of, two-story mouse-oles for drug royal, which are bigger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget for a minute that there is a state of rest, if only a cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs traders in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez has been aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, to blame that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first in February there was the publication of a interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of a rivaling cartel campaigns in the war with Guzmans."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may be annoyed the sons, those members bought every copy purchased from the issue once they have been delivered to newspaper presses."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second fault was in this, Valdez does not force to force the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country into its own safety."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues were annexed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced reporting for Noroeste, when he joined together with five colleagues for the creation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without affecting the dote problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"over time, the paper served a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising revenue."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved it to be hard to publish hard-informed investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories, which nobody else could handle."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the creation of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for their reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the committee for the protection of journalists for his courage during the persecution of Mexican drugs, where ever they lead."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up to him that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to live on," he said at the time of CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug-trade in Sinaloa" is a lifestyle, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV in the past October."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You must assume the task that you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked:" "what did you do in the face of so many Dead... why did you not say what went before?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team miss Valdez, the spawn-bird, who was like a dockworkers, the friend, who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher that knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trusted to his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now ask her: was his love of routine be his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to ask her own assumptions about how they work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it if you are dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their uncanny and runways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even at the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-keeping."</seg>
<seg id="1865">His own instinths trust.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong you stay away.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, said the publisher of the giodoce Andres Villarreal, that" smell is a sense that can be mistaken... and then the thing happened to Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, do not apply in Sinaloa, no more - just as in Tamaulipas, Guerrero, and other states where a toxic blend of lucrative smuggling floods, weak institutions and corrupt government representatives."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, suddenly had no mobiles allowed. days before was known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen reported in front of the heat from 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-floor district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen, which the governor themselves were considered not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago, since the reporter went into the mountain scenery, where the drugs were de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has built on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the Bruders of the former known boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an expedition to the State, which focused on the hometown of the Governors."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was one group that conducted in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor's office."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"reporters from public records, that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy, who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (Pri), which almost all the century conquered all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several pri-Governors were accused of corrupt cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the Reporter, to write about previous events in this restaurant, including one where the son of" El Chapo "Guzman had a military overfall."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months before, the readers would have viewed the Colombian of Valdez as the best informed source about the abduction."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"previously we had known what happened," "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "El FLACO" "because of its slim physique."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez was dedicated to the storage room for characters and stickers, dedicated to the murder of journalists, because the employees have become something that they have never expected themselves: activists from the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez turns out a few signs and went next morning to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the public prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan. "</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body has been discovered and official say, based on DNA tests that it is its."</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have become tougher in the country by writing them in organised protagonizing "SOS Press" on obedience and structures.</seg>
<seg id="1891">"this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"in a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez accused Ramirez away the authorities, journalists and bring them around because they have told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has been asked since then, that she is re-divided by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has been violated their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly called that journalists in Mexico have organised crime, organised crime and a equal society." ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" "Narco-Journalism", "he wrote that reporters will not only be killed of drugs, but also on command of politicians and security guards talking to organized crime among a ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"the media-Wächtergroup" "Articulo 19" "took over half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials in the past year."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico blessed you, because they want you keep the mouth shut," said Ramirez. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the Morde have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern boundary of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"your body was signed together with a note, which was supposedly signed by the Zetas Code" "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer-pable and earphones were beside their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have elected to close as the newspaper El Norte in northern border Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondents Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">"others continue, as it was El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its director in 2004."</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly directed to the drug card with a editorial article on the front page with the title "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have flown out of their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they are still watching the roads and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they will be hunted, as was obviously murdered by the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after the flight from VERACRUZ."</seg>

<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs using camouflage to soft the enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">At first glance it looks like a statue if a scary.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"now, researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible nose-horn of a Canadian mountain worker got so well received that experts have described it as" Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs. ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so well preserved that they could even notice that his blissful skin was of reddish brown - and they told, she would have had something from a" "uncomfortable past." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" Current Biology, "described it as" the bestos-protected dinosaurs that was ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs copies of the world. "</seg>

<seg id="1928">"his unbelievably well preserved condition has researchers, who describe it as a" really remarkable "," amazement "</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic the armored plant-eaters is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, as he was on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met on something that seemed misunderstood by the surrounding rock, and decided to look more precisely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil were discovered by him in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2.500 pounds (1.100 kg) heavy duty.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you are just a little with your eyes blinzeln, you could almost believe it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist in the Royal Tyrrell museum, where the creature is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it is seen in the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs copies, the mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this plant food is covered, although he is covered with an armor and a changing tank, probably of meat-sent dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily piped dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a paratrooper, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have been allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to soft the enemies, say experts, indicating that it is threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurier did for the first time in May and is now visible in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and it Borealopelta marked with the Museumstechnics Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the individual enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armors about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shadation, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than their underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shaded is usual, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta by far the animals living today survives."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs was captivated by enough pressure by meat-sent dinosaurs that the evolution undermining the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals, which use the conshady - think of deer, zebras or girdles - are much smaller and more hurled than loot, which signalizes that this novenerrier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong booty behaviour on a massive, strongly armored dinosaurs, how dangerous is the dinosaurs robbers of the Cretaceous." "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal by references about his life, including his conserved Darminhalted, to find out what it has eaten as its last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs died, when he died, turned into a river and driven into the sea where he sank on the back to the seabyss."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as Südflorida today, and rivers and oceans are likely much further spread than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preservative skin, but also kept in three dimensions and the original form of the animal retains." "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early chalk season.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need much imagination to use it to reconstruct it. if you're just a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it is alive."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the crayon time was a time, as giant Theropoda, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs, the earth had gone through."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions of years after Borealopelta lived, the boarmored dinosaurs was hunted by some of its frightening ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this belongs to Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was converted to the death in the ocean and in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the classy dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armaments, and is complete from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and have up to 3.000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch-long bits to ragged by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armored plant food was curved through the western Canada, until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"but the underwater reation of the dinosaurs, made its armor in exquisite detail."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"the petrified remnants of this particular specimen are so well preserved, that the hood is still hollows in the dinosaurs along the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of maintenance is as" rare as a gain in the Lotto. "</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"just one day after having arrived in New York City, one sat in St. Louis Gebal on the bed of an Airbnb apartment, which rented it and scroll through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled on someone from the high school.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year child and it is still on the street," says it there. "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, as no one was posted on her Feed the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly freed on their Timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the territory of St. Louis was thereby the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., was killed live."</seg>
<seg id="2027">"he posted an image of browns in a lively body, which was outstretched on the street and staying there for four hours."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"it is wild," I thought Ferrell. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for her and her community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She placed her cell phone in order to get back to Tweets on people at the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people who cried up, and from a man who claimed to be the father's father, who contributed a sign with the ordinance:" Ferguson police have just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">"watching a live Feed, where a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a revolt dog."</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, escaped a different policeman and cried," I will kill you... animals all kill. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," Ferrell reminded of their claim. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to and which we can call it typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt shook.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"I was angry, crying."</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a flight back and went to the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock she took her 6-year old daughter from the house of her father, and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? "in the cinemas from the 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and Protestes, of love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the perspective of man who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"when Ferrel with her daughter who carried a flyers, and a suitable crown, carried out the two a conversation, which they had countless times before this morning," on the black experience and the black state. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for it, what they believe?" "recalled what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we are now going to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year boy and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take them away," said Ferrell later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happens today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It is necessary to know and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution, and what we have to do to free to liberate ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she is personally experiencing any ecatant racism, it is not unlike the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I feel, I would give you a bad service to keep them far away."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived at Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which was held to a camp area, considered the activists on the possible noncharge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"here, Ferrell and her daughter have been affiliated with a local business holder, the lunch was made."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets and helped to pass them to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape in the herell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed after the 9th of August, she said and notices that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority student Nurses Association was and focused on eating social justice and health inequalities in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"" "I had no experience in the organization."</seg>
<seg id="2057">It all came. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met during an evening of Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-director of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted only" "document", "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"one question came to the mind:" "do you want to document or do you try to find a story that you can benefit from it?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism is nourished by countless cases of people often of white - in a community that benefited from their pain and its resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently explained in an interview:" "we heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area, which is known for its activism to raise death toll-inmates."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his engagement brought the project closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of" "Whose Streets"? "in the years after Browns shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak," said Davis. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people will be depicted, because so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on a Ferran experience - to show that it deals with the movement" not a messiah-leader, but a community, "said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participants in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"consequently, documents of" Whose Streets "show documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrer's life, as she loves himself and her wife marries."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," Ferrell said, "" said the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I have understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and the inhumanity of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrer's story repeated the role of the black-gay women in the broader black-Lives movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who have shaped the film" Blacklivesters "in social media in 2012, identify themselves as pregnant."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting in various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women need to wear the main weight of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to remark, that" the movement really is kept alive by black women and many black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it is obvious that" this is not a affirmative type of action, "the Ferrell was chosen as a heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not accidental although she was at the front line, because with a life on these crosses as a black, gay woman is so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel your energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson has long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the church and the police are still persist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is at currency for 2 ½ years due to the blockade of a highway in a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"it describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home:" a mess. ""</seg>
<seg id="2083">"still burning them to one vocals and she feels obligated to this memory, since she went three years ago in Ferguson on the road three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">"" "dream" "to" "Größenwahn" ": TV-readers are discussing about bit-gallery"</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves the people, although it is still not built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"but the idea of a shopping centre at the south-standing of the pedestrian zone, has been divides the population in advocates and opponents since the first presentation of 2009."</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold makes the issue barely one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"on our Facebook page" "Volksfreund Bitburg", "the subject is discussed."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one can say to the bit 'Gallery:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" "That would be real" "(Nicole Schaukal), comes from the other side:" "needs no human" "(Siggi Bural) or quite simply:" "Größenwahn!" "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates, build on that a gallery will move more customers to the city, of which the other businesses take advantage of fear the opponents that then the pedestrian zone."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added to this: the gallery will be carefully planned on the property, on which the peasant market hall is, in the 13 direct marketed its products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction work will be finished.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Galerie-Macher want to integrate a markethall in the new construction - and indeed for Beda-seat with possibility to sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we have been able to buy nearly weekly at the farmers market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farm to always be very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Even the butcher we have discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">"we would like to see that during and above all, after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer."</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also the same.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Gerd Densing:" "whether to commercialize the market in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the amount of rent."</seg>
<seg id="2105">This might not be exactly low in the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why shopping arest in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothes, shoes, drugings or supermarkets: I find the superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already plenty of it in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many shopshop can be found here - some have been here for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a decent weekend in the weekend, it is all the more important that we will at least receive the market hall."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"for after all, the goods offered there are fresh, is mainly offered directly from the producer and is indefinitely inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as one sees, shoppers will be stored in a shopping center only of larger companies because the dorm are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special grocery stores there is almost no more and what exists of it still will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a mall with a markethall fits not together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where is the peasant hall at the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit-gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">"or do it already create the gpenst bit gallery in advance, all transactions made from Bitburg?"</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "this will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which stands empty, also needs no one."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my view, it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farmer's market it was thanks to the wahnsinnig many - like I find - pointless construction projects in Bitburg no place anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the peasant's hall is broken, another piece of culture will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost incomparably equal - the on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-swabs and hair pieces created by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth where the former secrets of intelligence analyst took up a 35 years of prison sentence on the website WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on 2nd August, is a Becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline has been transformed in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgressing and groundbreaking discos, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithms of DNA that was created by Manning was created and made out of the 30 portraits, such as someone with these genomic data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the indurations of these interpretations - but also to the identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already been openly committed since their puberty on the identification as a woman, was sentenced to 20 charges against Spionagegesetz, computer therapy and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grained, black-white selfie, in which Manning visibly sits unwell on a cockpit and a platinblonde perch - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came just about the great success of their 2012 project 'stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this produced the artist portraits of strangers from forensan artifacts like cigarette-mute and chewing gum, in extracted the DNA from the waste to create a picture of how these people might look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a Timetree.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press show of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea, asking her if they wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated mouse were reported at unequal brieffeconds which in the course of two years have exchangeable several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"she even phoned a shot of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic" Suppressed Images, "which would foresee a future where the President ruled the verdict and was able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days, after the book was published, Manning release was calling for seven brutal years in a military force in Kansas, was a welcome type of happy-meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition (s) and Starkes, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government and against transgender troops in order to find new, tweeter ways to fix the rigid activations that he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about a strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen to happen from a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of the Galerie suppressed artistic statement, Manning called for the" "i" "in her family name (the" "i" "in her family name) an end of the automatic fragmentation, whose foundation could have been the basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandfüßler of Cs and GS and As, written in pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped, to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), as surprisingly similar, at least in biological way we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring about who we are and how openly genetic data are taking care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell as many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is one page from the above mentioned Comic-Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she appears with a freizprechphone in his hand from the discipline in the United States such as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they put your speech, they have won," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never mind the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly out of a letter that she wrote me," said the artist, who salute from Philadelphia. "</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still refer to goossy when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the show personally - as it should be foreseen in the comic book, but if it should do it, then it will be welcomed in the center of the room from the masks, stretching from their own genomic simulacrum as hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also deliberated, like everything in the exhibition until the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), in which their genetic haploggroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd of crowd," Dewey-Hagborg told the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement, which formed with Chelsea, like the movement, which also arose behind its liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2224">"when a company is found that his staff treated poorly or behaves unethical, it can be costly consequences by consumers-boycott, workers airline and petitions, said Quinlan."</seg>
<seg id="2225">"Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant-chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, Convercent has been installed for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policy and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2226">"earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she wants to submit a phone number or e-mail for the company central, a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"it was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said, there was no good way to track the complaints from employees."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"now, as the company uses Convercent, problems, previously were identified by managers, who were hidden in offices in towns or states - such as discrimination, harassment or more louder internship can be identified quicker."</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can get closer to this holistic, 360 degree of view in the experience with employment", "said Vitrano, who manages the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday."</seg>
<seg id="2230">"and we protect our shareholders in front of employment law disputes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">"companies began to take ethics, ethics, values and employees engagement in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal said Quinlan."</seg>
<seg id="2232">"but it took until the" socials media came to their right, "that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online."</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology for monitoring the ethics, men used hope as a strategy," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="2234">"both Glint as well as Convercent offer your software as a service, and loaded the company with recurrent fees for the use of their products."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"it is a business model and an opportunity to find the agreement of Venture Capital Investors, who have supported both start-ups."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"Convercent received $10 million in funding in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which has raised the entire capital to $47 million."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"Glitzers assured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partner and its entire funding to $60 million."</seg>
<seg id="2238">"this investment is hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and Venture Capital."</seg>
<seg id="2239">"there is a growing complex of research, which shows that the current staff can expect more of their jobs than before."</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high salaries and interesting projects only bets.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want the feeling that you accept and appreciated that you give your time a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if the people are glad to be in a company, feel that their voices are heard and that the work that you are worthwhile, then they feel stronger commitment to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience with LinkedIn, both Convercent and Glint. "</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach unselling if their portfolio companies are well run. companies are running well if employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">"if the analytics tools of third parties promise, dedication and commitment to increase staff, it is no wonder that you will find support."</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employees engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"however, the data is useless if the administrator of a business does not take any action."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"in fact, if a company asks staff after your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on its way."</seg>
<seg id="2248">"and if the shift does not come fast enough, or not at all, can discourage the disappointments and cultivate them."</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be willing to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen the company to rely on collecting data. "</seg>
<seg id="2250">"because if you do not follow people," have you really heard? "</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"and if you don't care about it, why should I?"</seg>
<seg id="2253">"Madison Reed, who runs every monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem with Glint reports, so salvation."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"after collecting feedback from frustrated employees it was due to the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, capable of organizing several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems."</seg>
<seg id="2255">"at Ruby Tuesday, the company receives new insights on the employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this leads to a better relation of workers in a branch that is known for high turnover."</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose man," said Vitrano. "</seg>
<seg id="2257">"and if you lose man, you also lose customers."</seg>

<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book by Rhodes, based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British library - a project which he was unexpected emotionally."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only responded to the thumbs on the side of a letter so reacted, which was written by a double-agony in the 1700's, he says for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>

<seg id="2304">"he walks through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, and spoke with landscaping rivers, gardeners and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, at night he drank, whiskey and started to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust did not get the full access since 2006, when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>

<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse in the British history, including 'The Labourer', which leaves a man who built the newly built castle in order to join the peasant status of 1381."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it would not be crazy about 2017, a new report comes about technological developments in the field of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, in fact."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex-robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR) released a report on the development of sex robots from the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emeritified professor for robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start to take her rise seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye-color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernagel."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people are talking about them, but the companies provide plenty of them and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey in the release of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">"modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a Silicone, which feels warm - with consciously human reactions made by artificial intelligence."</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust his robot according to his convictions," "and select everything from the eye-color of the robot to the type or colour of its fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it is more disturbing, as many robots have the" "personalities" "which would be a steppe-wife of progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicon skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix-robot allows for example to adapt its users to its robots to the characteristics that they will be appealing, such as relieve."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the" True Companion developed Roxxxy Gold sex-robots with pre-programmed personalities as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shudder and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality. "</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality, which is adapted to your personality as good as possible," blackup the website of True Companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so may they like what you like, and she does not like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">She has over the course of the day her moods - really like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it may be tired, fixed on condensation or it can be" "in mood." ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in the rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subordinate female properties, taking a step on Frigid (said here: refuge) Farrah, beunquiet one most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website true Companion Roxxxy with a vibration, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibration, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" is it on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a feeling of sex or just just another shy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their origins and their increasing refinement show some dark and deeper insight in our culture to retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course have no sex robots, and while the FRR witnessed their increasing popularity, they nevertheless remain provisional at the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what out of the edge-zones can be leased, in terms of the spirit of time we live, very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"and many people are not strange or belated, until they give the free market the permission."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is however a certain overcutting that these highly developed sex robots occur at a time when the rights of women are threatened throughout the world, in which there is a president in the White House, who has served to have sexually offences."</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most terrible aspect of the television series' The handmaid's Tales' ('The Report of the Magd') are not the graphical images that ensued body and the engraved eyes but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with Pornostar proportions)."</seg>
<seg id="2418">Your builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, to the point when it comes to its" personalities, "the robots represent no real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">You can not separate yourself from your companion or simply going away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background history, nothing that could disturb on independence or anything that could interfere with the fantasy of total submission."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, milk products and chocolate could help, IBD (inflammation)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims the exact opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based protector and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million and in the U.K. 300.000, causing stomach uptions and paralysis, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while those affected are usually come to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found an essential amino acid tryptophan by proteins to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant digestive."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestines declared to ensure that damaging microbes that hide in the food, do not enter into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells, which are capable of compensate inflammation, are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in a inflammatory deficit."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experiments, I found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice occurs to carry out a specific bacterium in its entry."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins to dissolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacterial infection - Lactobacillus reutery - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an an tryptophan rich diet caused tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal fluids, if the same system is also with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, but found that a group of study tastes carried such cells, but a different group of the same tribe but which was not divided."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiomes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms which usually live in the stomach astro-intestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of the mice have been spotted DNA sequentially and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells, but without them defective with the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they mised a intestinal microbiom and they did not developed this kind of immune cells, and they were created by L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria carried out on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri left the liquid hand and then transferred small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that have been isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerable cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the Tryptophan-Metabolism that is known as indol-3-lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers redoubled the amount of tryptophan in the forage of the mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but when the tryptopical values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us protect ourselves in our stomach-Intestinal tractors."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-offences from L. reuteri the cells can develop in people as with mice, but defects in Genen in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflamed boiling."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, since these cells are inflammation towards the inner surface of the intestines. "</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptopical levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to a expansion of this population.</seg>

<seg id="2882">"in the area of the detachment of Stolzenau, he came to him a car on his lane, so that he had to soften the right."</seg>
<seg id="2883">The touching the touran driver the ladders.</seg>

<seg id="2885">"the driver of the opposite car, a Mercedes Benz, had outdated a truck and continued his trip without worrying about the traffic accident."</seg>
<seg id="2886">"according to the ingenuity, it may be good that the Mercedar-driver had not noticed the accident at all."</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Report released Pope Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-report on the misuse cases uncontaminated Pope Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This thinks author and historian Michael Hemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report for the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen will continue for discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, Speaker of the reform movement" We are Church, "stated after the release opposite the German press agency, he expect from the former Regensburger bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their profound regret of their own submissions or their then false assessment of the processes."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican Council" Osservatore Romano "," however, criticized that in the coverage of violence against the Domspatzen with "" double measure "." "</seg>
<seg id="2895">"with respect to the handles in Regensburg, no-doubt that it must be punished and shameful actions, but the" degree of medial manipulation, "such as the" degree of medial manipulation, "such as the authors of Lucetta Scaraffia, historiography and member of the national Italian bioethics committees."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit, the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of everyday life experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal for normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"also Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "one likes to see the church and this is a good Fressen."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"in addition, she pointed out that in her youth" "blows a quite normal pedagogical means" "were to be done with free children, as I was of one to be finished."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"they are unfair to apply today's standards for past decades, because the world have changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with reports on the abuse of abuse, the Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger often emerged."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrong, says author and historian Michael Hemann, who has dealt with Ratzinger's memorting" "My brother of the Pope" (in 12 languages). "</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all that had nothing to do with him," he adds the findings of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the diocese of Regensburg with the explanation Ulrich Weber Weber (in German)?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s" "with high plausibility" victims of vials, 67 Domspatzen sexually abuses. "</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" in summary, so that the Domkapellmeister R. is used in many cases forms of physical and psychic violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotion, the punishment for the students could also be fierce."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, unlike many other accused, many victims reported the general humanity by R., and therefore in many cases despite violence even connect positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann, why the final report for the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger explained his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-pages report on the" "incidents of non-clouding" "is a conflicting image by Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"on the one hand, many students will highlight his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist that became hand-tangible when a domain was musically no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as his biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you read the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself rather why the name Georg Ratzinger thinks about it all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted by any suspicion of countering or co-tenant in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">"also, the non-violence exhibition at the preschschule is outside his sphere of efficiency."</seg>
<seg id="2916">"you can throw him at a time, not too late or have taken the first postures seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the dreaming school, in which it worked, was conceived by practically all respondents as - as literally -" redemption "," "" Heaven "" and "" better world "." "</seg>
<seg id="2918">"this also marks the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger, an excellent record, describes it as" warm "," "sincerely," "sincerely," "competently," "competently," "competently," "competently, and" "always catered with cake, biscuits, and" always of grapes of children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority is complying about his perfectionism and high emotion, which also led to wine-brood."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he did not only knit with chairs and threw the kissed and heed to the ground, but also earnesty guys in the hair or ears, he has already pointed out years ago, deeply regret and excused for it excused."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, to his honorary capacity, however, must be told that such investigations in the fragmentary time, the 1960s and 1970s were widely used, with parents as at teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such a breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a worldly school, a state-Gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to that, what is actually happening in this report, namely the genuine sexual abuse and the nonviolence at the preschool, are the subject of dreadful dreadels."</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it's not with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedikt XVI. to do that many media has just rushed to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">"at the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him, still eiving him."</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report relieved Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, related to the report was reported much about the issue of abuse on the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the Clinical Study Report as well as any connection or co-action with regard to sexual abuse is put to the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not a single of the 67 victims of sexual transformers claims to have become familiar with the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never seen me to speak with my father or mother," said a subject of being for the others, "It was all very embarrassing."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the education of sexual abuse was and yet is that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they didn't even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral manager, who would have been certain as a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-pupils Ratzinger's role in view of the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a respondent student worded it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see any case in which he would have had timely findings and could have stopped the respective offenders.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd to suppose that in case of him... Bubble intruder or more clearly or rather open, than towards their parents, dormitory, trust, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you speak to him about sex... - undetable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report comes to the very clear result:" that entrusted him in advance to the students and / or their environment in advance, could not be confirmed as part of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free of charge of each fellow-knowledge."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, it cannot be dissent to him or have brought him to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is also no reason to associate his good name with those resistent crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media was much of" "violence" "to read with the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The previous Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger was re-assaulted in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live in this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the reporting everything mixed and distorted became a huge milder from sexual abuse and nonviolence, and somewhere, in the midst of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"however, that is precisely the abuse of the report."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, it is to be found clean: between the preschschule and the grammar school, between sexual abuse and nonviolence, we say once, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"moreover, the report deals with the report from the time since 1945, thus also from four decades, where Georg Ratzinger was not the chorus of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which lad of sadic teachers regulates and malnourished, enrolled themselves at the preschschule in Etterzhausen and Pieldhofen, where really scandalous states."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, for he got the boy only to face when they were already on the cathedral-job."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"upon this, as most witnesses raised the topic of" "preschschule" "school."</seg>
<seg id="2955">"one was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment, and for many even" heavenly "conditions."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different in the domain of the cathedral?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was a discipline that there was no sprocal violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims threaten the general humanity by R., and therefore in many cases despite violence even connect positive memories with it. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"so, at the most one still the throw away, to have looked."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported from the states at preschschule."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the events at a school, which he was not acting and responsible, (so the witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then again at 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Wear Georg Ratzinger thinks of states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the domain name, which the report even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points to this point out," that in the preschschule I will continue to practised the test. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already given the danger of negative media, he recommended it to progress."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"of course, that was of course at a time when a legal clarity consisted in Bavaria too."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they stirred up in a legal gray area, like everyone of us still knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult for him to estimate too, where the sufferers may perhaps be exaggerated or dramatic, and where really the permissible border had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but one can also not say, he had always looked there."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis maintained yes it is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standard at the time of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we were talking about the" "pitfalls of the anachronism", "thus the danger of today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has been quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse at all times and also not for what was broken in the preschool to adversity and violence against innocent children's disease, which goes far beyond that then practicing."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all quite awful and I am glad that it is finally working.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger, for all that has nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means for disciplining and punishment, so earing, and retreat to the hair and ears, were widely used in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as a physical punishment, he has also strictly abide by it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"which picture of his ingenious period has existed Georg Ratzinger, for talks with you for the book" "My brother of Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of testing also related to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, told his perspective, since the Domspatzen played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I do not tolerate that he was a stricter Regiment."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but that must be said once again: without this perfectionism, without the call of unconditional discipline, it would hardly be possible to form an institution of world transpy, true cultural ban on Europe and his musical tradition that went straight to the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and bondwomen alone, one does not even make a great singer and stand before every success, right in which area, yet always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">As what kind of people do you have experienced Georg Ratzinger in their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition I experienced Georg Ratzinger really well and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deep believing and hearted people, from which one can't imagine that he could just have something to do with a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I am regularly coming up with, like many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after its Emergency, regularly contact him, read it, he read it - he is almost blind - and he treat him as a member of their family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was strictly speaking to them, so are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he enriched their lives and gave them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always was a good, vending teacher - a stringent father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respect, to which they still look up and who live straight."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clear: everything you ask him are the educator methods that were then on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even prominent brother to make the medial scapegoats."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"that is the bad intention, that is behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just released, relieved him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the bombed was born, a 93-year-old man who acquired great service and without the outside Bavaria, and perhaps Germany would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen (Germany), finally in peace."</seg>
