this has made clear the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ambig@@ uous .
&quot; I will always be plug@@ ged in drawers , or be glu@@ ed from the outside label that usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; honestly speaking , these things are more ni@@ b@@ ble . &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only lau@@ gh it that she says as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she says in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ oms . &quot;

gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sport@@ pyramid
his experience on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a little bit conf@@ using with a horseback ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a first .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses reminded of their holiday ; they said in the fast Gal@@ lop back home to the feed tr@@ ays .
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I have fear . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and it ended the riding career then again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament winners - again close to horses .
&quot; he led himself with his family over the facility of the AL@@ RV , on a horse , he did not swing to a photograph . &quot;
&quot; long was the first time in Aachen , and thus also with CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Spor@@ th@@ ilfe persu@@ aded the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small g@@ ala the Gol@@ dene Sport@@ pyramid .
at awards the sympath@@ etic ath@@ l@@ ete does not .
&quot; Bundes@@ la@@ zi@@ z , Silver nes Lor@@ ed@@ er@@ blatt , Champions Tour of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already paved him .
longer is the 18th prize winners of the Sport@@ pyramid .
in Aachen he met Hans GÃ¼nter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; said Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is not only awarded for spor@@ tive successes but also for social engagement . &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger encourages talent .
&quot; and so , he gave the prize money of 25.000 Euro as well . &quot;
&quot; with 15 further outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time master &apos;s winner was recorded on Saturday to the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; among the excellent include the Ath@@ ath@@ l@@ eten Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard G@@ ien@@ ger , the Ru@@ ck@@ ka Frank Wien@@ eke , the jumping captain Frank Wien@@ eke , the jumping Al@@ win shock @-@ cave and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand of all Erhard . &quot;
many of these sports competitions were closed on Saturday to Aachen .
after the official part I went the illustr@@ ative company into the spr@@ ing@@ stadium where the Lav@@ azza Prize was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger lasted a distance to the big animals .
cl@@ int@@ ons and Tru@@ mp@@ s economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
we invest in infrastructure and avoid the T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; none of them are the two US presidential assessment , however , in tax and energy policies , as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , rather philosoph@@ ical difference . &quot;
the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp seeks to hold the doubts rather small and war@@ ns about how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton w@@ ool the economy of death and regulate them to death .
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different . &quot;
&quot; it will massi@@ vely go back regul@@ ators , and it makes up a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower control sets strong - for individuals and for enterprises . &quot;
&quot; Clinton on the other hand , says : the state has specific tasks to open up opportunities and needs money for it . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the taxes would increase for the rich , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the issue of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Tru@@ mp and Clinton say almost wor@@ t@@ equal . &quot;
the democratic assessment announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ er@@ y @-@ wing of the republi@@ cans .
&quot; so , in Tru@@ mp , you could also come to partial internal discussions . &quot;
&quot; more clearly , the differences in the energy and climate policies are marked . &quot;
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ power plants and rebuild the coal production in the US .
&quot; oil @-@ promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas , to termin@@ ate the Paris climate protection agreement . &quot;
&quot; Clinton in contrast to further expanding the energies with its investment programme , and demands : &quot; &quot; a country will make the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in infrastructure - also in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away . &quot;
TP@@ P that tran@@ sp@@ aci@@ fish trade agreements do both not sign .
&quot; at the same time , both of them do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade but just to protect American jobs . &quot;
the aim is to pay for better things about Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger .
it wants to raise it on 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp does not want to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage is down , then he says he could not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months would probably rather likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand is Tru@@ mp , who wants to cover the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics point out to him , so that the deficit deficit would be just bigger . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who want to ask at least from the rich , that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is one of women who run alone , almost already for everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traum@@ atis@@ ed . &quot;
a house offers refu@@ ge .
in a large kitchen sitting four women .
each has a baby here which is at the most one year old .
a little son placed in my arms .
he gu@@ cked with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother vibr@@ ates on the car@@ penter .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iled short and k@@ issed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; it is part of Con@@ dro@@ bs department , a carrier for social assistance services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the subject of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are fl@@ ashed .
they live in MÃ¼n@@ ch@@ ner north in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodations for all affected women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the MÃ¼n@@ ch@@ ner Women &apos;s relief .
&quot; since then , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - also not as visitors .
the exception is an guard against the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here , has made experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men escape because of wars because they are persec@@ uted because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families will send them to hope for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in women , other reasons for the run : &quot; many ste@@ al themselves secre@@ tly for them , because they see no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home they have experience with sexual violence , forced mar@@ riages , honest@@ y or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this drives them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs for instance require a bottle of water a sexual act is not rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they came in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; again , single women in Refu@@ ge@@ es would often have been regarded as in@@ fer@@ ior and worse in cases . &quot;
&quot; this leads to about 90 per cent of women who reside in the north of the MÃ¼n@@ ch@@ ner North , they appreci@@ ates them . &quot;
&quot; some of the children were certainly not optional . &quot;
many women were so used to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t have to speak openly about the experience , because the Sch@@ ame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they often do not help w@@ rest@@ less , it would need more accommodations just for them . &quot;
the seven district authorities in Bavaria are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
&quot; on the question whether they w@@ aver from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some will answer some with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are something for example in accommodation of governments not . &quot;
&quot; also in Schw@@ aben are not separate alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ person of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Middle @-@ fran@@ ken there are in some common shel@@ ters or private houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men .
&quot; in a study which was published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; lacks privacy , or are men and women to be accommod@@ ated , it can come to - continual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; most of all , the washing rooms should be easily accessible and easily accessible to women , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel that need in need of this protection , it is possible to read the crowds that puts it to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; ever spoken of itself has spoken to us , we have a long wa@@ ist , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily make a second house .
assistance : demands for new working @-@ projects
&quot; the members of the assistance in Assi@@ stance , have called on their union to strengthen new working measures in their disputes relating to a new contract . &quot;
&quot; the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has requested its entire Council to strengthen its work@@ manship , beginning September beginning . &quot;
&quot; the J@@ DC said that the ministers had to ad@@ minister , to responding to the concerns relating to the contract . &quot;
&quot; assistance , Assi@@ stance and medical students have been coordinated in July on the ref@@ us@@ al of a contract which was agreed with BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members , who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained silent on the problems , which led to the treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; in view of this has voted the J@@ DC board , to reject the proposed new treaty and is concerned about the official release of all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board released a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to resume a continuing program of escal@@ ating labour measures , which begins beginning September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes resulted in Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ enti@@ sts this year in the sixth strike , the first total accidents in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the head of BM@@ A Assi@@ stance Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions , which had been recommended by BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which were even ahead of the vote of 54.@@ 000 Assi@@ stance and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; following the vote , the Minister Mr Jerem@@ y Hunt , that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of outside &quot; &quot; ?
it was a gesture that a crisis ended .
&quot; leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands , and pre@@ ach an official end to the eight months of the long @-@ lasting war of words and economic sanctions . &quot;
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin accepts his Turkish counter@@ parts in the g@@ ild@@ ed hall of the St. Petersburg , I cannot deny myself that Ankara won this reconciliation most . &quot;
&quot; there was the rash , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile over dirty and he radi@@ ated barely warmth , even for its reserved conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; , &quot; according to a report full of five times . &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also spoke that relations with Russia would not only return to their old levels prior to the crisis , but can even be improved . &quot;
&quot; the next day described a newspaper that Erdo@@ gan would benefit , as if it had never been worse . &quot;
I seemed to tell me more the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin radi@@ ant , sustainable bol@@ le showed that the state of Russia was nothing forgotten . &quot;
rather the cause of the crisis was the first one mentioned in his introduc@@ tions : the shoot of a Russian fighter plane was at the Syrian border with Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was curved .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to have fallen in his back .
the mistake was even greater since it was committed by a alleged friend .
Vet@@ r@@ ust restore it becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the nation@@ ally controlled media led a strong , unlimited attack on Ankara . &quot;
it seemed like the Turks would have to blame for everything .
&quot; on the serious occasion , the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan benef@@ ited from illi@@ c@@ it &apos;s own family from illi@@ c@@ entering into Syria , which controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has denied this veh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it is time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting was held only because Putin was granted the excuse to hear that he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could make a kind of victory .
for Ankara the benefits of a c@@ eas@@ e@@ fire is clear on hand .
&quot; Erdo@@ gan requires all the friends that he can get , after spending the last month by a failed cou@@ p@@ ation of almost his ministry . &quot;
repeated terrorist attack on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring millions of Russian tourists into the Turkish coast each year .
the number is decreased by nearly 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated when the flights are picked up again . &quot;
they are counted on a late @-@ season An@@ dam@@ m of the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week forecasts the state TV , cheap fruit and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agriculture imported . &quot;
&quot; a report made in Ve@@ demo@@ sti says it : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is reli@@ eved in the West , since its reaction to trying to get a weak response to power . &quot;
&quot; this daily Gro@@ ll will come across the sn@@ ail out of the EU accession negotiations and Putin , the er@@ un@@ ks to move from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; the Russian State of Russia won in Ankara with security , that he called for the state @-@ of @-@ state support for the elected government bodies . &quot;
&quot; this is well @-@ done for Moscow is a matter of course , which itself has a profound fear of reg@@ im@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; meeting in this splendid palace at the sea , it enabled Russia and Turkey , a analy@@ st how it was once a analy@@ st once described , &quot; &quot; alliance of outside , &quot; &quot; two countries who come across from the West and have poor@@ ly dealt with . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in spite of public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two countries . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference in Syria , where Moscow has recently joined the role of a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey have counter@@ posed sites . &quot;
&quot; it might be significant that after almost three hours of first talks both Presidents met at the press conference , that they did not even comprehend the issue . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , the President of Turkey avoided it to respond to a question about their differences , while Putin decided to stress this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found to Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disp@@ aster , when NATO member would f@@ oss the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders at least talk again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland is no longer available
according to the leader R@@ BS the brand R@@ BS is said to be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the head @-@ ste@@ er of the bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan distributed the BBC Scotland with the global ambitions of the Bank .
the bank has since dist@@ anced itself since eight years ago she had to be almost coll@@ ap@@ sed and saved .
&quot; at this time , hall@@ marks &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumers . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to the Wimbledon winner Andy Murray . &quot;
but now she has decided to put more national brands into the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
&quot; in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and stock exchange at Nat@@ West will change . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for private customer business , which will get more significance - C@@ out@@ &apos;s , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a inspection route by customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will become our Invest@@ ors brand , as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS has become a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now , I say that we do not pursue any global goals but local targets . &quot;
each of these marks will be in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
R@@ BS has already argu@@ ed that it will not continue his Six Nations sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the perc@@ eptions of various brands in his sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to develop themselves to the Bank of the brands , because how do we concentrate in the inner ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal for three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , focusing on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these brands again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;

&quot; the three @-@ month winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won G@@ ha@@ y@@ yar , said : &quot; It is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
&quot; I am very happy that it &apos;s going to happen at New@@ market , because I arrived here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is an ordinary Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ ers when he got the victory for the victory
&quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacles race - Jo@@ ck@@ ey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ out winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who finished over 4,@@ 300 victories in a re@@ br@@ ittle career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 Kar@@ rier@@ esi@@ ans &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ck@@ ey of the modern age and it is not a surprise that he has reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that distingu@@ ishes it from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic amb@@ assador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma enthusiastic fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already fet@@ ched 6,000 profits , if he would not only be a weekend and big tur@@ no@@ jo@@ ck@@ ey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already been winning in the UK for nearly 30 years of winning what is great .
&quot; he has a vibrant personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ck@@ ey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from flying finishes to Flying Dis@@ mo@@ unts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of British low@@ lands for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of big tur@@ ni@@ sts , including his famous &quot; glorious Seven &quot; in 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug . &quot;
&quot; three years ago he initially had difficulty , when he returned from his six@@ teen lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y its branches and to return to his existence . &quot;
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori was told earlier that he will continue with competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years .
Russia Putin feu@@ dal St@@ ef Sergei Ivan@@ ov
the Russian president Vladimir Putin did not fores@@ ee his staff President Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a lot of years part of the narro@@ wer confidence circle of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to the Special Represent@@ atives for environmental and carriers .
&quot; in a position of the Krem@@ lin , it is that Putin has arranged according to his duties as the chairman of the Russian president . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was appointed for his successor since 2012 , was appointed to its successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital city of Tallinn , he made his degree at the renowned State Department of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Krem@@ lin , it is ( on Russian ) that he later was the president and staff manager of the government . &quot;
&quot; he said to his appointment , &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your work as a state of state of law , and controls the implementation of your instructions . &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV transm@@ itter on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov has asked to leave his post and have recommended V@@ ain@@ o as its successor .
to convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergey Ivan@@ ov was a long time in the closest Vladimir Putin and works like him for Soviet security service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as a St@@ ef , he was one of the most powerful men of the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , on TV broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men asser@@ ted that the Stab@@ St@@ ef rel@@ ay on his own wish . &quot;
&quot; but despite the sl@@ ain for the cameras , here are just a few of them - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
this is currently no one knows .
&quot; but the official statement that a man who was once praised as a potential president , would like to direct the Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks on Putin , which are quoted on the website of the Krem@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; &quot; it is true that I had asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , I could almost say - compl@@ em@@ able positions for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been president of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin &apos;s former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was the Chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , which was appointed the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his representative . &quot;
as Putin sent to power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people who knew the most familiar .
once was believed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia as a third term in Putin against the Constitution .
&quot; but this post was taken by a further , near ally Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became the prime minister before he became president of three and a half years later .

Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the Â£ 1,35 â¬ expensive project may be completed by May 2017
engineers have joined the Nord@@ deck of the Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - what does that the bridge is now connected to fi@@ fe now .
&quot; it is the first of the four resolutions of the &quot; &quot; cover blo@@ wer &quot; , &quot; approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the head@@ line of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 ton .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 steel rop@@ es . &quot;
the Â£ 1,35 â¬ expensive project may be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; Keit@@ h Brown took over the site , and was one of the first to go onto the bridge from the country . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment when the construction of the que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineer at a truly ep@@ ic degree in this project with more than 30.000 ton concrete and steel working alone for that part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the clip is between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the di@@ mm@@ able activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the total ch@@ ess@@ ons in their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks gets today in Ros@@ y@@ th a bet@@ ong@@ uss for the Deck , which means the entire deck is ready to be taken on the bridge at its place . &quot;
Michael Martin , Project Le@@ aders of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first decision represents a significant milestone in each cycle project . &quot;
in this fantastic project the short@@ cut forward @-@ looking forward @-@ setting and low @-@ sea @-@ construction represents .
&quot; after installing the last street section and its connection with the north @-@ wide deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or country side . &quot;
this was reached by drag@@ ging the northern hemisph@@ ere to 700 milli@@ metres in the south .
this was massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massi@@ f that the vi@@ adu@@ ct 222 meters long is , about 6,000 tons , and at a slope of about 3 % to be drag@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; heal , since the toler@@ ances , on which the team is working , tiny - on each side they rested only a few milli@@ metres . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue at the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; happiness to be alive &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; fortunate to be alive &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off from their fishing boat from the angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI lif@@ ebo@@ at station suggested on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm after a crew observed the event at Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim in security , while their boat moved out of their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat was turned around and turned the worst before , &quot; said the head of the lif@@ ebo@@ at station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds that sail@@ ed the boat apart from its range until we left to water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fisher@@ y , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found in a boat without a b@@ ail@@ out . &quot;
they all came on board the coastal pot and were brought back to the lif@@ ebo@@ at station .
&quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have happiness in@@ ju@@ red and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat trip had a stop@@ over , however , these extingu@@ ished in the ken@@ ing of the bot from the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has spoken today about these men today .
difficult hurt - man sti@@ r on his ex @-@ friend
one man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; as the police returned yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had gotten the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
instead the cut of non @-@ alcoholic beverages is the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
&quot; when this came into the apartment , he twice on them . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was in@@ ju@@ red by the hand and at the body .
the police could establish the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend destroyed , he called his mother . &quot;
this aler@@ ts as a result of his sister .
&quot; together with their partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm down her brother . &quot;
&quot; however , it could not move it to leave the apartment . &quot;
&quot; therefore , they went out of the house with their partner . &quot;
on the road they met the ex @-@ spirits of the man .
&quot; when the two women re@@ mar@@ ry the apartment again , the top of the 50 @-@ year @-@ old his sister to the side and handle his ex @-@ friend . &quot;
who is building a lot of cheap apartments ?
&quot; in future , the SPD and Green mean : investors should be taken much stronger in future . &quot;
how does one react to bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing to have a &quot; &quot; action concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
first and foremost about the question : who should build low prices ?
a scheme is still missing .
&quot; EPP Group Leader Christoph Brat@@ mann means : &quot; &quot; we are in agreement with the Gre@@ ens : who plans to build on urban areas in future , must show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the favorable apartments may also arise in the stock . &quot;
&quot; but the big dispute point in the city hall is , however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you go with investors to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors on such plots at least 10 percent , but building as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban construction programme , which will cost millions of costs and will be financed and should provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the Problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the groups . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as a few rules as possible .
the left wants to take no tough@@ ness for investors .
&quot; regardless of what , so viol@@ a , b@@ ah@@ ne is a tight@@ ening of the situation in the housing market . &quot;
&quot; the action of action is implemented , that will ensure additional tasks in the building management . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the specialists .
&quot; the program is not entirely clear : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how do you compare the loss of further 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments , whose funding will run in the coming years ? &quot;
&quot; until the year 2020 , it will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , such as planned spokes@@ men , Nicole Palm , should now be rep@@ lic@@ ted out from the city now . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it would have to be thought to get back to the price delivery . &quot;
this is possible in the West city .
&quot; in one fell s@@ woo@@ p , the problem could solve . &quot;
&quot; because in the west town , the dates are due to the end of the year . &quot;
around 1800 apartments you could get back in price delivery for affordable housing .
only : they do not want the owners , the building companies . &quot;
&quot; for the number of social housing in the West city dramatically increases , it is from the destination of so @-@ called mixing . &quot;
a concentration of social @-@ weak in just a few neighbour@@ hoods should no longer be given .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be even movement in the discussion .
&quot; leader of the Holger Her@@ lit@@ ch@@ ke writes : &quot; for a vast majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot;
&quot; though , they concentrated on more construction sites for single @-@ family homes . &quot;
but what does not mean that a compromise can not be found yet .
&quot; Po@@ k@@ Ã©@@ mon Go , a hunting for health and happiness that worth it &quot;
it is fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
&quot; that teen@@ ager and child have no longer go outside for playing , but rather prefer to spend their free time to star@@ ring on screens , has been interpreted in the last decade of many . &quot;
&quot; at Po@@ k@@ emon Go , it is about bringing people from the sofa and become more active . &quot;
&quot; the time on screen was initially limited to TV , then on video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; naturally I refer to the Po@@ k@@ Ã©@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that was created on the characters , initially created for the video games in the 199@@ 0@@ ies ( later evolved from a drawing series , game cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; like many phenomena of pop culture , interest in front of the game &apos;s publication in the U.S. , Australia and New Zealand in early July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the servers over@@ bur@@ dened .
&quot; within a few days , Po@@ k@@ Ã©@@ mon could go more users as ink and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players with their smartphones go outside and look for Po@@ k@@ Ã©@@ m@@ ons that are tr@@ acked with a GPS and once they were once found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( through a screens@@ hot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one generation who played the game , when she was still younger , joined the W@@ ahn and sp@@ rang out for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable rise in steps that swe@@ pt the &quot; average &quot; person every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ og@@ ram , an app for Apple Watch that followed the 35.@@ 000 user , told the Washington Post recently agreed that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of persec@@ uted people , each day , 30 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who of which Po@@ k@@ Ã©@@ mon Go plays - it only sees the raw data to enhance the performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns to health which want to bring people to &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &apos; to come &quot; , &quot; from the sofa to come &quot; and &quot; to be active every day , because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the significance of sport cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; who drives a regular sport , reduces its chances of suffering from cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonderful thing to Po@@ k@@ Ã©@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , to make them fun . &quot;
&quot; there are three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun . &quot;
some people join the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as usual , there are also mos@@ quit@@ ous toys that have to always complain about something compl@@ aining about . &quot;
and yes someone could walk against a door .
what is it ?
it has a breakthrough .
&quot; even if Smartphone Apps could already follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its attrac@@ tiveness and the use will be given at the time .
&quot; because of Po@@ k@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , however , there will be more games to unite the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ism in the real world and help many people to be hunting , more active , bit@@ ters and healthier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the D@@ ament@@ a@@ nen
forget the print .

Simone Bil@@ es is located on all this im@@ mu@@ n .
dynamic at the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breath@@ tak@@ ingly on the floor .
on gan@@ zer line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ ress .
the 19 @-@ year American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for the multi @-@ term title and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
&quot; their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 clearly was in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; &quot; Final Five &quot; &quot; team hon@@ ors A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ a@@ sts of Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the Americans of Simone Bil@@ es played on the sul@@ p@@ sich@@ ord during the single @-@ majority of women in the art collection at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ it is the fourth heter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual US , which wins a multi @-@ term title and overall the fifth , while she strength@@ ens its reputation , the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
&quot; it broke out in tears , when their end result was shown and their long journey into this moment was an end . &quot;
&quot; this success presents them in the same league as unique athletes , such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ ly , the last three years has domin@@ ates their sport medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises , that the Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ ress of 1984 Mary Lou Rett@@ on from her said that she is &quot; the best Tur@@ ner@@ in , that I have ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it was expected to have a final examination in Brazil , a competition which was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden @-@ dimension@@ ed expectations . &quot;
&quot; not going back with a handful of gold back to family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americans of Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace taking gold and silver in a multi @-@ majority for women in the art collection at the Olympic Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ ly fet@@ ched the first medal on Tuesday , while she was at the f@@ arewell party that served in retirement People &apos;s Co@@ ordinator , Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as exec@@ utions . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on the top , while her long way to lead to the top , never the future is planned , this is not really true . &quot;
part of her for@@ ting exercises - which includes their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music which would fit at home outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
&quot; this girl , who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother while a school excursion into the gymn@@ asium , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man , became the power . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no multi @-@ party competition , a vict@@ orious series that will last for as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Z@@ af@@ ina led easily by two shooting , the picture brought the picture . &quot;
Swedish @-@ beam and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ nen - in which Bil@@ es hold the world title - lou@@ der .
&quot; she returned again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam up - and sat down with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man um@@ b them gently as they were expecting their end @-@ to @-@ end - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears currents on Bil@@ es Th@@ iny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision they once described in her tac@@ tical book . &quot;
&quot; the achievement of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medals at a Ti@@ eb@@ r@@ ake in Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time had the 22 @-@ year @-@ year team of teams , called by Americans &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; a lead . &quot;
&quot; after its ground exercise , she thre@@ w them to the public Kus@@ sh@@ alls , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed du@@ bi@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; as it concerns , the rapidly changing t@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a whole new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims of mass destruction in music listening in the car
&quot; according to police report published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl got killed in one of the most deadly attacks of Phoenix for a decade , while they stopped their way in the car and heard their music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Lin@@ er , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah was shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ v@@ eway , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator eight shots from a handker@@ chief , while he was on the passenger &apos;s side of the car and then flew with another vehicle , is to read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police shared with that the triple murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ bery @-@ tak@@ eover , as the Att@@ acker doesn &apos;t take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2.@@ 900 who found themselves in possession of an adult sacrific@@ es . &quot;
the pol@@ z@@ eis@@ pre@@ cher by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard was told that the shooting broke the investig@@ ators to become closer to whether they are connected to four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , predominantly in h@@ isp@@ anic neighbour@@ hoods were killed in nine months in nine attacks and two others in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , an affiliate of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown n@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ ll@@ ac or Lincoln . &quot;
&quot; the investig@@ ators refused to off@@ end the evidence that they have led to the conclusion , that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized due to their violations and died later . &quot;
&quot; Lin@@ er , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died before the place . &quot;
witness the police with that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which turned onto an empty pick@@ up truck a half hour before the thre@@ e@@ fold murder and that it turned out , that it was the work of the mass itself . &quot;
investig@@ ators found patches and secured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as ball @-@ frag@@ ments from the motor room .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old loves Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto the singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of his anti@@ quity , Ed@@ mund micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto knew nothing about her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time was my first thought , I managed not . &quot;
I do not manage this .
I did not let myself down .
&quot; not right now -- of course one has left himself , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; your husband Vincent and her was informed that Ed@@ mund she will never be able to recognize them , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they sm@@ ote him to institution@@ alize it .
&quot; my first answer to it &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a wal@@ ker .
Ed@@ mund was not able to sit down to his third year and he can still not speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
he can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play with his two brothers and sing .
Elizabeth presents the sign language that Ed@@ mund was intended for &quot; Please sing to me something . &quot;
&quot; we bring him drawing language at , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News . &quot;
but there is no typical sign language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
&quot; micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic , as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as mask or coron@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy . &quot;
symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect life &apos;s life with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of an un@@ certain future .
I wonder@@ ed what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and yet it still does not really know .
I haven &apos;t been asked for a long time after a progn@@ osis because I do not wait to tell me someone really .
&quot; but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects , which were caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus . &quot;
it will be better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

the other two victims were not found in the car and police just find whether one of the most recent men of the perpet@@ rators could be found .
Er@@ it@@ ters shared C@@ BS Philadelphia so that it seems to have come to a fire of fire between several guns .
Pat@@ ron@@ y@@ ses for storm @-@ hon@@ ed who were trac@@ ed to various Stur@@ ges , over@@ se@@ ated the scene . &quot;
it seems clear that this is un@@ ambig@@ uous for a permanent struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk , found H@@ Ã¼l@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; so , there seems to have been several armed fighter here , who were very active , the police dermat@@ p@@ mann Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di the police in Philadelphia to the station . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles taken in the area .
there was no celebration and the police are checking the surveillance video at that time .
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year girl had hit by a cross @-@ r@@ ack@@ et on his arm while she played before her house in the West O@@ ak Lane area . &quot;
she recovered and the police still looks for a suspic@@ ious .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
this is what I used to tell me under the Frauen@@ oly@@ mp@@ i@@ am@@ d in Tur@@ ns and that is more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been here in every summer oly@@ mp@@ i@@ ade since 1984 and the USA was never so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly : this team has three tur@@ ner , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspir@@ ational for many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this crew , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the JÃ¼@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ lics , ab@@ round , makes every pride . &quot;
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has become the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among the female turbine was one A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
&quot; last year , Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 . &quot;
this shows strength .
at the final Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas a surprising Olympi@@ ag@@ ew@@ inn@@ erin and America was che@@ ered .
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple performance of the triple world in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , how it was unexpected , but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics rout@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was won the fourth , heter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American , who won in an individual majority event for women gold . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man gained silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the top of this sport , but look out @-@ classes throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all sm@@ ote the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the oly@@ mp@@ ic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympi@@ am@@ ann@@ um will have only four tur@@ ner in the crew . besides , that is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality appears that exercising a more expensive sport is and can be maintained first and foremost in private residen@@ ces that are maintained by parents who pay for training , furniture , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their Tur@@ ner and families ) . the list can be removed . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ around are af@@ flu@@ ent in af@@ flu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
in these associations the Tur@@ ner receive their whole training and that is a great commitment to families and long @-@ term commitment .
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained their athletes , since they started with the turn . &quot;
&quot; we have to offer the congreg@@ ations au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , providing a high @-@ performance and easy accessible gymn@@ asium . &quot;
I was founded my turn@@ outs of 20 years ago .
&quot; at my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ s in Harlem for over 15.000 ur@@ b@@ ane te@@ ens ( above all black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winner . &quot;
in September we are expanding to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics to learn and to benefit from this great Olympic sport .
&quot; exercising develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and certainty for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and educational and professional success .
it &apos;s the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to interest for the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that is great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
it is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real portr@@ ay@@ al of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team and thank you to start their way to begin their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;

the Â£ 2 @-@ per day - A medication that can reduce the heart attack
thousands of heart disease patients will be benef@@ ited by a Â£ 2 @-@ per day after by the authorities to ad@@ minister this more people for a longer period .
the ger@@ inn@@ ed drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart attack for people with a heart disease .
&quot; the drug is administ@@ ered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or other heart attack . &quot;
the regulatory body nice by the N@@ HS has recommended a four years of in@@ ges@@ tion to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory body nice by the N@@ HS has recommended a four years of in@@ ges@@ tion to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; heart attack and stroke are caused by accumul@@ ations of fatty material in the arter@@ ies , the flo@@ cks are formed . &quot;
&quot; if the Bel@@ ag falls apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ot that is hidden from blood flow to the heart and thus causes a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; if the blood cl@@ ot sol@@ ves , it can flow through the blood stream and hiding the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
individuals who already had a heart attack subject to another risk to another risk .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and by trading name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; the settlement of nice , which was published today is recommended a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the nice health @-@ related research center said , &quot; despite the availability of secondary crises , a quarter of all individuals who suffered a heart attack , a further heart attack or stroke - often with disast@@ rous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have a considerable negative impact on the quality of life of a person .
&quot; the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing further heart attack and stro@@ kes in people , who already had a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; through a provisional recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are glad that we are able to expand available treatment options at thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the leader does not recommend treatment that go beyond this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ ectal sep@@ tic Sur@@ prising in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ ein Rah@@ man was removed last year on dism@@ iss@@ al of a government report due to corruption from the office .
a culture of Political Cor@@ respon@@ ness has led to that extensive choice of election in Muslim @-@ churches will be ignored as a crus@@ hing government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es res@@ igned verbal the police , ob@@ serving and Rath@@ geber for making evidence of electoral abuse on account of &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ b@@ ness and religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and community government , which is now an antagon@@ ism of religious motives , it would be that the police should be allowed to set up tre@@ adm@@ ills outside of the elect@@ ors to protect their voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should lead a identification with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at present , a elect@@ or@@ ate must only call its name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests , not even distant Tin@@ te on the finger of a person if they give her vote to prevent someone twice . &quot;
wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
it demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions of no official committees or working groups .
&quot; this not only for electoral fraud , but is also meant to protect the local government in front of the broader cor@@ rup@@ tive and finance culture , which it goes against , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by the Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Op@@ sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special court decided that the acting Mayor Lut@@ ein Rah@@ man was elected according to a le@@ it@@ tion of cor@@ rup@@ ting and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the court was that Rah@@ man had per@@ vert the religious feelings of his Muslim community , &quot; &quot; and that he would have brought his critics with a r@@ attle and Islam@@ opho@@ bic alleg@@ ations to silence . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the relative duty of Muslims , to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either du@@ bi@@ ous or the result of im@@ itation , if a person cho@@ oses a person than anyone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that in the whole country there was evidence of fraud .
he vo@@ iced in particular al@@ armed for frau@@ dul@@ ent envel@@ ope - in the older members of the Muslim community to have made pressure on people to choose a candidate for their choice .
&quot; Sir Eric , de@@ formed , made several recommendations for the electoral system , including the leader of expres@@ sing to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report , it &apos;s proof that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was ex@@ erted , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elder , particularly communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ical or ban@@ qu@@ oise background . &quot;
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions had such a conduct , due to &quot; politically correct &quot; over@@ sensitivity regarding ethnic and religion . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric said to 50 recommendations in order to clean the system , including the pro@@ hibition that political activ@@ ates can work in order to stop &quot; &quot; election &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also calls for tough@@ er registration investigations that is used to prevent the electoral directory to immigration and social @-@ discipline . &quot;
consider voters before choosing to ask for your credit card .
&quot; dis@@ able ink on the finger of a person will use , as soon as it has released their voice to prevent someone twice . &quot;
systematic re@@ viewing on the nationalities of a person to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year @-@ year @-@ effect on applications for an automatic brief@@ ing .
ban that political activ@@ ates complete letter and envel@@ opes of letter sel@@ ections .
the police have the authority to set up charges for electoral stations .
&quot; a legislative change , which facilit@@ ates an indic@@ t@@ ment for inti@@ mid@@ ation according to the re@@ pres@@ en@@ ation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Organization Act 1983 ) . &quot;
photographer in electoral stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the electoral stations ( except Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , to make sure that the staff usually enforce that voters are alone in the elect@@ or@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric goes beyond the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case no claim has been placed . &quot;
&quot; the electoral Court covered Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty for a pro@@ clam@@ ation of cor@@ rup@@ tive and illegal practices as disabled , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he has been sufficiently committed to a number of reasons for criminal proceedings - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also criti@@ ci@@ zed the &quot; &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ in@@ spec@@ tions &quot; &quot; of the Elect@@ oral registry from the Town Hall . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric said , &quot; The court unit in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal . &quot;
&quot; our country carries a respectable heritage as the mother of parliament , but the worrying and betra@@ yed prop@@ ag@@ ation of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities , thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;

&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , who fli@@ ed to the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL created a lists of Olympi@@ oni@@ ons that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Dutch . &quot;

&quot; besides K@@ ates double @-@ releases on the Rad@@ ren@@ n@@ bahn , many people watched at the Internet to be like a certain ar@@ cher of the Twin Towers from A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Br@@ ady Ell@@ ison has prov@@ oked a rush on Twitter after pictures , on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star in@@ hei@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the Ar@@ cher got the mad@@ ness in the social media with and gave it to hear that he has been hearing since his childhood , that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I do not see a great simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; distributed Br@@ ady the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I feel the probably as compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 this year will undoubtedly be at the center : the emerging simil@@ arity between the British Weit@@ inger Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .

another tense comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett was drawn similarly heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
&quot; the Russian silver medal in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points out more than just the sun@@ ni@@ cious skin and bl@@ on@@ the hair as the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ Cor@@ d , while the American Nathan was attacked by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; she said , &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the shop floor , she took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants out of the situation , moved their own ti@@ ghts and p@@ ants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , fre@@ ch as O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;

she reiter@@ ated the same with three other under@@ p@@ ants before she finally decided that you got nothing left to get caught up and down .
&quot; it did not seem to disturbing the fact that they observed someone watching or thinking about the person , who under certain circumstances the under@@ p@@ ants would buy them . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said , &quot; How to remember that someone would take home , who had a different person and which were not washed away . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday morning .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I have got , the staff tried to draw the clothing items from the sale , after she went - what is just as good . &quot;

how to protect with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before tru@@ ce
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail.com could make it safe for you . &quot;
&quot; we spoke with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York , to find out how to move around with armed rob@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; whether you are approaching from the front or back , this video will show you how to rot@@ ate for your pre@@ dator . &quot;
&quot; if you are approaching from behind , then you should turn it as a first , so that you can see your att@@ acker and embar@@ k out of the passing line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
grab the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free el@@ bows .
&quot; then hit him then with the knee in the bar and rot@@ ate you , while the Att@@ acker has tri@@ mm@@ ed before pain , the weapon from his hands . beat it with the run into the face and move upwards , while they set the gun towards him . &quot;
&quot; when att@@ ackers , which approach itself from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the stroke line , grab the gun and rot@@ ate them , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , you transfer the weight to the gun and beat the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the gun out of his hand before they move back and set the gun towards it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
take a look at the video to see as it Miz@@ ra@@ chi makes .
&quot; but remember that it is on the safest , your money is too abundant - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master . &quot;

&quot; fortunately , nothing left behind what he put , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; W@@ right became famous for taking the war@@ ding of his performers by traveled through the world , and fun as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public dis@@ change to train stations , up to sink of toilets , the task assigned to his immune system definitely among a sample &quot;
&quot; he told us : &quot; already as a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and fl@@ amm@@ ers . &quot;
in the film he was justified his reputation in any case .
&quot; the only thing he wrote , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot;
its pro@@ ges@@ tion showed a L@@ umin@@ ous series of over 4000 units .
&quot; compared to these , the L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ ies is fresh @-@ toler@@ ated hands less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to det@@ ained after its L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ ies over 4000 units , while fresh@@ ly washed hands one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o manufactured the travel &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to inner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number in different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; This comes the worst , which I have done in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing dirty than that !
I will do nothing here because it is inside the inside .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company releases Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , juices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explain the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we led mad bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings made that we said &quot; L@@ ass us Ian ph@@ ate .
they claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the meaning of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
&quot; the growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way . &quot;
also I think that the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who took the director of the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had told him some of the things that I have told him , just like the ek@@ el@@ ective Russian toilet that will be shown in the movie . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things when it was easier to bring Ian , they anz@@ lick , and others where that was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad that we made some of these dirty treats on film .
&quot; in one of the vali@@ dating conducted in 2015 , 84 percent of all surv@@ ey@@ ed lac@@ tic acid bacteria , especially with the well being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent told them that they were at least occasionally use the lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social family in front of Del@@ o@@ gi@@ bility Social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left their social unit after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication with a damage in the amount of Â£ 50,000 , because they had wre@@ cked their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; having been removed from her estate , sho@@ cked by her estate , we found his property in a ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls presented holes , wooden sh@@ ri@@ mp@@ s were rough@@ ed , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gr@@ aff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls . &quot;
the family have been converted and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the administration of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that she feared that the apartment is no longer to be repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was for the people here an absolute night@@ mare and I believe that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
&quot; there are many things to consider , since this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is fam@@ ed and their reputation is as well .
&quot; the couple had three sons who had lived in the apartment , and the police said that the terror that had attached the family , street fights with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ sle@@ epers , instruc@@ ting , drug @-@ related , and excessive scre@@ ams , streams and flu@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ on , 47 , whose name stood on the lease agreement , got an arrangement of anti@@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which under circumstances will be demol@@ ished , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found &quot;
&quot; they were tr@@ aded in the estate , in which in the past drugs were tr@@ aded , the wood di@@ ries . &quot;
neighbours said that they saw them on the road and had to be inv@@ oked by the police on a regular basis .
&quot; Corn@@ wall Housing Found@@ ed her and her partner this week by the property , after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to get voluntarily . &quot;
del@@ o@@ fication were ac@@ claimed by light@@ ened neighbors that said their lives to hell .
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; she did not fail to anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - that &apos;s what we are not used !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Neigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years long . &quot;
on the extended side of the house @-@ house there were tr@@ ash and old toys .
&quot; he added : &quot; it is a shame that the les@@ see was ad@@ amed of any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family , as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication is always the last step to consider the Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , as the behavior was extremely difficult and their actions had to be anno@@ yed for their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community that have been cour@@ ageous to us and have provided us the information . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will give a close con@@ sol@@ ation con@@ sol@@ ation and the message that anti @-@ social behavior is not toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they are all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress that is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication on the ground
&quot; the workers of the household administration will now have to spend gar@@ bage , which surround the house &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as sc@@ ales , par@@ ap@@ y and cash in the amount of Â£ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don was awarded a fine @-@ on after being guilty of the pos@@ sessions of a class B in trade @-@ view .
&quot; she claimed the money for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who came in 2013 in an automobile accident . &quot;
&quot; after they were without Ob@@ d@@ ach , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many of the rooms of the house were greeted with gr@@ aff@@ iti .
the police said they will ten@@ ant ten@@ ants who do not stick to their house
Angela C@@ row was shared by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall with that the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication had a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to their house .
&quot; this goes to those who think that they were able to behave without self @-@ esteem , as well as to those who have been damaged by such a behavior , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall is never toler@@ ate criminal , anti @-@ social behavior , which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities . &quot;

tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were displ@@ aced when the aircraft came out of the dark and flew deeply deeply .
&quot; the Portuguese air forces announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3C Ori@@ on flight was on a workout flight , to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ person said that the jet due to the bad visibility was slightly deeper than usual , however per@@ si@@ sted the air forces that safety at no time was at risk . &quot;
&quot; floo@@ ded walls have destroyed this summer parts of the Portuguese forti@@ land , where four people came to death on the island Madeira . &quot;

&quot; the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one @-@ sided finale his comp@@ atri@@ ot , and &quot; front @-@ defense &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.5 % ) . &quot;

bronze went to the Japan of Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese have done it as expected into the game and spread the title among themselves .
it was clear that the third time in a row a Chinese would pick up the single title in the sign of the Five Rings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top level of Olympia was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ã @-@ legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ eing @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang on track were left alone on the record , between the sets and in time outs , they had no co@@ aches to himself . &quot;
&quot; they went back to the ble@@ ach@@ ers , and left their tr@@ ays at a fair competition with each other . &quot;
&quot; the mats until here I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; I had said to it . &quot;
according to the Parti@@ cip@@ her Gold@@ - and silver medal winner with the China Fl@@ ag .
the match itself was unexpected .
Ma had to really fight with his 28 @-@ year opponent only in the first sentence .
&quot; after that , he took the pace in the record and let Z@@ hang down there only a total of 13 points . &quot;
due to the superi@@ ority of Ma he did not develop the expected match .
but nonetheless , nonetheless , there was enough breath @-@ taking ball@@ ad . &quot;
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game of bronze against the 40 @-@ year Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .

Donald Tru@@ mp dre@@ amed â³ SSD problems â³ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the U.S. republi@@ cans is cl@@ ashed away from massive worries , also in traditional Conserv@@ atives states . &quot;
presidential campaign Donald Tru@@ mp is now given weaknesses of his electoral campaign in the former republi@@ can strongh@@ old Utah .
&quot; a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ sp@@ y and self @-@ safe de@@ activ@@ ating mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire as something as concerns vo@@ iced , as correspon@@ dents . &quot;
&quot; after he thre@@ w 16 ri@@ vals within the race &apos;s Republi@@ can camp , then the doubt of his success in the fight for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah &quot; said Tru@@ mp in front of evangel@@ ik@@ al Christians , which he asked for support in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; to blame , false reports of his candidates , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media . &quot;
Republi@@ can strongh@@ olds
Utah is normally a safe bank for the republi@@ cans .
&quot; a survey of Surv@@ ey@@ USA from June , said Tru@@ mp and his assistant by Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , as well . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tru@@ mp in front , but not by the distance that are common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state . &quot;
compared to Arizona and Georgia .
&quot; in an interview of the Senate CN@@ BC answered Tru@@ mp on the question , how he wants to stop the rise of Cl@@ int@@ ons : &quot; &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and if left : this will be &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
&quot; he is doing nothing else , as &quot; the truth to tell . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , whether in order , Tru@@ mp says . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to Press@@ views , the party of Tru@@ mp intends to cut funds for the support of his election campaign , he should not present any better ren@@ unci@@ ations . &quot;
instead of taking the candidates of the Republi@@ can engage in the Congress more deeply under the arms .
Olympia : tri@@ ster fraud for D@@ oping Test
the I@@ OC wants to set a discipline .
Ken@@ y@@ as Ath@@ ath@@ l@@ ete is threatened with the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after a fraud attempt on a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a coach home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee dealt with as soon as possible to set a discipline &apos;s commission to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function had communicated that the former Spr@@ inter and today Coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village had given a urine test under the name of the 800 meters of Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this is the team@@ line K@@ eni@@ as reported by the dop@@ ing contro@@ l@@ le@@ urs .
the World Bank IA@@ AF has asked the I@@ OC for information about the case in order to str@@ ingent one &apos;s own investigations as a IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures in the I@@ OC the IA@@ AF will make a review , &quot; says it in a IA@@ AF explanation . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the dop@@ ing station and has issued himself as Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as Chief de mission Stephan A@@ wrap So@@ i . &quot;
&quot; he was in possession of the ac@@ credit@@ ation of athletes , who stood on the list for training controls in the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency . &quot;
Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was in Beijing World Cup @-@ Fourth than 800 meters in 2015 .
four days before the Ken@@ yan &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics was drawn from the Rio Olympics .
he should have informed about cash payments from his country on increasing dop@@ ing tests .
&quot; according to media reporting , he is said to be arrested in Nairobi on his return at the International Airport . &quot;
Kenya stands by the I@@ OC for many dop@@ ing applications for some time under special observation .
&quot; in the announcement of the more than 2000 D@@ oping rules in front of the Rio Olympics , we have noted that particularly Ath@@ l@@ ete from Kenya and Russia were taken into sight . &quot;
&quot; the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had done much pressure on the African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a working order system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic @-@ beginning .
&quot; subsequently , the W@@ ada took home from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing fight against the rules of W@@ ada . &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a great runner @-@ nation .
the Ath@@ ath@@ l@@ ete of the country won the majority of medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
a series of tel@@ ev@@ isions of the ARD have always been re@@ pro@@ ving that in Kenya D@@ oping means are easily accessible and there should be a significant ment@@ ality of the sport bet@@ rot@@ ary .
&quot; I@@ OC &apos;s member Richard Po@@ und asked for a similar study in Kenya , as he had finished in the Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; it could be proven that in this sport , cover @-@ wide and systematically Ged@@ opt . &quot;
&quot; as a result of Russia Ath@@ ath@@ l@@ ete , we were then excluded from the summer playing . &quot;

the artistic director Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the Musical into the temple of the Klassik and filled themselves with the role of Mary a teen@@ ager .
&quot; in the orchestr@@ al @-@ dig the Sim@@ Ã³n Bol@@ Ã­@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ ian Di@@ ri@@ gen@@ ten Gust@@ avo Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he warm@@ ed . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American shaped .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we have really enjoyed Bern@@ st@@ eins music in our blood !
in this instances of Bart@@ oli plays a older Lady .
she reminds with melanchol@@ y in her lovers with Tony while the younger Mary plays and danced .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so it is clever , of course also na@@ Ã¯@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character , which I was as a Roman @-@ in , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the Opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is a tremendous amounts of funding .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
rigi@@ d is for him a necessity .
&quot; one sees it in each of its movements , in his bub@@ ble , it is his life ! &quot;
there is such a huge chance of sharing this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , this is at all very important ! &quot;
for the American director Philip World Championship . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; state @-@ of @-@ date : &quot; in this piece it deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have gone to the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans had gone to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want it . &quot;
&quot; they are the same issues , and they are just as expres@@ sive as it was at that time . &quot;
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
&quot; London &apos;s n@@ anny , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school@@ ma@@ ids that left London last year to join the IS , eventually died in Syria . &quot;

&quot; it was alleged to have been killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ wark of the group in the country , I@@ TV News in Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died shortly after they had given birth to her family , after they had caused the war to leave country and to return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good in it is - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks involved in a war area - people prevent it to ever meet that decision , &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
in February 2015 Sult@@ ana and two other debts in the East of London put a plane to Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sult@@ ana family has been told that they have married a IS@@ IS fighters in Syria - and in a few months to the wi@@ dow .

&quot; in the middle term , there could be even &quot; some hundreds of thousands , &quot; believes the allies of Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; because of the hard work of the Turkish president Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish community of Germany expects a mass evasion to Germany . &quot;

&quot; whoever does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed caffeine , by the way also the Kem@@ alist and sec@@ ul@@ aries , &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un , Chairman of the GÃ¼@@ len @-@ based foundation dialogue and education , the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reported by calling on figures of the Federal Ministry of State , the Turks were already faced with the coup the largest group of the asylum seek@@ ers in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; to the point of June 30 , this would have been 11,@@ 386 people and therefore almost 29 per cent of all accepted as an asylum ( 39.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
in this survey cannot be found before war , poverty or an effective angl@@ ement . &quot;
&quot; asylum obligations under the Basic Law are solely politically , thus of the government , individually persec@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; then go , where it does &quot;
&quot; strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not get anything from the summer electoral campaign , and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ p@@ hal@@ ia should not choose the tag . &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the country elections will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; because blocks of so far it is not : summer holidays , heat and a convention competition . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the electoral campa@@ ign@@ ers , are on holiday . &quot;
&quot; most vac@@ ation@@ ers , those in the country are on Us@@ edom , R@@ Ã¼gen or Hid@@ den@@ see on the road , are not allowed to choose the country &apos;s day . &quot;
&quot; practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers who lifts the posters , bal@@ lo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , and divide by the end of votes , only mills . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the electoral and final F@@ eri@@ ent@@ ag , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has once again to give a campaign against its people in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; the hot stage , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ar@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be responsible for his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clear in surveys behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
exciting how strong new@@ bies Af@@ p cuts and what remains at the end of the ex@@ ali@@ tion@@ able .
&quot; cel@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tr@@ usive electoral campaign , can be seen by his grand@@ children . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the land , spread the ros@@ es and chat a little with the people , just as it is already his legendary @-@ incar@@ nation predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , sea @-@ arms has got arms and gives ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel the blame for the blos@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; We manage the &quot; &quot; to rise up the rise of right hem@@ at@@ uli@@ sts , which is likely to cost the lovely position now . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its top rated data , the Interior Lor@@ enz Caf@@ fier , has already seen how it is when you make at the wrong time at the right place of election campaign . &quot;
she has invited twice the ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel and invited ; Merkel Par@@ ag@@ ull @-@ Circle is located in the Nor@@ the@@ ast .
&quot; but the target group did not vote , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ p@@ hal@@ ia , Berlin and Saxony as Meckl@@ en@@ burger and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority from other states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it is a p@@ ity either to listen to someone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the North @-@ CD@@ U disp@@ ens@@ ed largely to the usual election levels on market spaces and most m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and air bal@@ loon . &quot;
&quot; that means Kok@@ ert , play only a &quot; minor role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also has noticed that you have hem@@ med the base in the countryside , that it must be very sensi@@ bly to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; you are on the left side of the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any case in the countries of the country . &quot;
&quot; the advice of the CD@@ U electoral campa@@ ign@@ ing to its co@@ si@@ ders is also self @-@ exposed : &quot; you must then go where it is w@@ eh@@ doing , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden W@@ ed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because a lot is standing on the game , S@@ ella has now called its SPD a particularly committed electoral campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last recently with 22 percent behind Partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just below the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD still gained clear with 35,@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small part@@ ying with seven percent in the poll@@ s , can be made to make the leap into the land day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue of the holidays @-@ Not a modern virtue and rel@@ ay its electoral campaign large @-@ owned by the internet .
&quot; online electoral campaign , &quot; it is called the President Claudia MÃ¼ller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green al@@ arm@@ chair will explore for indigenous pac@@ ed among the tourists . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top can@@ did@@ acy , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Moravian lakes and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
&quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; El@@ bow in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ San@@ ation : speakers suffer from blocking
&quot; to the speed , with which the B will be executed 27 , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the building work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and only end against 20 o &apos;clock , there is always praise . &quot;
&quot; they made all quite z@@ ack@@ ly , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff by the Jet @-@ gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no hiding place .
&quot; the construction site could be postpon@@ ed at weekends as scheduled to the half time , until the end of October everything will be ready . &quot;
&quot; the representative will also be praised for the construction works , for example when it comes to the establishment of containers . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday to the south and the block of the Asp@@ erg@@ straÃe in Of@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted , and thus also the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg , the traffic situation within the place has relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now move from Of@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 again .
alternative traffic through the place seems to be returned .
&quot; there were partly considerable complaints , &quot; says the responsible management of the Vice @-@ responsible management of the Vice @-@ President Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach@@ k@@ straÃe , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straÃe , A@@ vel@@ straÃe and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many sc@@ ars sought and more confi@@ ding their navigation than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to make some trucks in residential areas .
&quot; as well , the high speed b@@ umps were not respected , the community called for the measuring vehicle from M@@ Ã¶s@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there have been significant crossing , &quot; says King , who made himself a location on the location of the situation . &quot;
that has already been et@@ ched two or three per minute .
the fastest was with 77 kilometers per hour in the temp@@ o @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
&quot; moved to the site , but it has become more quiet . &quot;
for the busin@@ ess@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the street is now open again .
busin@@ ess@@ men do not have to look for busin@@ es@@ spe@@ ople .
&quot; however , that the B has led 27 @-@ renovation to them with sales revenue , each one is asked to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , for whom the reconstruction has hardly consequences . &quot;
&quot; in the de@@ aler@@ ship Ma@@ ier talks Thomas Sul@@ z of a &quot; &quot; very light drop &quot; , &quot; but also a fact that of course the pro@@ secution is missing . &quot;
the worst exploited are the loc@@ ales along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner , owner of the ste@@ ak@@ house , former crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the hospitality there have been &quot; &quot; hard hit &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it l@@ acked the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ ins . &quot;
we have to be glad about each Euro turnover .
&quot; in excess of 50 percent , the sales fell to &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tr@@ aver@@ aging have returned its operation &apos; to two years .
half of his workers have released it .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half were released , politics would have responded differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , ruling forces JÃ¶rg Schmidt on a request of G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner , whether there might be a financial compensation , otherwise the benefits of the situation on the B 27 Now they also use the dis@@ advantages that result in the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where it is dealt with from the land . &quot;
&quot; with all complaints , G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will be res@@ trained . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family @-@ owned company has been located since 17@@ 15 , he points to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars now ga@@ ze less frequently due to complicated transport management less frequently , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you cannot go over , it is also quite nice . &quot;
&quot; that his tri@@ bal , after the end of the re@@ development work back again , he has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with B@@ SE and bird flu , G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 co @-@ works on his cli@@ ent@@ ele for the biggest crisis , which has experienced its Gast@@ stÃ¤tte in its long history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , this is brutal . &quot;
constantly in the name of the terrorist control of laws is weak@@ ened .
after the recent attacks the interior minister de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨re is now a big security package .
but what has a d@@ ossi@@ er status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist say to all that ?
Thomas de Ma@@ zur@@ Ã¨re gives the Com@@ Ã¶h@@ ner .
&quot; all his proposals are subject to the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist &quot; politically reasonable , &quot; says the Federal Minister with the presentation of his new security packages . &quot;
you do not require anyone .
&quot; others , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
also it takes part in the following .
&quot; as the interior minister he was located in results , and at a &quot; &quot; al@@ located consensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in WÃ¼r@@ zburg , Ans@@ bach and Ans@@ bach presented a little time before he presents his conclusions for the safety of the Republic . &quot;
but they are now all the more extensive .
&quot; some thing is already known , proclaimed : that a new security authorities should take on encrypted communication , is not new . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nor does the fact that Germany must implement several EU guidelines on air passenger data and arms rights . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for the safety authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨re , a second kick @-@ up for proposals which had not been doing so far with the SPD : he wants to put sympath@@ ath@@ ering for terrorism groups under punishment and jiha@@ dists with double citizenship the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he still consider this to be reasonable and also demanding nothing , what is not a chance at the co@@ ali@@ er partner . &quot;
a few new ideas presented de Ma@@ zur@@ Ã¨re .
they are partly in himself : he is planning quick@@ set for deport@@ ations and more possibilities to det@@ ention people from deport@@ ation .
&quot; refugees trying to get into the land deliberately , are to leave their smartphone and disclose social media accounts for a safety review . &quot;
&quot; in case of kno@@ wers for ex@@ ee@@ able asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse than so far - such , the crimes commit or their papers deliberately throw away their identity . &quot;
some of them is political and legal .
&quot; some even un@@ balanced , and leaves questions open . &quot;
&quot; and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of ge@@ dul@@ ens , for example - raises the question : what does this have to do with safety and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨re , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subject of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it is not possible to say that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and WÃ¼r@@ zburg refugees were .
&quot; in addition , many people have worried about the high refugee camps concerned about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that have deeply dealt with , have now also failed to cl@@ ing in election times even in election times . &quot;
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
&quot; attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in WÃ¼r@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach .
the in@@ security is great .
&quot; and yes , it is a electoral campa@@ ign@@ ing . &quot;
Union and SPD can focus on inner security in an increasingly position on position .
in the last few days we were talking about the two parties .
&quot; only a gar@@ sti@@ ger dispute over the facilities of the Federal Police boats , then on a security policy @-@ collection of some Uni@@ ons , in which the vines also calls a Bur@@ ka pro@@ hibition and a return of the double citizenship . &quot;
de Ma@@ zur@@ Ã¨re is also here about irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able notes .
from a recur@@ ring from the double pass he kept nothing .
we have enjoyed the discussion in Germany .
you can re @-@ di@@ gest it is not meaningful .
and at a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether his own package is un@@ constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist . &quot;
there &apos;s a lot in what could worry about war .
&quot; however , the SPD is trying to argue with inner security on the topic of inner security . &quot;
&quot; Sig@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes first times by talking @-@ willingness and said , &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything to contribute to improving security . &quot;
still comes Volkswagen glimp@@ ses by .
despite Dies@@ el@@ sk@@ and@@ als climbing the pay@@ roll @-@ up worldwide .
&quot; however , not in all markets it runs smoothly . &quot;
&quot; when re@@ traction , there is a vor@@ tex of a concept . &quot;
Volkswagen starts to start the first half of the year in the first half @-@ year .
&quot; Europe &apos;s largest highway , in the previous year , despite the diesel passenger , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ run markets continue to advance a plus . &quot;
&quot; but in July the brand @-@ brand VW , especially in Western Europe and remains un@@ loaded with the overall sales , as the companies listed in the D@@ ax company . &quot;
&quot; sold in the world for the last year , VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China is the second most important market , sales of 14 percent were below the previous year . &quot;
in the Heimat@@ markt Germany s@@ ack@@ ages the delivered to almost a Six@@ th .
brand@@ ed JÃ¼rgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weak@@ est figures from the July first of all on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , it has been in some core markets by &quot; changing economic conditions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um was deb@@ ited from the EU , explained a speaker . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the car@@ bure@@ tor was first escal@@ ating , is also further a minus to be@@ ech . &quot;
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; in total , the mainly affected Hau@@ smar@@ ks of Lower Saxony continues to be read by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an export ratio of 0.7 percent is to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles . &quot;
consolidated name Fred Kap@@ pler was able to continue sales from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time from 5,@@ 904 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software bott@@ ling tests .
&quot; alone in Germany , VW roughly 2.5 million cars has been calling for retro@@ fit into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of conversion , VW , that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after the modification of the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; the drive point of the customers after conversion is a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; reason , legal enemies . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reports , Volkswagen has received its German customers now a guarantee for rounded diesel models . &quot;
this was confirmed last Monday VW @-@ Represent@@ atives in the Federal Ministry of Commerce .
out of the traffic Ministry was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has completed the resolution of my investigation committee and of the KBA . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of this are not accepted , &quot; stated Federal Transport of Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance after the retro@@ fit did not take deterior@@ ations and have unchanged all the data @-@ relevant vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not how it would be in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; in the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen the possibility of providing customers for example a half year after changing , using an engine harm to a workshop , even if the damage could do nothing , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; in the customer &apos;s interest , it is important to avoid any other damage , which has nothing to do with the de@@ plor@@ able , to ensure uncertainty as to possible warranty conditions . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; does not use . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ bel G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from wealthy pig@@ lets in future pen@@ di@@ as - as a second Institute in Germany .

&quot; this fee does not require the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ database G@@ mund , from September to retail and corporate clients for deposits of 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or F@@ ed accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next hundred million will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
it has been around 40 million Euros that could be with@@ drawn from one day to the other and which he could not be able to commerci@@ alise it .
&quot; they lie with me on the market account and cause 0,@@ 4 percent costs , &quot; said the chief executive . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lay down for each million 4,000 euros . &quot;
the cost is now on after the principle of bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy .
&quot; the cash can be easily observed in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ bel , would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; I have experienced four inci@@ dents , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the ban@@ quet . &quot;
most customers could have comprehen@@ sion and altern@@ ate in other plant forms .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy target caused considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; it alone is possible to carry , either &quot; &quot; business is permanently not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their fees for con@@ duction , credit cards or wire transfers . &quot;
&quot; with pen@@ di@@ ets for deposits of three million euros , the Thur@@ ingi@@ an Community and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ ja Alten@@ burger Land has made head@@ lines with their skat@@ ro @-@ Fili@@ ale 2014 head@@ lines . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , main business leaders of the banking Association , said : &quot; we do not expect private clients have to pay off income for deposits , the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks have much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a cliff , which is equipped with a slightly vol@@ umin@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank if they are free of charge . &quot;

&quot; the region is known as well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; currently , the cooperative association of Bavaria &quot; are currently no further banks known to charge a compensation for deposits of private clients , &quot; said speaker . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Bundes@@ federation of German people and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ Ã¶h@@ lich , had declared the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ atives is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is hard , and it thre@@ aten the migration of investors to competitors . &quot;
the customers in Germany will not let this have fallen in the width .
destination plates : who bu@@ ys actually p@@ ile ?
un@@ itary men middle @-@ aged plates .
&quot; before you hur@@ ry to the comm@@ ent@@ ine to so@@ w him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ emp@@ ath@@ ic men , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the en@@ coded re @-@ assessment of gram@@ ophone did not want to welcome a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life no@@ stalgia . &quot;
&quot; those who bought recently have bought a record , are all predic@@ tions after the age of between 45 and 54 . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyers . &quot;
it is also not a horror by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older children &apos;s run@@ ners still retain their feelings more for yourself ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on television , I would follow the camera while in the middle of a busy road in Soh@@ o , a hum@@ ble suit , and wild si@@ p@@ able before I stop my hands and tell a certain determining point as : &quot; &quot; so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let us take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even though the heart of So@@ hos slowly approaches to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill in the buildings where once independent sal@@ es@@ men were resident - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores . &quot;
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera for the next part in which I am standing in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation .
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I by S@@ ister Ray ( data count : two young women , three men middle ages ) , a woman , presum@@ ably a day for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I wonder ? &quot;
&quot; I already estimate &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; these sound @-@ plates , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by email , I am not followed by him ) , dress the walls of his room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he possesses a considerable number of albums and singles , the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records which he did not afford to buy them and buy items that he sold , when he was young and bank@@ rupt . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60 &apos;s , early 70@@ s , which appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things , where I was probably something too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agre@@ es that those who buy the boards should be more intro@@ ver@@ ted and eager to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I do not smoke and I drink not very much . &quot;
this is my L@@ aster .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works by S@@ ister Ray , also believes that many customers who meets the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; he has also noticed a new wave of folks , who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and let him see again their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have managed , people usually have died so as to 1998 or 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom of tr@@ ailers of a particular age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of plates ?
&quot; it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica , to recognize that record stores a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers took off on the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
some fans of fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw himself to the stability of confidential record devices .
&quot; I guess sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the property of material pos@@ sessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says MO@@ Z . &quot;
this is with me as a collector and I think it &apos;s like that with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; fl@@ ax a staff of a record stack .
&quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April was reve@@ aling that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , they have not yet been heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % possess a record player who never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , no record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the report , I would probably look very anxi@@ ous while I have more di@@ lig@@ ned by a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova compact . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at the Sounds of the Universe ( data count : three men middle ages ) has a &quot; &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; &quot; of the cage . &quot;
&quot; someone only recently came here and said , &quot; I do not own a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ ar bur@@ ner plate , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more produ@@ kt@@ on , less musi@@ kl@@ y . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older , who only gradually come out . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , dedicated to the sound@@ boards almost a whole floor , has a b@@ under@@ ed audience , when I deer . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ ager and women middle @-@ ages . &quot;
&quot; even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above @-@ standing shops , Wild Be@@ asts neu@@ ester syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ ter pop instead of experimental bre@@ aches out of the l@@ oud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks bright , but nag@@ ging mental trau@@ mas are hard to envis@@ aged when one stands beside someone 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around a few minutes in the business and looked at the records of the plates available for sale . &quot;
it is rather a window mor@@ tal @-@ bum@@ ble@@ bee than a big one .
&quot; it does not deserve much , so the collecting of plates is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs much .
&quot; it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in other way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; she drives with a ver@@ ted sig@@ h . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
&quot; my last stop is a business , which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; while I give the contact that Je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ p@@ ants to m@@ ust@@ ern , I &apos;ve noticed a group of young teenage girl , who fought for a moment to buy pol@@ ish cameras before a father and his daughter have superior to buy a Cro@@ sl@@ ey disk player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of sheets of Adel@@ e , Jeff Bu@@ ckl@@ ey , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody sees her on - maybe because they are merely purely decorative , some so far from the top that it is impossible to grasp them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry , and some customers could send to the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is not a surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like plates . &quot;
&quot; even when my rep@@ air@@ ings made the results of You@@ Go@@ v , they let , at least in stock items in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record @-@ makers who exist in reality , record stores and in online @-@ research . &quot;
people probably work hard at school or at offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with security not by bus ride through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they ste@@ er the star@@ ing look of an un@@ insi@@ der , 30 @-@ year false moder@@ ator ste@@ er , who has out@@ dated over the shoulders of the middle aged men . &quot;
the manor @-@ shar@@ k is the longest survi@@ vor@@ tex - vide@@ op@@ pres@@ et

&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen , who studied the shar@@ ks , says that the record came with a female , from which it is assumed that there is between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long . &quot;
French dish to rest offer about as@@ br@@ iss of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French judge refused an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , do@@ zens of tent@@ ative shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , living in the thousands of refugees living . &quot;
&quot; in a court hearing this week , the authorities argu@@ ed the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should be authorised to sell 72 pro@@ vis@@ ors , where persons within the camp , from cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services or to sell tea for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that these places should be demol@@ ished because they would be a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and which a fire and san@@ ity concern . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups divided the court with that businesses and restaurants are important , since free meals are offered by the state supported union and other groups , not enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in Lille , decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who operate 72 pro@@ vis@@ ite business , but spatial that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ FranÃ§ois M@@ olla said that the food shops , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just live people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of calm meeting between refugees and volunteers can offer .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the precip@@ itation was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; CafÃ© des Lag@@ ers , which is non @-@ profit and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum seek@@ ers for the hundreds of vulnerable , in@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; CafÃ© . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closing of &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two auxiliary organizations Help refu@@ ge and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants dro@@ wned on Friday , that the number of people living in the jungle @-@ ager living on 9.@@ 000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase in Neu@@ ch@@ Ã¶@@ mm@@ eland during the summer . &quot;

&quot; I honestly say it sincerely , the time passing from yesterday to comment , &quot; said Martin . &quot;
he must analyze peace in peace which reasons may lead to the deb@@ acle .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany Ras@@ er needs to adapt to the next generation of speeds : in different federal states , including in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , particularly effective . &quot;
the futur@@ istic final En@@ forcement of the Vit@@ ronic company from Wiesbaden may be used for example at uns@@ ett@@ led points where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
&quot; for example , on motorway construction sites or to gentle bridges with temporary Tem@@ pol@@ l , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with a stationary bl@@ aster in compliance with speed b@@ umps . &quot;
a lasting mobile building can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery keeps in un@@ interrupted measuring operations five days , the case data is encrypted via a mo@@ dem . &quot;
laser @-@ measurement technology can also be recorded across multiple tracks across multiple tracks .
&quot; variable speed b@@ umps and har@@ b@@ ings according to time , lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
in the highly @-@ driven condition you can move the trailer into the manufacturer by each car with a trailer .
&quot; so that he is not simply cl@@ oned , he is hung in the fair , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and inci@@ dentally disappear also a safe outside cover . &quot;
in addition a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ itzer against destruction .
since 2015 the trailer has been tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also employed .
&quot; even foreign authorities hon@@ ors with the new technique : recently France has 100 pieces of handling , after an order of 150 items last year . &quot;
great Britain took silver in 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold pic@@ ks
&quot; the impressive performance of Britain from 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came in the finals on Thursday evening to a ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle , in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were be@@ aten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ adly stage here in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji distributed a master@@ class in handling , side @-@ stepp@@ ing , desc@@ ending , liner notes and raw strength to win gold - its first Olympics of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was swe@@ eten by the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Great Britain on that day - and they could well be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they sm@@ ote New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the distinct defeat of the boards , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could be returned to them in the final . &quot;
but regardless of that Fi@@ ji in this form would have taken a 15 @-@ man team in order form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it probably will not mean that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal in order to hang around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Chef trainer Ben Ryan , the former chief for England from Wimbledon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago she lost in Ryan any game in the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
&quot; here , they lost only one . &quot;
this fl@@ ap will do it but the progress is ast@@ o@@ unding .
Fi@@ ji began mar@@ vel@@ ous and allowed the attacks of GB@@ s from lots of fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell to and Co. in , when you were running into driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au went over in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wai still turned out another attack on the right corner which he walked . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly accepted the ball .
&quot; a down@@ turn T@@ ackle of Mitchell stops the mountain from Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it has only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute l@@ ete J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner a touch@@ down and there was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
&quot; Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ kick @-@ off , and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half . &quot;
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ted through more weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and rus@@ hed to line to make a goal .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while in GB still da@@ ot@@ ated .
this is how it is .
&quot; GB carried out fundamental changes to the half @-@ time , completed the fi@@ du@@ ce gap ... for the whole four minutes , what was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , till Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran according to a brilliant pause of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran before for a long time in favor of Southern French sul@@ ated , whose fans s@@ angen and danced on the ble@@ ach@@ ers . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i @-@ cake with a further attempt in the last seconds .
the wh@@ ist@@ les sounded that Fi@@ j@@ is h@@ ug@@ ged and in GB k@@ ick@@ y be@@ aten in the lawn .
&quot; earlier this day Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated in the semi @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 , and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a scar@@ ce half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation . &quot;
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ w in the first half to the front but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and recorded a gate among the post in the second half .
&quot; a brilliant Tac@@ tical , by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the profit - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no em@@ ot@@ ting gold than among those games and that wants to hot .
&quot; from the first shut@@ down to the last , 220 hard h@@ ieve , which go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning , found an additional significance in her golden moment at Est@@ acio since Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if it were only the two , which were on the pack , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present as she moved to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the two without a tax @-@ wife in a row that gave the first women in the history of the British sports who laid out on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; your domin@@ ance was absolute , after all their 39.@@ , un@@ written use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes , refl@@ ecting on the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which is not reflected the type of the tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in the Ru@@ ins there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing Hel@@ pers to make the difference , and no one was better than the coach who would not know that day at all , when he was diagnosed with him cancer . &quot;
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
&quot; I have had bladder cancer , the op@@ eri@@ as@@ able , and that did it . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do it , he spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a rather horrible state .
it changed a bit of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck that he was treating early 2014 , out of season , beginning to start out what the break stopped to a minimum in case that in such circumstances the proper term is . &quot;
I needed money so I had to go back soon .
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they told that some steps would be . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; the herd of itself is already a challenge , but it makes it a larger one . &quot;
&quot; in the im@@ min@@ ence of the victory , her first thought of Williams , who spent a nerve rac@@ king in the morning that spent a little more than usual and tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was regarded as captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; I was a emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely difficult , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it is repeated only how much me that means , how much I and Helen have worked for Robin . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would have no one , therefore , a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach of the world . &quot;
I could not have wished for a better person to watch or want a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no races lost in the last five years .
the couple had a hard beat where their opponents could not keep up with .
&quot; even over the past 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark had begun to quit , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve . &quot;
we were very at the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it really is important to not let itself tear .
we had a good start and at the same time we didn &apos;t get out of making something special .
&quot; we did not want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the pair will take a time for one year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she is just want to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that that was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to conc@@ eive that I am an Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ ress . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; it feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years of exempl@@ ary for clarity
&quot; the Managing Director of the water @-@ purpose &quot; V@@ eit@@ ern @-@ stone &quot; , &quot; R@@ up@@ pert GÃ¶@@ ller , continues to retirement . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ al exempl@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small fresh drinking water @-@ pur@@ er as a model for the great water producers .
so it meant some time ago in the original press in a post of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
&quot; little later , the Aqu@@ forum of the Government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken announced the forced association . &quot;
the work of the V@@ eit@@ y stone @-@ group suffered as exempl@@ ary as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this , Ru@@ pert GÃ¶@@ ller , the 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband , was 28 years of age as Managing Director . &quot;
&quot; now , at the age of 65 he was retired in the age of 65 . &quot;
&quot; the drinking water @-@ association with the seat in K@@ ott@@ endorf , community l@@ essen , promotes approximately 150@@ 000 cu@@ bic meters of water and provides approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants per year . &quot;
&quot; member communities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ ch@@ ter , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Baun@@ ach . &quot;
for further towns and municipalities there are water supplies .
&quot; the current chair , Breit@@ brun@@ ner Citiz@@ enship in Ger@@ tru@@ d BÃ¼h@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert GÃ¶@@ ller released in 1985 as a water@@ mark and was appointed Managing Director of the kenn@@ el . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very varied and they extended from the water head @-@ building and maintenance operations , the budget creation , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency sessions on weekends , &quot; said the chair . &quot;
&quot; outstanding events , she called the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property sales in the new well ( 1998 ) and repar@@ ation of farmers , the re@@ development of the high speed control ( 2004 ) , the re @-@ creation of a central computer @-@ control ( 2004 ) , and the divi@@ ding of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there have been no st@@ agnation , and I have always received new innovations because water life is nour@@ ished and pot@@ able water be the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in their Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o , she praised jo@@ wl , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
he has used himself with much heart@@ beats for his water purpose and has lived the water@@ pur@@ ist right for pur@@ pos@@ h as if it were his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , he served as a real practi@@ tioner to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ y stone group at the nit@@ rate of the district Unter@@ fran@@ ken . &quot;
he received a lot of appreciation and praise .
Ru@@ pert GÃ¶@@ ller in turn praised Wasser@@ wart Alf@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him 28 years with him .
he is the best water@@ mark and he was a devoted l@@ cap .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a high point in his view , he marked the fountain hor@@ tic@@ ulture and the re @-@ structured of the tr@@ ays . &quot;
the biggest challenge and the har@@ dest use were the pipe @-@ breaking on the peak of the church on a third of January .
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages were supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; also the care of Neu@@ brunn , one can only be maintained because you filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with lo@@ ops . &quot;
the management of drinking water purpose was handed over to Daniel StÃ¼r@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who follows the succession of Ru@@ pert GÃ¶@@ ller .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old male has happened on Friday at 10.@@ 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ eide ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) to his partner and are fatal .
&quot; the man himself ph@@ oned with us and expressed his livel@@ i@@ hood , &quot; said a polic@@ eman pre@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , after him become publicly visible . &quot;
&quot; now nation@@ wide , because Sven S. could be travelling by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 m tall , mus@@ cular , bra@@ un@@ ed and has a glass . &quot;
by now the police have published a photo of him .
it is however a few years old .
meanwhile the man bears a glass .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still wear the weapon with him so the police .
anyone who looks Sven S. will call the 110 .
the police talks about a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim is born in 1988 , the k@@ iller in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; in LÃ¼beck , the competent police in LÃ¼beck , did not want to make any information about the ather@@ cord or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; however , they confirmed that a man had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a sol@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more we say currently not , &quot; said a polic@@ eman pre@@ in in LÃ¼beck . &quot;
ey@@ e@@ witnesses according to that was a special command ( SE@@ K ) at the Tat@@ ort .
steel - bright spot for German steel industry
the kr@@ isen@@ ge@@ exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains of additional costs in meg@@ acities .
&quot; financial bur@@ dens resulting from the sector from the oil series , are from the table . &quot;
&quot; it remains in the liberation from the Renewable energy industry in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutscher Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Friday ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we finally reached negotiations after two years .
&quot; the European Commission was therefore planned at first to use the steel producer , the gases to generate electricity from the ho@@ cho@@ p to generate electricity for their own consumption . &quot;
the steel industry suffered additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry .
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with competition tri@@ miss@@ ary Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when generators in the steel plants will be replaced , in case of an E@@ EG @-@ transfer by 20 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , this will not be raised in the steel industry . &quot;
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission to make up @-@ the @-@ current .
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the former regulation will be largely determined . &quot;
particular importance have been the successful effort from Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; that is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others need to follow . &quot;
&quot; even in the reform of the emissions legal framework , climate and employment targets are also weak@@ ened , &quot; explained IG Metall @-@ Chief JÃ¶rg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from in@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis 2008 .
last year the situation is exac@@ erb@@ ated than the world &apos;s world @-@ largest producer of China raised in view of the weak@@ est domestic demand mass @-@ coated steel on the world market .
European manufacturers raise Chinese steel @-@ related pricing dump@@ ing .
in the course of this Spring@@ time the situation has something relaxed .
&quot; to the one hand , approved import duties on imports of import , on the other hand , the economic prospects of China turned up in China . &quot;
is still unclear how sustainable is the price of reco@@ vering .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; finally , prices have become more stag@@ nat@@ ched . &quot;
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp wanted to not close the end of the closing of individual works .
&quot; at the German steel industry , about 86@@ ,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel manufacturers in spite of rising prices and increasing orders are cau@@ tious . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less cru@@ de steel than in the previous year , such as the commercial organisation in the Friday sector . &quot;
after a short increase in May the manufactured amount returned from the second month in the row .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is worth two percent below the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association is counting on an improved order of orders with a rising output . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing is doing senior &quot;
&quot; the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp for her whole life : as young girl she was at school chor@@ us , in the teacher course , she used the subject music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a senior choir . &quot;
&quot; singing me - emoti@@ onally and physically , &quot; she describes them . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall living , she says . &quot;
&quot; next door , she does something good for her health and her spirit . &quot;
&quot; because S@@ ingen is identical from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , he says Erhard Hac@@ ete from the German senior . &quot;
&quot; most senior sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people with like @-@ minded people , describes h@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; through regular merger , senior social contacts can establish and maintain . &quot;
&quot; for frequently , social and family structures emerge from age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her chor@@ us : &quot; to speak and organize themselves to the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together .
&quot; sing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says Hac@@ ker . &quot;
because exercise seniors with deep and controlled breathing .
those who call for his lungs are not as fast enough in everyday life .
&quot; even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the German labour @-@ association of the senior organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the common singing had a much higher significance ; it belonged to everyday life , both in the school and in leisure time . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz frequently observed that the singing or hearing of songs in older people have spot@@ ted many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
through lyrics and especially melo@@ dies down herself denied themselves denied by the long past events .
&quot; in singing , the head is also demanded a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
at the same time concentrate on your own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
&quot; older people who live alone , practice not only to concentrate on yourself . &quot;
another positive aspect is the recognition which one lear@@ ns through the singing in chor@@ us means Hac@@ ker .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem is also growing through the singing in choir .
&quot; to show yourself : when I spend a little time for something , I will get better and alert beyond me - this experience strength@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with singing , there is so enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he says , little talent to have . &quot;
&quot; you do not sing alone - at 50 s@@ laughter people , who h@@ ears it , when sometimes a sound goes off ? &quot;
in search of the right offer have seniors different possibilities he says Hac@@ ker .
&quot; singer anyone from the acquain@@ t@@ ances in a senior chor@@ us , one can simply join . &quot;
many cities also provide over@@ views over the cho@@ irs in the area .
&quot; who wants to sing in a church choir , can turn directly to the church or church officers . &quot;
many old @-@ ench@@ irs are also found on the Internet .
&quot; who has no access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help on the internet computer . &quot;
&quot; he would like to sing , should then join a choir , melanchol@@ y h@@ row . &quot;
singing is doing the soul well and has something fre@@ eing - that &apos;s true for every age .
cats react sensitive as a cat at Schre@@ ie of young animals
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hannover which effect the herds of kitt@@ ens up grown animals has on adult animals .
&quot; to her surprise , the male also did not let the males we@@ ars - but they counted themselves in contrast to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arousal of kitt@@ ens at the h@@ ew@@ ing of the little ones .
&quot; they are responding to ten percent faster on the lu@@ te of kitt@@ ens who have found themselves in great distress , such as scientists from the veterinary University and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
K@@ hang@@ over is also responding to the kitt@@ ens of kitt@@ ens - although always the same .
&quot; evi@@ dently the acoustic differences between the h@@ ew@@ ing of less and heavily cur@@ ated young people are either not perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; it is the first author@@ it@@ ant of the study , which was published on this Friday in the journal BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitt@@ ens had distinguished with the ur@@ gency of their help . &quot;
&quot; in total , nine grown @-@ adult and eight que@@ ens from the Ti@@ pp@@ ach of the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; they were played for a ruin of the Little , which were taken for three minutes from the throw @-@ box , and separated from both mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; on the other they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger red kitt@@ ens , which were additionally high @-@ off . &quot;
the researchers consider their results despite the low cost of endurance for failure .
&quot; all females , even those who have not yet had their own offspring , been differenti@@ ated to the hor@@ rors , &quot; said Pres@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned down faster to the l@@ oud@@ speaker to be when this pack of the very arous@@ ed kit@@ ties played .
this ability may possibly be alleged or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males did not react at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the past several times , scientists have already examined the reaction of women and men upon baby puri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; they also showed some studies that women were sensitive to inf@@ ants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , the Bi@@ olog@@ ne@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; g@@ ala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an SÃ¼@@ k@@ r is a football Legend in Turkey .
in Turkey against the one @-@ sti@@ ff football star Hak@@ an SÃ¼@@ k@@ r was en@@ acted .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt to place an important football match in Turkey .
in front of the du@@ el of the Ore Mountains between B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clearly : &quot; business as &quot; is announced .
&quot; already during the suspension of the exter@@ mination after the overthrow of an attempt in July , the government , the everyday life of norm@@ ality would not be affected . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those who are suspected of pre@@ aching the movement of pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah GÃ¼@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , even before the football did not stop . &quot;
against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an SÃ¼@@ k@@ r asked the pro@@ secution .
&quot; according to this results in America , the addi@@ ctions will be accused , a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; SÃ¼@@ k@@ r should be his supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah GÃ¼@@ len who is held responsible by president Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan for the coup . &quot;
&quot; although it is true for 90 days of time until October , in fact the life of most Turks did not affect the life of most Turks but as good as no re@@ perc@@ ussions . &quot;
the night@@ ly &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; on public places all over the country Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for ends .
sports is - as the whole country - split into followers and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club of B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as do not belong to the friends of the President .
&quot; what the Gro@@ s of the Turks , but considering the dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
there &apos;s even the fans - no matter if your heart is propos@@ ing for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as .
at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala &quot; it is especially back to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
his sporting value created the KÃ¶l@@ ner in the past season as proof : with 17 gates and nine Tem@@ plates in all competitions ended the 31 @-@ year @-@ old his first play @-@ time as top@@ scor@@ er of his association .
in the end@@ game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he won the 1 : 0 @-@ winning bu@@ ffer .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; F@@ AN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; it was the best in the square . &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and secured by the team .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appoint season for the record master had an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot;
after the Vor@@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League the &quot; lions &quot; can also be made early in the Europa League .
in the South with Li@@ g it has only reached rank 6 .
the season was not good .
Cup was the only way to gain something .
&quot; this is what we have managed and that is the most important , &quot; &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski said . &quot;
for Master B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as ran the game better .
&quot; above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who was presenting the basis for the 14th title with 26 seasons . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; at the AC of Florence , he had not been bor@@ dered by the AC Florence under the contract and finally known to B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as , after the coup attempt to return , because of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ vacation . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must only say it , &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; club chief Fi@@ cre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; but the storms would have to be ready to rel@@ inqu@@ ish around a third of his on 7.5 million euros every year , &quot; &quot; Or@@ man clear : &quot; &quot; his salary in Florence we cannot pay . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have yet medals and chances of Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was locked twice due to D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa can not start in Rio .
others over@@ took athle@@ tics sc@@ ap@@ ers can only lau@@ gh it - they are fighting in Rio to medals .
&quot; the topic of dop@@ ing is defined as before the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
&quot; the Russian swimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had depos@@ ited after a dop@@ ing @-@ lock her start right shortly before playing , was pushed out in its start ( 100 meter chest ) gr@@ ading and bl@@ aded . &quot;
it offered a sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le scenery : with a super@@ vised smile she was still proud of the hall and had prov@@ oked it with her appearance .
&quot; as fixed , that she will not get gold , the audience broke out into a jubil@@ ate storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are still many more athletes , who attend the Olympic Games in Rio in spite of the dop@@ ing past . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was locked two times because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since his spell the Olympi@@ asi@@ eger of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion is even faster than before , he is over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered as the biggest editor of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ ress and si@@ eben@@ ia World Cup had to sit in 2010 after taking the pain using ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after a surgery I had severe dentistry , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old did not def@@ ends . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 the Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ ress of 2012 , World Championships was tested by 2013 and European Championships from 2010 to 2016 positive on the ver@@ bot@@ al stimulation of Meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ anol . &quot;
Per@@ kovic shot the wis@@ ely up@@ take and was locked up six months .
the four wid@@ est wor@@ ms this year go to the account of the large gold fav@@ ors .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics and two @-@ time world master over 400 m , was tested positive and 21 months was blocked . &quot;
&quot; a means for penis enlargement has been responsible , led tre@@ k . &quot;
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the fastest male in the world .
&quot; I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ throw , Belarus ) : probably barely any ath@@ l@@ ete have been detected so many medals . &quot;
&quot; so , T@@ ich@@ on lost his world championship title from 2005 nine years later , after having been observed with him testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing . &quot;
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 for ster@@ oid @-@ D@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone cont@@ emp@@ t .
&quot; also , the Bronze medal at the Olympic Games in 2008 received it back because of a jud@@ g@@ ural of the International Sports Tribunal . &quot;
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is top two of the world tr@@ ack@@ listing .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong Kong ( 20 km ) , China ) : the World D@@ anc@@ ellor and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May , but must still launch in Rio . &quot;
at the 29 year old world championship in the world were found evidence of taking an approved supplement device that dropped the lock of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency W@@ ada and ran already on July 13 .
bom@@ ben@@ terrorism in Thailand - Austrian in@@ ju@@ red - Multiple T@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand reson@@ ates with the woman in contact , said the speaker of the State Department , Thomas Schn@@ Ã¶@@ ll , Fri@@ day@@ . &quot;
&quot; they suffered in@@ ch@@ unds and have been treated in the hospital , but I have already left them again . &quot;
your visit@@ ation is scheduled for early September .
&quot; whether from the other explo@@ sions on the holi@@ d@@ island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on are also Austrian citizens , be still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the State Department of the State shall stand in contact with local authorities , so crazy . &quot;
&quot; at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , H@@ in were first explo@@ ded to a district of two bom@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police a Tha@@ il@@ Ã¤nder@@ in was killed and about 20 people been in@@ ju@@ red , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning again two jumps went high , according to the authorities a further person was killed . &quot;
even from Ph@@ u@@ ket there was also an bom@@ bs in the morning .
during det@@ on@@ ation near the near holi@@ day@@ makers popular bathing @-@ driven Pat@@ ong was in@@ ju@@ red by police information a taxi driver .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country then a further bom@@ b which had an urban def@@ ender .
the spr@@ int is according to the authorities in a flo@@ wer@@ stand in front of the Re@@ four of the coast police in the air .
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga demanded and tr@@ g on the south @-@ west coast , as well as Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on on the southeast @-@ coast several in@@ die . &quot;
&quot; from a connection to the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , it meant . &quot;
&quot; the Bom@@ ben@@ att@@ em@@ ate carry the same manuscript , &quot; said Mr@@ eg@@ ener@@ al Dan@@ ai C@@ meth@@ yl@@ ee Fri@@ day@@ early in front of journalists . &quot;
we assume that this is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express itself to possible motives - probably , however , it is however about the acts of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern among the attacks which is typical for the bom@@ bs of the Bom@@ ben@@ att@@ at@@ as separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police said , on the other hand , the attacks did not exist in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is just local sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
it is rather possible that the bom@@ bs placed from opponents of the domin@@ j@@ unt@@ a military j@@ unt@@ a .
the authorities could have received secrecy in the past days of secrecy in the south of the country - although they were not informed of the exact time and places .
still unclear which group behind the attacks .
&quot; the police expressed its officials across the country , security relating to important government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ bs in Thailand , but they mostly do not judge against tourists . &quot;
&quot; in Hua H@@ in , is a palace that was used over the years of Tha@@ il@@ &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Adu@@ ly@@ ade@@ j . &quot;
&quot; after the course of this species , the Austrian Foreign Ministry is recommended to serve the Austrian Foreign Ministry on his homepage , the instructions of the Thai safety authorities . &quot;
&quot; high safety risks ( security level 3 ) used for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; to disputes between security and Muslim population , there are not necessary journeys to travel to these provinces before any necessary journeys . &quot;
increased safety risks ( security level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were closing a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the military j@@ unt@@ a .
this sp@@ ects the military has a major impact over the years to come .
&quot; Jun@@ ta &apos;s boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said , the bom@@ bs were an attempt to sti@@ p@@ ate chaos , while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military unt@@ a , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , keeps itself a good opportunity to have led the kingdom again to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , it is also not able to have managed the military to get a handle in the extreme south of the country for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
just a year ago in Bangkok the attack was killed at a popular Hin@@ du @-@ shr@@ ine 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is in the sight of the Federal Ministry for Constitutional Protection .
after several nation@@ als the constitu@@ ar@@ cher in the Bund defended the group under observation .
&quot; we see in the &quot; identity movement &quot; cl@@ ue for aspirations for the free democratic basic regulation , &quot; said Constitutional Protection Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German press agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , the migrants of other Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist fashion . &quot;
that is why we are now watching the movement well .
&quot; the &quot; identity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it is applied against &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ultur@@ al @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controll@@ able mass migration &quot; &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Stalin in nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ WÃ¼rttemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; already . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority developed closely with the state of the state . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; identity movement &apos; try to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; generally try to speak the extre@@ mi@@ sts , they speak with anti @-@ young speech , often with p@@ opp@@ ings music . &quot;
the Islam@@ ists are just as right of extreme extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is no concrete advertising for one &apos;s own cause .
the propaganda will appeal to the people emotional .
young people are in a special way pr@@ one .
this is dangerous .
&quot; finally , from several federal states there have been reports of &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; with Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any findings . &quot;
&quot; in the constitu@@ ent manner , possible contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the particular party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals , the extrem@@ ist are changing and so fighting extrem@@ ist . &quot;
it is imperative that such people have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; looking at the clear increase of legal crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee camps , Ma@@ ate , he would not talk about new law in this context . &quot;
but we found in recent years that it can give right @-@ to @-@ life structures .
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the &apos; Fri@@ aler group .
&quot; it can be quite that other legal group@@ ings or small groups form , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee centres , or attack from other right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ ties are planned . &quot;
a nation@@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of rect@@ @-@ ror@@ ism is not recognizable .
the existing groups were on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; concerned , M@@ ate spoke about that a lot of over@@ gri@@ ps went to the account of people who were not in front of the right scene in front of us . &quot;
this is the worrying .
&quot; many of the Tat@@ ry at asylum seek@@ ers were not previously known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated , offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed criminal off@@ ences , who previously had nothing at the hat , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or elected by CD@@ U , SPD or left , which however must have radi@@ cal@@ ised by right @-@ right wing mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always determine the Olympi@@ oni@@ ks or world debate the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the brave presence of RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer playing in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight swimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly , that he was no longer able to see in the TV pictures . &quot;
it just disappeared - no matter how far the cut was chosen .
in social networks Hab@@ it then became the vir@@ als interval .
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a resi@@ dual of 48 seconds ended and won the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; but it was rather its not straight spor@@ ty figure , which attracted attention to international media attention . &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still takes part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special start@@ up from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub@@ ordin@@ ated countries more known .
&quot; as in Ethiopia , most sports@@ men walk , have just wanted to make something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te turns out for the big race .
quickly the first names came round .
some media printed it as &quot; RO@@ BEL of the W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in adaptation to a &quot; &quot; prosperity &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ ids &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; made him funny . &quot;
&quot; his time , he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of Fre@@ isti@@ l , played no part . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also pulled .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i for medi@@ al attention .
memorable was the performance of the Flo@@ at@@ atorial Guinea when he had to compete for over 100 metres in Fre@@ is@@ atorial Guinea .
fr@@ ene@@ tic was buried m@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i at that time .
&quot; the beginning of 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned first eight months before Olympia and had never taken such a long distance before the competition . &quot;

&quot; if in future , the market research is still going to be still unclear . &quot;
&quot; in cont@@ ention circles , it was on Friday , with the shareholders , last had the disappointment about the continuing successes of the years ago experienced restructuring . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K point since 2011 .
&quot; but the fruits of the restructuring are still not seen after 5 years , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; given the last bad Gf@@ K business , each stroke will become un@@ quiet at some point . &quot;
&quot; if this would be the case at BMW , this would also be the quot@@ a . &quot;
the company had not able to stop its loss in the preceding quarters in the second quarter of 2016 .
&quot; with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales fell by 6.9 percent below the level of the comparable pre @-@ year figure . &quot;
&quot; in the first half of the year , sales of EUR 7@@ 21,@@ 2 million Euro increased by 3.4 per cent . &quot;
&quot; above all , the profit in the second quarter mainly charged the firm value of the company in the face of its difficult economic situation . &quot;

accidents - Bus non@@ slip into Kar@@ pac@@ z in Gr@@ aben : eight wounded
during an accident of a travel@@ bus with 43 seniors as passengers travelling on Thursday in Kar@@ pac@@ z ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ me ) eight people have been viol@@ ated .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries and divided the police with them .
&quot; the 66 years old driver of the bus from Eisen@@ ach had to sp@@ ade her details according to the opposite bar@@ aster , partly on the counter@@ f@@ rail . &quot;
&quot; the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , like a speaker in the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ades get the in@@ mates .
six b@@ ail@@ out cars and a staff car came to in@@ genu@@ ity on the national road 2 .
the in@@ final travelers were returned from a regular bus back to the Kar@@ pac@@ z district P@@ ew@@ sum .
&quot; here , you should wait for a replacement of the travel company . &quot;
investig@@ ators demanded the trucks and possible witnesses to get themselves in the police .
&quot; the fees per ann@@ u@@ km@@ eter wast@@ ew@@ ater will be available from 1 October 2016 for the area of se@@ wage plant / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 instead , for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( up to now 2.@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
at the plant in Az@@ endorf the wast@@ ew@@ ater fee will increase later once again if appropriate correction measures should be necessary .
after a covered lime calculation the se@@ ater price is then at 4.@@ 37 euro per cu@@ bic meters .
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ hÃ¤user ( CS@@ U ) reported , was noted during the approval of the budget by the rural district of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these wast@@ ew@@ ater cuts . &quot;
&quot; in Kas@@ endorf market , the market remains committed to providing a legal basis to operate the facilities . &quot;
&quot; from 1st of October 2016 , citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ ar , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg have to take deeply into the po@@ ck@@ et@@ book . &quot;
the tom@@ ers are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Chairman , Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the panel , was necessary to re @-@ change the fees for se@@ wage systems of the market community . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ covers from the previous calendar period will be offset . &quot;
&quot; the gra@@ zing bones was founded as well as with all three se@@ wage systems around relatively small establishments with very low wast@@ ew@@ ater treatment , between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; thus , due to the limited basis of the basis for example , there would have a effect for necessary repairs of several thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the wast@@ ew@@ ater treatment in all three machines is easily declined . &quot;
&quot; in the past Kal@@ cul@@ ation period , in all three facilities , were not least due to their age , restoration and repar@@ ations in a significant extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plant for Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p nearly 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that in the se@@ wage system Az@@ endorf had to be replaced the mechanical ventilation system due to damage .
&quot; in the p@@ umping station world , the nearly 20 years old convey@@ ors had to be over@@ hau@@ led and in the pond system Lop@@ p had to be installed after nearly 20 years of operating the first cl@@ asp and an additional capacity option to be able to keep the water legal requirements in future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the advanced super@@ vis@@ ing and maintenance costs came into account in accordance with the new cal@@ cul@@ ation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which during the previous lim@@ estone in the years 2011 / 2012 are considerably below the current level . &quot;
&quot; stone houses made clear that in the low wast@@ ew@@ ater in the three machines take up the expenses for the operation and maintenance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; thus , additionally , Schmidt , the market share of large entertainment costs in the past 20 years is spar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ arious , especially as you cannot bro@@ aden the utility area of the se@@ wage system of Fries@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal for these plants , because it is about defic@@ it@@ ational facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria were made in July 1 % on a monthly basis .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) , and the first above zero since October last year , considered positive 0.2 % . &quot;
the annual average de@@ flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured by the CP@@ I -@@ 0,8 % .
&quot; consumer prices in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1,0 % . &quot;
inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.6 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , compared to pre @-@ month , the following groups of consumer goods were observed : food and non @-@ endemic drinks ( 1.9 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.@@ 3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0,@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices were falling in clothing and shoes ( 2,@@ 2 % ) ; Mo@@ bili@@ ar , appliances , and rout@@ in@@ ew@@ art@@ es ( 0,5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the prices stayed in front of alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; Anim@@ ated Eff@@ ect as Asian caric@@ ature
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e inspired but some observers say that it is uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel against races .
&quot; using his filter@@ tool , it enables Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already borders the absur@@ dum@@ my . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or figure that could be of a Roy Lich@@ ten@@ stein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ brid@@ ged , independent aer@@ ob@@ struc@@ tive tools that have more than 30 million improved sel@@ f@@ men per day . &quot;
all mis@@ steps will go to the public .
&quot; snap@@ chat filters have drawn up in the past , in which they were accused , in which they were circum@@ scri@@ bed that the app would be more disturbing or white skin as beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when this week he proposed a filter that gave them pun@@ ches , false teeth and dis@@ car@@ ded che@@ eks , there are some critics a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow @-@ face . &quot; &quot;
they asked whether this repeated contro@@ versy is to be a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
&quot; the news and the indi@@ gn@@ ation have been widely used on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat , that it might have the feature disabled . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was meant to be hom@@ age to Ani@@ me characters and not as a caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; out@@ si@@ ders , the r@@ appro@@ ch@@ ement experienced , rec@@ alled the filter of hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ Ã©s . &quot;
others made the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean @-@ American student , whose twe@@ et had been widely used for the photos that the filter &quot; hur@@ ting and kn@@ er was said unpleasant . &quot;
&quot; she added that &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very res@@ ign@@ ant Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot;
&quot; it shows that the filter is not too cau@@ tious , but that the con@@ ges@@ tion was drawn into the extreme @-@ value . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per@@ wire .
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diver@@ gence and integration fight , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are in the matter of race than their older counter@@ f@@ ist - could expect more of it to sensi@@ bilities .
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filter@@ ing a picture generated that for a user , it &apos;s much more difficult that such things were un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Zh@@ u said in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Zh@@ u decided to work as a product home and engineering work for medium to delete her Snap@@ chat account , asking others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an attachment for medium and in a phone interview , she told that they believe that rac@@ ev@@ ant controversi@@ es have a lack of diversity among the settings in the settings in Snap@@ chat . &quot;
Zh@@ u criti@@ ci@@ zed the big part white , only male leadership and ended its attachment with a has@@ ht@@ ag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; the Chinese American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say against it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat has largely un@@ answered un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish figures for the diversity of its employees and indicates its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , it l@@ acked Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to an speaker , the company has recently hired a personnel responsible which focuses on suppres@@ sed population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Zh@@ u told him they won her Snap@@ chat Account and added , &quot; I ask myself whether they need more users like us to say that that is not o.@@ k@@ . &quot;
military kidn@@ apping IS@@ IS intelligence information ; provides committee of Congress
&quot; the members of the United States Central Command has changed in the right to record an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual condition occurred on the ground against the so @-@ called Islamic State of Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the provisional report created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Defence Committee , Secret Services Committee , and of the Wehr@@ Ombud@@ com@@ mit@@ es , reported by major dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret Services , who reported how for@@ ated their en@@ ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; message information collected from high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ mander is typically represented regularly , a pos@@ ses@@ sive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions on site could have had and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer , when bad analyses of our political leaders are presented , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ cans Member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the leaders in the Cent@@ Com range to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ pages report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces .
&quot; although there is no direct indication that indicates that government pres@@ pointed under Obama statements have given the reports to change the reports , how an@@ al@@ ysts are exposed to the pressure of their laws , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic state , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of the year 2015 many Central Command Rel@@ eases , statements and statements prior to Congress were clearly positive when it fulfil@@ ment the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com appe@@ als publicly known that a military conquest of Muslims earlier in April or May 2015 could begin . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ cans of Con@@ gres@@ s@@ ors from K@@ ansas , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of the year 2014 until the middle of the year 2015 , the Heads of Central Command has changed the re@@ imb@@ urs@@ ed reports to play the danger from IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the republi@@ cans called the Task Force ins , after they were used to worry about the mani@@ pulation of reports to the Islamic State . &quot;
the report published on Thursday will continue to be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation will continue .
&quot; in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the general in@@ spec@@ tions of the Ministry of Defence . &quot;
&quot; democratic members of the Advisory Board , published on Thursday their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com had created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of in@@ dem@@ nific@@ ent en@@ ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , one of the highest str@@ ac@@ ulate democr@@ at in Com@@ fort@@ ee , Member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Ship , published in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Ship , &quot; bog@@ ged the publication of subsequent reports , &quot; claimed the morality of the an@@ al@@ ysts , and &quot; gives a little space for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Bo@@ ats and Democrats agreed to have no evidence on a interference of the White House with the Cent@@ Com an@@ al@@ ysts as regards the &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Beast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by investig@@ ators from the General Staff of the Pentagon , who were recorded by complaints from Cent@@ Com an@@ al@@ ysts . &quot;
&quot; L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a spokes@@ person of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment any reports of Congress while the investigation of the General Staff are still in progress . &quot;
&quot; but he also believed that &quot; experts sometimes have different opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a contro@@ versy of discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigation on the question of a successful a@@ erial campaign led by an American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; the alleg@@ ations of the last year , however , have raised the question to which President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest @-@ en@@ ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; criticism concerning the en@@ cyclop@@ edia about the Islamic State remind of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , looked forward to the recommendations of many an@@ al@@ ysts on the recommendations of many an@@ al@@ ysts in Iraq and had little time on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker according to the statement of government proposals made that contrary to the statements by the Islamic State against the refin@@ ement of the terrorist group , since these provisional refin@@ eries were put into operation , since these tent@@ ative refin@@ eries were put into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s , dam@@ aging Command , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure because of his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the USA won fourth Match in the field @-@ hock@@ ey of women , a show@@ down with the UK . &quot;
&quot; a day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 triumph over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field @-@ hock@@ ey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that skill@@ fully won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , she could not remember that have ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I am not among the people who kept their goals in mind .
&quot; however , it knows however : the female players are at 4 @-@ 0 in the oly@@ mp@@ ic competition , and are in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place that will remain un@@ fought after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last round of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which the two teams will achieve the first and second place within their group . &quot;
the first @-@ placed will take a little bit longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
&quot; as always the game may go on Saturday , Americ@@ an@@ men have triggered a surprising work by their success story , four years after they landed in the past London games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time a hock@@ ey place in his hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a nation@@ alist of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , as it was not able to qualify for the Ka@@ der . &quot;
then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team went wrong .
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , Trainer of the National Team , and thus began to turn things to better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work of work in London that we have now .
we have carried out the pack completely ro@@ aming .
on Thursday night B@@ am opened the ri@@ pe in the first half of the game with a back@@ cover from the near @-@ area .
&quot; India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed herself surprisingly smoothly and kept the playing position from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , till he took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; it carried out a spr@@ int with the flat ball on the left side , then moved into the center and l@@ up@@ lift the ball to the gate for the Americ@@ an@@ men to get a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book one door in each of the previous games until now . &quot;
it has a run .
as well as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ oline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , as late it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are consistently argu@@ ably , and in@@ es@@ capable of having a rapid stag@@ gering between competition and quest . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if the oly@@ mp@@ ic F@@ ack@@ el itself would be a burning st@@ angle , that is from the w@@ rist@@ watch to the swi@@ mmer for the tri@@ ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; you can not turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in the queue in the coffee shop , without having Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the argument between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there are Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s warm with gr@@ m@@ ples , could well be given under these known names that were sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if he would be a swi@@ mmer , Tur@@ ner or even f@@ ender . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the oly@@ mp@@ ic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold . &quot;
the oly@@ mp@@ ic flame is not lit immediately every event .
&quot; further from the center , partially in the shade are the sports that are not widely recognized : air@@ brush , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the ni@@ p@@ ples and may be there for long .
&quot; but if I feel modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the tramp@@ oline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ oline jump has been an oly@@ mp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had his debut in Sydney , that many die , I asked , did not know that it is at all an Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the US sent athletes to competition , there has never been a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ jumping and had a athletes who had managed to end up to the end of 2012 . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Can@@ adi@@ ans to share the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ her Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the tramp@@ oline jump has a certain out@@ flow char@@ me , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enlight@@ ened ear to fit for a cl@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule than those for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but just an enthusiastic enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the kar@@ to@@ on@@ ous tre@@ m@@ bling of his never ton@@ ing thri@@ lling - but also the Grazie of the athle@@ tic and diving , the two sports that it is largely united . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; is derived from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &apos; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
&quot; p@@ ending winner jump on a gigantic tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , real and sal@@ ads ) before they land on the feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympics , you will be rated according to execution , difficulty and &quot; air time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ long athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio against each other . &quot;
the most common Olympic V@@ ektor is straight .
&quot; medalli@@ sts must go in their quest for gold , faster , upward and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and back down and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they do not only hunt the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the Out@@ standing wall , but in the television transmission also another ca@@ vities : that of the world or the Olympi@@ ar ords . &quot;
&quot; the pur@@ pos@@ eful pursuit is admir@@ ably , admir@@ ably , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even sti@@ r an audience back to tears . &quot;
&quot; but it is also what I find myself when listening to these games as something aw@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this offers the tramp@@ oline a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ jum@@ per is above .
an upward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ un@@ ces from , apparently weight@@ el@@ os like an astr@@ on@@ aut , go up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no h@@ ectic attack on the destination , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition where the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification and final wo@@ unds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in stre@@ aming around 13.00 Eastern Time ; that of the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will beam the ends as part of a afternoon @-@ blo@@ c on both days from 2@@ pm .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who will probably be over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the awareness raising awareness can only be achieved through the man@@ o@@ ids and the obj@@ ti@@ fication of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal recently , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits his air to the air , new fan@@ atic . &quot;

violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia call for violent resistance from the government .
witnesses say that zig prot@@ esting during the cl@@ ashes with the police have been killed .
is Ethiopia just to break up ?
&quot; in the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
but in the last few months protests against the government the country and extended into ever more areas .
last week thousands of people rus@@ hed to roads and demanded fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was not un@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful to human rights organisations .
witnesses spoke to that police officers went on heart@@ beat prot@@ esters and killed .
&quot; in the circulation of well @-@ being videos about the protests , which presum@@ ably run from the last or beginning of this year , how safety men will hit young people with poles , while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Authority on Human Rights is now calling for an ongoing investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country and in future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expan@@ sion@@ founded in the considerable pace .
its infrastructure dramatically improved - there is a new p@@ end@@ ator in the capital of Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; roads are generally quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; although Ethiopia has been anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations continued to dism@@ iss the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country was limited , whereby anti @-@ presidents have been effective in silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or in prison , were killed or rolled into the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and these have no other options except to prot@@ esting , it breaks off , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lectur@@ er in central Ethiop@@ ian Islands . &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
&quot; there are numerous complaints , which cover everything from the ground @-@ use to the stran@@ gl@@ ehold imposed with regard to the power of the ruling coalition . &quot;
&quot; after a broad @-@ abi@@ ding election last year , the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions along the border to Eritre@@ a ; a fight for this two , controversial line called for hundreds of lives . &quot;
an@@ al@@ ysts are afraid that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden have been more or less forced in recent years to take advantage of turbul@@ ence and ar@@ ming themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of being faced with the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems to be harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with social media , as cheap smartphones were more and more frequent and the internet services have been improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government does not lock access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies to hide from where they are staying . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave them that they gathered themselves together .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons of prosp@@ eri@@ ed the am@@ har@@ as , who come predominantly in Ethiopia , in the politics and economics , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of which are many Muslims and live in flat @-@ areas . &quot;
but even this is changing .
&quot; we are here , under a umbrella to coordinate &quot; , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests occurred in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray which accounts around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in military services , in trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former vine @-@ leader , was until his death at a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as the tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think corners . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st say that he was especially sav@@ vy in it , early signs of dis@@ cont@@ ent@@ ment and to use special objects to handle opponents and make them in@@ harmful . &quot;
&quot; the current regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ians of new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively un@@ due reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region in northern India , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analy@@ st say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tig@@ ray controlled by the Tig@@ ray controlled safety services .
many fear that the outcome will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time , Ethiopia has experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of elections were apparently colon@@ ized by the government and were subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following raid war@@ ps many prot@@ esters were killed , even though it was less than in recent months and this time of un@@ rest was relatively fast . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiop@@ ians leader for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , as well as new t@@ end@@ ings , as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month from attacked in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ian city , of Tig@@ ray guided shops and hat@@ red towards the Tig@@ ray in social media is becoming more and more common in social media . &quot;
analy@@ st say that the protests per@@ si@@ sts the US and other Western allies into a peculi@@ ar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for d@@ ron@@ eous flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though they have recently concluded that they have closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West wants to support the democracy clearly , he does not want his allies in an already vol@@ ati@@ fied area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin w@@ th@@ under migration . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his claim of Obama was founded IS@@ IS &apos; sar@@ cas@@ m .
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the last contro@@ versy at Friday that surrounds his campaign by accepting his repeated conception , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would not be the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; this clearly raised new questions about the communication skills of the presidential system , whether it is able to clear and communicate with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings up his collabor@@ ators who try to take him in protection during an event@@ ful phase of protection , to explain in the peculi@@ ar position to explain any statements which he could not meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the assignment in an election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp has created with regards to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really didn &apos;t want to indicate the president and Mrs. Clinton would have created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp , he is simply sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , where Mr Tru@@ mp said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation absolutely seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator H@@ ugh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp , Mr. Tru@@ mp would help to weak@@ en the statement that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it , he wanted nothing to know of the Republi@@ can presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of the cri@@ mp be@@ aks to Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign for dec@@ aying un@@ question@@ able levels of economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this subject again .
&quot; by using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Cl@@ int@@ on proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought to his defence by Sar@@ kas@@ mus .
&quot; at the end of July he had strong criticism on himself , when he said , the Russians were supposed to cho@@ p Mrs. Cl@@ int@@ ons E@@ emails , but later &quot; &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to move the lingu@@ istic borders in the policy and then re@@ rowing back to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans like they arrive , and then if necessary &quot; make clear &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication exper@@ tin which observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe it is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ use the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has taken an even greater note , because its survey values have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , published on Friday , showed a tour with a big jump in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally temp@@ ted to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for its pro@@ voc@@ ative utter@@ ance , he frequently accused his critics , dism@@ issed his statements or to understand his humor . &quot;
&quot; but as he has reinforced the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal fellow @-@ meeting to the uncomfortable situation to stand independently of how pro@@ voc@@ ative might be his statements . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s most prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , gave itself a great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , so Mr. Giuli@@ ani said to the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s statements , Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had created the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back @-@ h@@ ers , was completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most Mainstre@@ am @-@ Republi@@ can try to argue that the government under Obama , served in Mrs. Clinton as an external Minister , it was allowed to spread , spreading the situation in the Middle East aggressi@@ vely under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and bo@@ wed them to ride his words upon each of his words . &quot;
&quot; he gro@@ an@@ ed the &quot; poor , numbered &quot; television professionals , who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can not do it ! . &quot;
some of the Democrats talked about Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s ap@@ ology as only a further proof that he would be un@@ suitable for the presidential guard .
&quot; once placed over the price of the market , cafÃ© in Green@@ point comes back to Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; verb Cafe was a compens@@ ated cafÃ© in Williamsburg , in which you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years in good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from the Bedford Avenue Book Fair has been eliminated . &quot;
&quot; the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , which was launched in the summer of 2014 , sold Sei@@ fe in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes . &quot;
local people scre@@ ened it as the last loss in a gene@@ alog@@ ical city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is changing , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and verb now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but when New York change is , then it is also new finding . &quot;
&quot; a recur@@ rent bur@@ b cafe opened in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new lat@@ ch has Wi @-@ Fi and accept credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a very simple atmosphere . &quot;
coffee is also always good .
&quot; the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing member of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafÃ© . &quot;
he began to work in 2001 at Ver@@ b and remained there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered him to provide money for a new out@@ post , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained many things . &quot;
&quot; verb uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els , the same es@@ pres@@ so model . &quot;
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he also wanted to experiment .
he led new ingredients .
in the menu are sand@@ wich@@ es with bac@@ on and che@@ eses and there are Gar@@ ni@@ es such as captain and sau@@ cep@@ ons of oni@@ ons .
there is natural en@@ code .
&quot; the cafÃ© is no beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months Rodri@@ guez , Rodri@@ guez , that he had noticed a sl@@ ed current of old customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also eliminated by prices of Williamsburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was a such customer .
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after having moved to Green@@ point , it would take the way . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she gave a little while the coffee works , she said . &quot;
&quot; I realized that it was on the coffee and culture in the verb , who liked it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee again , even if they ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea to this day , which is another new supplement . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal since the beginning of the year in 2003 another long @-@ time and loyal customer .
he went there before work and do inev@@ itably always do the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss tor@@ ches and they prepare my Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said he has no Gro@@ w about it that the soap @-@ business has taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered a special soap for verb with the cold @-@ bo@@ ast coffee of the cafÃ© as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go into her offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the cafÃ© . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into the Polish and Rodri@@ guez , he told them to release them soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome . &quot;
the location has also further advantages .
a local S@@ aft@@ sman wants to fill the cold @-@ flo@@ cks of coffee into bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the cafÃ© is expanding to a nearby building .
for many customers a new verb goes out to get their old favor@@ ites .
&quot; Joseph W@@ itt was tri@@ bal , and said that he was destroyed in the ground , when the cafÃ© closed . &quot;
&quot; when the new cafÃ© opened , Wh@@ ile said that the Bet@@ ting of Lok@@ as and the bests@@ eller got a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to cra@@ wl , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in an enrich@@ ment meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the president , Franklin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , took lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a gour@@ mets , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a pen@@ ch@@ ant for refined delicacies on Fifth Avenue such as P@@ Ã¢@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland Aqu@@ atic soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on this day was slightly modest : filled eggs in Tom@@ at@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , potato mas@@ hed and as dessert a pl@@ ast@@ au@@ d@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people , &quot; says Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to Americans as they eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both the food histori@@ an .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was told by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told her book &quot; &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food @-@ perspective . &quot;
&quot; your newest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which is published on Tuesday in the Har@@ per Verlag , illustr@@ ates the history of American food during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , when they met with a re@@ por@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , straightforward Im@@ bis@@ s in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh k@@ es@@ and@@ wich with olive oil , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with mas@@ hed and vegetable . &quot;
&quot; when the Repor@@ ter Hack@@ br@@ ate ordered , this was a couple of discussion about food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
it was petro@@ leum @-@ bro@@ t , liver dum@@ b and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ bro@@ t . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and somewhat bil@@ ity@@ which the ingredient is stretched .
imagine so many continents that they serve them as dinner .
co@@ ins sm@@ ir@@ ks .
&quot; it has to be placed in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women co@@ habit@@ ants for male field offices and it was fresh@@ ly baked Past@@ els for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; they were the Americans who returned to hungry Europeans during the first World War . &quot; A Square &quot; &quot; draws the ways to which the country went out , not to be the s@@ laughter of the land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , tense Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; just as tense was the new bud@@ get@@ away : mysterious food such as Br@@ ote and Kas@@ ser@@ ollen were regarded as stap@@ le food , the bar@@ ric@@ ades as a &quot; wonderful way , eating resources , as coo@@ ks un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients to hide under a creative sauce . &quot;
fresh vegetables was replaced by cheap dry dr@@ ones .
&quot; meat , which was the centre of the American food for years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculi@@ ar compounds have been tried , since a cal@@ orie and critical satisfaction has priority to taste or even healthy cooking . &quot;
&quot; while her research for the book , which includes also recipes , he prepared a court from this epoch , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ anu@@ t butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular supplement on lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man continue from : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ anu@@ t butter and baked oni@@ ons do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the house recipes .
&quot; as never before or since then , fiscal res@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , Chief of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics , between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country such . &quot;
&quot; in recent articles published by recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become house@@ ke@@ epers , and to transform the challenge , Pamp@@ er such as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ r@@ ots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A Square Holiday &quot; &quot; is a festival of historic treats . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the reports of the response from the government to the hungry citizen , like President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cakes @-@ food . &quot;
&quot; while he openly praised the simple Io@@ wa farmhouses in his kitchen , he spoke like the milli@@ on@@ ess physical man of the world , to which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost g@@ ild@@ ed dining room and carried a smo@@ king .
he was a wonderfully realistic .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ anor had asked him to stat@@ u@@ ate his stomach with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the tou@@ ching of a household with no interest in tastes by Mrs Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , that the White House brought the boring food in Washington but also one of the most boring food prepared in Washington . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , to deal with food , was rejected as soon as the land came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , stated Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; the pair were better understood when writing the book , the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans in law better understood - for example , how they could not throw food away . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of the wast@@ age of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man reminded himself , &quot; &quot; she made people really sick . &quot;
there was the wind explo@@ its .
&quot; after the plate were vac@@ ated at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they moved and co@@ e a dessert they had prepared at home : the pl@@ ough@@ ing , the President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt to noon . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a practi@@ tioner , a modest recipes to send a name . &quot;
&quot; there was no curved cream , only pl@@ ough@@ ing , some flour , sugar , water and c@@ inn@@ amon . &quot;
&quot; each di@@ pped somewhat rel@@ uc@@ t@@ antly a spo@@ on in the teeth , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
surprisingly enough it was not bad .
co@@ e pick up three times a desc@@ endant .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ get@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; A few healed Wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
in bom@@ bs attack : he was the hero of Al@@ epp@@ o
he sat his own life at the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar .
he was the hero of Al@@ epp@@ o : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar dedicated his life to man in Syria .
he ris@@ ked all to save the lives of others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old itself died on a fac@@ bom@@ b attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; Om@@ ar was a member of the &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; , &quot; a civil defence group , which also saved the lives according to the image @-@ newspaper so far . &quot;
29@@ 00 Vol@@ unte@@ ers put their own lives in the game to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; Om@@ ar was the face of the group : a video of the civil war that shows him at a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a home , went to the world around the world . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans on the shining symbols in the gray of the war .
&quot; but as a hero , he has never seen himself , she said to picture : &quot; &quot; for me this is true Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die , save lives , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Om@@ ar was even an attack on the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helic@@ opter have shed four fac@@ bom@@ bs over the Alz@@ adia @-@ district , one was filled with Ch@@ l@@ org@@ as . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing difficulty . &quot;

GrÃ¶n@@ land : the oldest wh@@ tier is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
GrÃ¶n@@ land Black are usually only coming to the surface in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after a study on board the research @-@ ship S@@ anna .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with good a 1 km / h by the North Atlantic until today .
GrÃ¶n@@ land ha@@ ired after 150 years of young talent .
&quot; leis@@ ur@@ ely flo@@ wn out of Greenland at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean , in an hour it arrives at an average of just 1.@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it depends , the five meters long animal gets to s@@ atte 2,@@ 6 km / h - and it is half as fast as a ro@@ b . &quot;
this lon@@ ge@@ ance @-@ shaped lifestyle seems to be a silver bul@@ let for a high age .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the &quot; &quot; Science &quot; &quot; at any rate from a Greenland , which could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; said Alexander Sch@@ bis from the Max Plan@@ ck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this li@@ fes@@ pan , which means a world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; though , the evolution of evolution has long been that Greenland hair will be stone . &quot;
only faul@@ ts the evidence .
&quot; Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , eventually they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the thin@@ ly populated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive in the surface mostly only in winter . &quot;
about the lifestyle of Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie researchers do not know a little bit accordingly .
&quot; their Zeit@@ l@@ up@@ ent@@ emp@@ o Ma@@ Ãen them , as they were composed of six animals with a broad@@ cast@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; loo@@ t make this shar@@ ks anyway : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had the j@@ aw of a young polar bear . &quot;
possibly they chase them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the Eis@@ me@@ eres and look for Kad@@ aver that tor@@ ches out from higher water layers to bottom tor@@ ate .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 at Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a catch from the depth of North Atlantic . &quot;
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimeters long while the biggest 5@@ 02 centimeters measure .
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed it with the carbon @-@ 14 method of the original @-@ scale of the shar@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eyel@@ et occurs already before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
&quot; their birth should therefore lie in the early 19@@ 60s , as nuclear @-@ weapon attempts to sl@@ ate larger amounts of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in that with 220 centimeters length , the original animal contained its low excess of carbon 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated his 50@@ th birthday in 2012 with its study in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all the larger Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie had in their lens , with normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities , which emerg@@ es through cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timet@@ res long Greenland , an age of 335 years , while the k@@ ord @-@ shar@@ k with 5@@ 02 centimeters should even be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; Greenland @-@ females only then get off , when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers able to al@@ locate the length of an age . &quot;
&quot; because one of the animals was probably determined with 3@@ 92 centimeters on the threshold of the sexually mature and his age ended with 156 years ago , GrÃ¶n@@ land with the multip@@ lication are obviously at least one and a half years . &quot;
&quot; also , this is likely to be world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates . &quot;
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in e@@ isi@@ tive waters is not acci@@ dental .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 211 year old GrÃ¶n@@ land , in whose sp@@ eck at the neck a 120 years old resin @-@ tip that was captured before Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , it is often running to the organism of the animals living there . &quot;
so they mature - and age slower .
&quot; in order to warm water in the cold water , the animals are also often very large . &quot;
&quot; for the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal leaves heat . &quot;
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than in one gram .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as early as possible as many des@@ cen@@ dents , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , a very large animal should invest in its resources rather in a long life . &quot;
construction in double @-@ pack
&quot; with topics around the building , the municipal council has focused hard on the recent meeting . &quot;
&quot; with relief the board took the communication by Mayor Robert P@@ utz , to finally start the marketing of the younger co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; after the property issue , par@@ zel@@ li@@ tigation and Ex@@ clusi@@ ons have been clari@@ fied , the sale of plots in the housing areas &quot; Road l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; SchÃ¶n@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section 1 ) to prosp@@ ective buyers any longer in ways . &quot;
the council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential area of SchÃ¶n@@ au is young families and senior seniors alike .
&quot; as it was meant , participants can register now from now on the Town Hall , over the award of the plots will be advised of the council at its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to also request requests for rel@@ ocation of other commercial firms , associated with the creation of jobs , decided to be decided , decided to change the council &apos;s stay in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the field of sub@@ mer@@ its that is already being extended there by two plots in direction of state road . &quot;

&quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ xit @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lÃ¤nder , head of the competence of competence markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether money buildings continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , it is far from regulatory approval in the UK . &quot;
this is just big US banks .
several banks have already announced jobs to shift .
the Lob@@ by@@ Association Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; remains unchanged with 10000 new jobs at the Main Event ( s ) in five years .
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , is the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) united the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro zone , as well as further important authorities like the European insurance view of IS@@ IL and the ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lÃ¤nder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg reserves the very big fund business , cutting , as well as in Dublin in the infrastructure . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
furthermore points the city with slightly available commercial properties .
&quot; in Paris it is not as easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lÃ¤nder . &quot;
&quot; in the Seine , the Mi@@ ets for first @-@ class commercial properties are around 50 percent higher than in the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as fewer crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the corporate consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city stands on position seven , Luxembourg in No. 19 , Dublin , place in place 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7. place . &quot;
&quot; although the quality of life is a question of preference , &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot; &quot; ref@@ uses the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; but in spite of Bre@@ xit @-@ v@@ ot@@ um , the most important financial center in Europe will remain , my economic researcher . &quot;
&quot; this also speak the power relations : in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba ate at the end of 2015 approximately 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking sector , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives right @-@ cost from the Hepatitis C Pat@@ ent@@ stre@@ it with Mer@@ ck
a US @-@ office decided that Gilead Sciences Inc. was entitled to the re@@ imb@@ urs@@ ement of the legal costs which you formed from the Hep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June , Gilead is set free from a damages in the amount of $ 200 million for the injury of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were related to the block@@ bu@@ ster @-@ medications called S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Harv@@ oni of Gilead , following a US judge a pattern of mis@@ behavior from Mer@@ cks , including the opinion and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; in the survey of the law@@ suit on Thursday , US @-@ president of Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to let the costs have emerged during the defence of the case . &quot;
Mer@@ ck tries to cor@@ relate to Gilead that dominated the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines which can cure over 90 percent of patients suffering with liver illness .
&quot; the case goes back to the year 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck took each other def@@ endants and possession to laboratories , the Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir witnessed , the active ingredient in the medication of Gilead . &quot;

&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton announced their tax return for 2015 , these y@@ iel@@ ded a income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective Federal tax exemp@@ tion from 34,@@ 2 % on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Cl@@ int@@ ons USD 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton acquired almost USD 5,@@ 3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ aren ; the former Secretary of State gave a income of USD 3 million by the publisher Simon &amp; Sch@@ uster for her book about their term in the State Department . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ int@@ ons Candi@@ date for the Vice @-@ Presidents , Sen@@ ator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax declaration of the last ten years . &quot;
paid a effective Federal tax rate from 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to put standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Cl@@ int@@ ons Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri well known in an opinion . &quot;
in a cr@@ ass contrast Donald Tru@@ mp tu@@ cked behind false details and res@@ or@@ ators with regard to his former promises to publish its tax exemp@@ tions .
&quot; it is common for US presidential data to publish their taxes , although they are not obliged to do so . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New York busin@@ es@@ sman , and his lawyers have given as the reason for its ref@@ us@@ al of tax exemp@@ tion by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Cl@@ int@@ on &apos;s campaign for Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , in relation to the publication of the presidential elections of the Democratic Party . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s Special advis@@ ors , to CN@@ N , that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before tax spec@@ tions are not completed . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s critics , among other things also the Republi@@ can presidential elections of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already argu@@ ed that his ref@@ us@@ al questions regarding assets , his donations to charitable organisations , his business divisions , and various other associations , especially with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton had already over@@ thrown on the subject and published on Friday a video on the internet , where high @-@ level Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp are calling for his tax return . &quot;
on Thursday she spoke of the subject even during a speech about the economy of Michigan .
&quot; he refused to do what any other presidential elections has done in recent decades and to publish its tax exemp@@ tions , &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico has reported that Tru@@ mp has no or only paid no taxes during the 1990s , and a economic journalist of the New York Times c@@ ited a series of tax hav@@ n and tax advis@@ ors that might be the case . &quot;
federal control has become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a provision which is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial group con@@ glomer@@ ate to a meeting to exchange their taxes . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ets said , &quot; &quot; he had been subjected to a tax examination of the I@@ RS and Tru@@ mp &apos; fear &quot; &quot; fear of the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot;
Cl@@ ass@@ on campaign does not return tax return until 2007 .
&quot; the Cl@@ int@@ ons , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , has an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between the years 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.@@ 5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax statement of the Cl@@ int@@ ons of 2015 showed that these only USD 100 per income was related than wages , unlike the majority of all Americans . &quot;
&quot; its main investment situation was a cost @-@ effective index funds , from which Cl@@ int@@ ons divi@@ den@@ ds and income from USD 10@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;

&quot; the method has proved to be effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation , who had already taken advantage of the idea for years ago , together with the US nature conservation , bringing together volunteers in villages in the north of Tanz@@ ani@@ as , to viol@@ ate a non@@ violent quar@@ rel@@ ess to protect their houses and harvest without any animals . &quot;
previously many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves .
Friday is the &apos; phone ring that is dedicated to the animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change of their settings in these congreg@@ ations , with much more confident that they can hold the eleph@@ ants from their fields , vo@@ iced the manager of honey@@ guide Damian Bell in a notification . &quot;
the first two steps cover the illuminated of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles in one horn .
&quot; if he is not de@@ ported , a so @-@ called &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der avoided with earth is com@@ pressed together with a fire@@ works in a con@@ dom , whose end up to the bit@@ ch is turned down . &quot;
&quot; if it is lit , the con@@ dom comes with a bu@@ b and spr@@ inkl@@ ed fine dust at Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der in the air . &quot;

Jewish director sm@@ ashing Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after an &quot; Arab &quot; challenge - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media post@@ uring , after having betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre @-@ election since it had welcomed Arab guests according to an employee . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust @-@ documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; led his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by calling an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
during his last stay Lanz@@ mann to find Israel on the site list of the hotel .
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , is possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol provides a way to choose Israel on its own call center . &quot;
after an explanation the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; the answer that he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann written . &quot;
&quot; the hotel staff said that the measure is a &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reason that was behind it , extingu@@ ished in the fil@@ mm@@ aker even more che@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs , and they have demanded that the pres@@ election is er@@ ased from Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli amb@@ assador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov H@@ adas @-@ Cham@@ sman called this &quot; &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; reports the SÃ¼d@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled from this event .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this is to be worn in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even a even greater shame .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot;
the incident appear fairly large reson@@ ance on the internet where people called the whole sc@@ andal .
some under@@ laid the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that would have given the alleged accession of the Arab guests .
&quot; ash@@ amed you , &quot; it meant to be noted in another post , in which pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ fÃ¼r@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly referred all alleg@@ ations of itself and called the incident , &quot; &quot; seen &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; &quot; for Lanz@@ mann , reports the mirror . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel would not include into the quick@@ op@@ ort@@ list , &quot; quoted the SÃ¼d@@ deutsche Zeitung an rec@@ iter of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
it adds that the di@@ alling code was now added .

&quot; in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo , students gathered together in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo , when they were gathered together to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public education system . &quot;
the police put a tre@@ mor and rubber @-@ arm against the prot@@ esters .
&quot; the difficulties began , as a police officers bl@@ amed the students , which led to the police of rubber @-@ stories and ben@@ ches . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals by the Govern@@ ors of the Federal State Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the protest participants see Graf@@ fi@@ ti@@ ts against the provisional President of Michel Tem@@ er on walls spray .
the recent protests occurred a few days after demonstr@@ ators went into the streets to support the sus@@ pen@@ ed President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff that had been viewed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % to RT Business
&quot; by lifting the sanctions , according to the Russian amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade union between Moscow and Teheran in the year fell by 7@@ 0.9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in pages of Russian companies grew strongly in the country , told the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies take on existing connections with Iran , while new companies are prepared to get access to the market . &quot;
&quot; naturally , the further trade policy is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trade agreement between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 increase and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , the Russian imports in Iran have risen by 9@@ 1.5 percent and prayed $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the merch@@ ant turn was reached by deliveries of machines , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; said the Ambassador . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes for this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year , the Russian exports were about 35.@@ 000 Vis@@ as , primarily of Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , American citizens . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran has reached the top 20 countries in which the economy is concerned in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of bats in Russia last year , broken , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; personally I can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Sh@@ ir@@ az and Y@@ az@@ d who have received the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;

in the quiet recreational @-@ pac@@ ed hard@@ woods was the life @-@ joyful group during the first school holiday homes .
several full @-@ day trips stood on the program .
&quot; on one hand , it went to Bret@@ ten with the visit of the Str@@ el@@ z@@ oos . &quot;
&quot; on the other to Mau@@ l@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special nursery place in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third trip led to P@@ for@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; at the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the everyday life and food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; during the hot days the group ended at the Tie@@ fen@@ see in Mau@@ l@@ bron@@ n , which belongs to the br@@ ingen , swimming and planning . &quot;

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of Mer@@ cy
the minist@@ ries from the sea @-@ level E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the road on a four @-@ day pilgrimage in Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together they were suitable for four stages .
&quot; in order to bridge the time up to the next Rom@@ ani@@ on tour of all minist@@ ries in two years , the Upper @-@ State round of St. Anna is determined to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various Wall@@ paper targets have been tested and you decided finally for the Ep@@ is@@ cop@@ ate city of Freiburg where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the Mer@@ cy of Mer@@ cy on Frei@@ burger MÃ¼nster , a special pilgrimage destination . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from Bitt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Hei@@ ligen@@ als made their way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before the pastor Stor@@ ost came the pilgrims at a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ ms and shared the pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b , by train to the start of Vill@@ ingen , Germany was driving in the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where there was also a MÃ¼nster where the wife of Bel@@ ser@@ er loved and so the pilgrimage goes away from the MÃ¼nster . &quot;
&quot; each day tours were frames in the morning and in the evening , depending on a brief impulse with various packages , songs and writing . &quot;
but on the way the mines set on field cross @-@ crosses , chap@@ els or churches over and over again R@@ ast to sing a song from independent pilgri@@ m li@@ ed@@ he@@ ft . &quot;
for the nights stood at the local par@@ ishes at the disposal of the local parish .
&quot; at the Et@@ app@@ alled , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Heidi F@@ aller for a sav@@ our@@ y and stronger dinner and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day we went on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to GÃ¼@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; tags at this stage was the stage following St. Peter , which was the demanding track , however , at the heat , some 500 meters had to ti@@ ered at first some 500 altitude and will be heard . &quot;
the deser@@ ved reward was in the evening a common gri@@ lling on bath .
&quot; after the dawn , on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impos@@ ing monastery of St. Peter , we went to the closing stage in Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; obviously , and happily met the Min@@ is in the later afternoon at the Frei@@ burger MÃ¼nster , and through passed the gate of mercy . &quot;
with a little impulse given to God here .
&quot; at the Abend@@ messe in MÃ¼nster , the accommodation is announced on the pilgrimage of Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; after the service , the pilgrims could see the sac@@ rist@@ y and the altar of the altar . &quot;
the next day there was time for the Bre@@ is@@ gau@@ met@@ ropole .
afternoon we went back by train to Hor@@ b .
in the end all the participants agree that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience was shaped .
Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hes at home as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the choir team Spr@@ int in Rio de fame , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow , took the anchor role , who had made his governor Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the young man made the legend proud , when he thre@@ w home a victory of the favor@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , England stressed me a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympi@@ ad medals . &quot;
she repeat@@ ed@@ ed the trick after they took in March at the railways in London despite the review of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the rider Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a Hin@@ des .
Ho@@ ys retired be@@ got a gap where K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton were trying to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man who stayed them when they saw potential in the vill@@ i that now folds .
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - which won four years ago with Ho@@ y - and Sk@@ inner continued in the qualifying rounds of an Olympic ch@@ ord , but in the Stand@@ ar@@ dr@@ as won the New Zealand tr@@ aded in the first lap . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ des was scar@@ ed shortly after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team at the front and Sk@@ inner thought . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a great deal of transformation , when exec@@ uting in a higher gear to dec@@ eler@@ ate it and allow it Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked at his position as the BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when it came on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
&quot; I am here , to do my best and make me a name . &quot;
in the En@@ dr@@ unde we have placed an Olympi@@ ad set and the world champion was defeated .
it was just amazing .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 on the page Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des was too that he fell down on the train after a weak start . &quot;
he returned this statement later and there was no claim of England Ri@@ val .
&quot; in such an outstanding victory , there was no such problem for this time . &quot;
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; it feels with all the GB fl@@ ags on the Tri@@ bun@@ es like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team for the last three months .
&quot; we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we anticip@@ ate successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y it is in the area of the Pos@@ sible that he is repeated &apos;s victory of three oly@@ mp@@ ic gold medals in a contest . &quot;
&quot; this would be born for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on 23 March ( apparently , Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
the cheese of the ho@@ y is the same .
&quot; Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int , which today starts and will go over three days . &quot;
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the Team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels lonely to win alone .
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; if he wins two other gold medals , he should be be@@ aten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medalli@@ sts of the day , but there were more good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Br@@ adly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified for the fastest performance in the four @-@ four spot races . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.7 at the finish .
&quot; the world record , which won in London gold , was at 3 : 5@@ 0,@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition , at the Wig@@ gins with certainty . &quot;
he had suffered from the qualification yesterday in front of the qualification as well as wor@@ ship@@ ing him to measure his body size .
&quot; in the appropriate Women &apos;s Contest , who continues tomorrow and ended , av@@ anced Laura , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ pelago in Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord@@ era in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team rel@@ ies on his strong train team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a sn@@ ake of medals .
after a truly extraordinary demonstration of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio have been shut down .
&quot; it &apos;s just playing drama in the background , so the res@@ ign@@ ation of the Technical Leit@@ ner Sh@@ ut@@ ton in April in the middle of sex@@ ism and har@@ bours as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite afterwards , as could the legendary reputation of GB@@ s who reached the perfect moment he has reached its peak . &quot;

&quot; the future of the aluminum mel@@ ting from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand in the game , since the plant operator will announce the energy supply contract and hence the supply contracts will rise , as the deli@@ ver@@ sible energy company will be rus@@ hed . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant . &quot;
a career progression for 20 years is going through November .
&quot; up to 2000 jobs in the area of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land , are at stake . &quot;
no less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - could be at a closure .
&quot; in addition , there could come to domin@@ oes more than the mel@@ ting around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry Sch@@ mel@@ zer@@ ei , which led last year to closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station . &quot;
the mel@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and ris@@ ky a closing .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulations on the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian Dollars and last due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminum mel@@ tie with his Lo@@ y Yang A power station in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared with it that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the complex is in the multi @-@ hand property of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , where the Chinese company CIT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant is still operated in Port@@ land , which means more physical demand for electricity through the mel@@ ting , &quot; shared the company . &quot;
AG@@ L continued to be out that the contracts are so @-@ called &quot; securing transactions &quot; that will have come into force from November 2016 onwards .
&quot; contracts entered a 12 @-@ month period of notice , so that they will end 2017 . &quot;
&quot; thus , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential impact on the AG@@ L from G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong termin@@ ology markets for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L shared with that the value of the contracts were already written in the amount of $ 187 million in the &quot; expectation of an cancellation . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the Tre@@ aties , the &quot; &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... &quot; &quot; to operate the mel@@ ting or provide the power supply to the mel@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said it was concluded in 2010 a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which was to enter into force in 2010 , even though it is still a statement of guilty of why it is res@@ igned by the contract . &quot;
an@@ al@@ ysts warn of the poor economic circumstances of the industry in front of the possible closure of the Port@@ land Sch@@ mel@@ zer@@ ei in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of an@@ al@@ ysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land consume around 600 Mega@@ watt and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity . &quot;
&quot; should both lines disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as an electricity producer this would not be good , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Car@@ th@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is at the cover of the September September of the Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ omin@@ ator , 20 , Model and fourth subsidiary of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ th@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ omin@@ ator Kr@@ is is in the cover of the schol@@ arly sep@@ t@@ ember of the U.S. Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand amb@@ assador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran at the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me to the sight of this code to tears , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the unvei@@ ling of the Co@@ vers followed a bar@@ ge ( or just Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ th@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , ges@@ tre@@ t@@ etes Reality Se@@ ac@@ enter ( with the exception of the trouble @-@ popular Show@@ biz ) and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ p ) , as she ends the cover of her sister and ends with a classical turn : they all have planned a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the clever action of almost every birthday , a children &apos;s return ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &apos; you homeless that we have forgotten you ? &quot; , &quot; with the honest@@ y of a cartoon by 8 am ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her other girls somehow compete in this publicity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September September of the Vo@@ gue , the Vo@@ gue has certainly launched a new era of the Car@@ th@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ om great sister Kim likes , she likes , be@@ aten the Vo@@ gue Cover , be@@ aten ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September journal , is a League for itself . &quot;
the September issue is the most visited edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference , similar to a picture @-@ band as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the grove 615 pages advertising ) . &quot;
&quot; the unvei@@ ling of his cover stars is hop@@ eful that in the last two years , pictures of the German magazine is still p@@ oo@@ zing up before the official announ@@ cements . &quot;
&quot; women who were already in the cover were , include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years more &quot; celeb@@ rities , the modelling &quot; as &quot; Models , the celeb@@ rities are &quot; in the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar @-@ winner and Di@@ or @-@ Brand bot@@ schaf@@ ee Jennifer Lawrence was 2013 at the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even at the low chance that woman J@@ omin@@ ator is described - that is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of its generation - among the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ rities are not related to famous people or Reality stars or young people today who know how to make a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true on den@@ omin@@ ator ) .
they are truly talented women who are in the entertainment industry .
&quot; once , the last cover did appear , the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade had been one of the most successful years of her career . &quot;
&quot; of course , Jenn@@ ers definitely likes success not to anyone . &quot;
with her Reality TV story Jenn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world is always something tense .
in June he criti@@ ci@@ zed the lonely Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ omin@@ ator and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and calling them &quot; the Mist@@ ress@@ ments of the moment . &quot;
these feelings bo@@ iled back up again when the message telling Jenn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover came out .
but on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to go down at the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ omin@@ ator is in the cover of the September @-@ over@@ s of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
she works for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your Grun@@ er of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all of her sisters sell to you pictures of their own Pay@@ wall apps .
they s@@ ells from her painted pictures from Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine SE@@ X@@ Y .
and in their free time she is to see in the Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
common centers in 16@@ 0.000 people annually
&quot; more than 16@@ 0,000 of the aid of the country is projected annually by the community centres , while the sector is due to the impact of further mid@@ ations to already over@@ bur@@ dened transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland , already three of five people - mostly elderly persons , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ants and similar ones - in their request to free legal advice and legal advice . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already out@@ not@@ ated , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , these legal centers are expected to lose further 30 percent of their funding . &quot;
&quot; the director of the town centre of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said , that the last survey of the National association of community centres y@@ iel@@ ded that thousands of people will be rejected any year . &quot;
&quot; Far@@ rell said , the situation without a lifting of the federal government would only become worse . &quot;
&quot; que@@ fied community centres are chron@@ ically @-@ financed , which means thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , people with uns@@ man@@ age@@ able and thri@@ ving debt , families , who were released by divi@@ ding people , workers , which have an un@@ just manner and this gathering shows that they can not get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; from June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent , which means thousands of need@@ less people from Queensland to cope with their legal problems without any assistance . &quot;
&quot; we call on the General Assembly and the Federal Minister as well as the sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to get up these mid @-@ abbrevi@@ ations , so that people may need the help they need to get in legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the national government filled their commitment to raise funds for right @-@ to @-@ date on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to view the needs of the community centres and their customers , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government has invested in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp El@@ amed campaign after staff alleg@@ edly paid a weapon
&quot; new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign was indic@@ ted because of its in@@ action , after it has been told that their struggle @-@ manager for North Carolina was directed to an employee , while in February they were on a je@@ ep in February . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in a indic@@ t@@ ment which was submitted on Wednesday at the National Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software program@@ m@@ able for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; Bord@@ ini gave an obligation to have spent a month , that the issue would be governed internally before he realised that it would not happen . &quot;
&quot; the campaign , Earl Philip , &quot; moved a gun , placed his right for@@ ef@@ inger on the de@@ duction , and r@@ amm@@ ed the run in Vinc@@ ed Kni@@ eper , &quot; gave Bord@@ ini in his indic@@ t@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; after having described himself in local and regional campaign guidance , Bord@@ ini had already confirmed the same experience with Philli@@ p , he was in the indic@@ t@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired , in order to set damage , &quot; gave Bord@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; the indic@@ t@@ ment will only come two days after the Republi@@ can presidential elections , when he set up a crowd set in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - Sh@@ uss@@ w@@ affe owner and weapon @-@ dogs should take action if its Ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton should be elected and judge . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign was clear that the media would have torn away his words from the context , and that he would not hur@@ ry to violence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ is complaint requires damages from the campaign for the violation of the duty of duty and of Philip for bodily injury , and ab@@ ide of mental damage . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey prior to countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U are losing
&quot; among the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , there are considerable losses for the SPD and CD@@ U government . &quot;
&quot; this was representative of the opinion research institutes , IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black government bo@@ unds in the north could not be further ruling in the north , this is not possible after the survey in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to put the government on government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD conven@@ ed up of 35,@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party is therefore limited only shortly before the CD@@ U , which could be back on 23 percent again . &quot;
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D controversial .
&quot; the left would be 19 per cent ( previously 18,@@ 4 percent ) , and the Af@@ D would be represented with 19 percent for the first time in the country . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens despite slight losses with 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) returned to the Schwer@@ iner &apos;s tag .
&quot; N@@ PD and F@@ DP , each with 3 percent were not represented in the country . &quot;
&quot; in the Berlin deport@@ ation selection , the SPD of the survey was estimated that only 23 percent ( election in 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; thus , they were still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; with 14 per cent , the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 per cent for the first time . &quot;
&quot; by 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return to a return , the pirates would be opposed to it in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Zeit@@ l@@ upe : 20 years ago the Nokia communic@@ ator came onto the market .
&quot; the success@@ ors , domin@@ ate the world - its producer experienced a disaster . &quot;
the tool weigh@@ ed almost a half kil@@ ograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was rather top@@ or@@ ly . &quot;
the built @-@ in store was initially eight meg@@ aby@@ tes that would be sufficient for about two sel@@ dom with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 Gig@@ abyte .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; came just 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a couple of euros , lovers may still buy the devices in the Internet , but they come somehow from the St@@ one@@ age of the boarding . &quot;
&quot; however , 20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at the C@@ eb@@ it computer trade fair in Hannover as &quot; office in the West@@ ent@@ rop@@ en@@ heim . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone was able to receive a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
even access to websites was possible via HTML browser if even agon@@ izing .
a Pocket calcul@@ ator was available to a digital book repair and a electronic calendar .
&quot; there was a small ant@@ enna , and the mobile phone could work similar to a laptop . &quot;
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen found .
&quot; quite proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , thus about 1400 Euro . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphones in Germany was 2015 at 3@@ 92 Euros .
&quot; in August 1996 , no one was able to see that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era . &quot;
since then everything is different .
&quot; smart phones are a success story , although not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the cell @-@ card of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented dro@@ aster , was finally sold to Microsoft and handled . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s vendors , all of them later came as Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always and everywhere , this is today for very many people everyday . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; sold around 1,@@ 4 billion devices , Samsung and Apple at least 555 million units . &quot;
global sales of the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
&quot; to do this , the well @-@ running shops of the pay@@ er App providers and the tel@@ ecom industry come . &quot;
around the smartphone in the meantime we have created a whole industry .
&quot; the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple @-@ Chef Steve Jobs at the Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communications , easy to use via touch screen . &quot;
&quot; the winner of Apple began , still today the iPhone is the main product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who controlled the market . &quot;
&quot; finally , they disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
s@@ agen now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the Smartphone is 20 years after its invention is a matter of course .
in the inc@@ ision today each German today looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; we all have to learn to set the smartphone also away , &quot; said just Jan@@ ina ball , is responsible for the personnel in the Siemens @-@ Board of personnel . &quot;
permanent availability is now considered as a cur@@ se and blessing at the same time .
England must direct and extend the oly@@ mp@@ ic spirit
&quot; He@@ a@@ throw is not only possible in our local community and in London , but in the whole country of renewal and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; for me it was the greatest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as we did in London in 2012 , when we run a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from playing . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
&quot; and we will achieve this , by offering new opportunities for local companies and firms close to He@@ a@@ throw . &quot;
&quot; for our local communities we will continue to create some 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips , create new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport Neighbor@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of London in 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too big . &quot;
&quot; I was told that England will never be ready for the games , and that we will be blin@@ ded on the world stage . &quot;
the two @-@ fl@@ ers had w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; there are always obstacles to dis@@ appearance , but He@@ a@@ throw answers any given question to him . &quot;
just like the Olympic Games is He@@ a@@ throw for many and not for single an infrastructure .
&quot; enlargement is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , Â£ 211 billion to strong growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and in the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has been implemented a Â£ 11 billion for infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport can be built up to the T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequ@@ ented tracks of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are willing to supply a third track , which is supported by Â£ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
London &apos;s London games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
&quot; it is time that we direct this oly@@ mp@@ ic spirit and expand he@@ a@@ throw in order to safeguard our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs , to be proud of England . &quot;

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und mouse game &quot; &quot; regarding ad @-@ blocking &quot;
&quot; for companies who earn money selling money according to any of the software license attempts to handle ad block , a &quot; cat@@ - and mouse game . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display at its desktop page , the Ad@@ block Plus has a blog@@ post in which it communic@@ ates that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday he shared Facebook with that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ page would change the en@@ coding regarding its advertisements , in order to detect it , which is part of the page advertisements . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to handle the new codes .
&quot; in a blog@@ post , the spokes@@ man wrote by Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er battle is already underway since the invention of ad @-@ lock@@ ers , and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world @-@ largest company has left for social media in the struggle , is a strong indication of how worrying ad @-@ lock@@ ers for the industry have become . &quot;
&quot; according to a study last year , according to a study last year by Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people are scor@@ eboard . almost four times as much 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 750 billion daily users , who are able to access Facebook via their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ value 84 percent of the adver@@ ts took from advertising . &quot;
&quot; the company has it on display block on desktop PCs otherwise , since mobile ad blocking application has no effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared an speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs is making a sufficient large percentage of revenue , so that Facebook appears the investment of such a step as a worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared it that it would be &quot; ad @-@ prize pool &quot; to raise the people more control over them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook suggested that there would be new filters worrying because they would also block content on the page which are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users this does not represent a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , told a spokes@@ man of Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot;
&quot; ad new@@ blocks are a stupid tool , which is why we concentrated instead on development tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , in order to lay more control in the hands of the people . &quot;
women &apos;s alleged self @-@ genocide on Swiss highway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witness to witness a woman in the early hours of the morning on Thursday with an alleged su@@ ic@@ ide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman laid down in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of des@@ per@@ ation &quot; &quot; on the street and were taken by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a welding in the age of 49 years , consisting of several vehicles , including a trucks , was transferred to death . &quot;
it died still on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police said these as well as every witness of the incident . &quot;
&quot; it was opened a investigation procedure , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to the Le Trib@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
yet it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a cl@@ ash avoidable ?
&quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accountable .
in each of the two cases - when a person worked in the dark on the highway - was decided that the drivers do not assume that a pedestrian in the middle of the night runs on the highway as it was called the newspaper .
&quot; last year was acqu@@ itted a polic@@ eman of the casual killing , having received a man and killed , who was in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and went on the street unconscious , took the judgment . &quot;
&quot; the court proved that the polic@@ eman had responded to a not@@ ary -- in an justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ een situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges , should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA Klim@@ amo@@ del : Venus was once used
the Venus was probably extinct according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies from NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that are similar to those of clim@@ bers .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have exp@@ elled with its hot , waterproof surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once experienced . &quot;
scientists have previously predicted that the slow motion of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere and still slowly twi@@ sted . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably refers more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to face life and to rise up even more quickly . &quot;
early Venus prof@@ ited also from a sun which was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , exp@@ ose the slow motion of Venus its de@@ mar@@ gins of the sun almost two months long , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thickness of clouds , which affects the surface of a large portion of the sun heat . &quot;
&quot; the result are average @-@ temperatures , which are some degree cooler than that of the earth today are . &quot;
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resem@@ bles the evolution that was previously assumed by Plan@@ eten@@ ers .
although she was once be@@ di@@ ble probably was the Venus -- in the course of more heat and ultr@@ avi@@ olet light exposed .
your oceans con@@ dar@@ ed and their water v@@ ap@@ or was burned down from the ultr@@ avi@@ olet light .
&quot; as its hydro@@ xy , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide still remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy comes back as a trainer of description Aval@@ ai@@ che
&quot; Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and vice president Of Ho@@ ck@@ ey Operations for the Colorado description and led to a lower co @-@ determination principle in the decision @-@ making process of the team . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ama Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and strengthened that the association will immediately be looking for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; in the last three years I have been my duties as Chief trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ck@@ ey Operations for the Colorado of Avalon , with energy , passion and identification , &quot; vo@@ iced the 50 @-@ year of Roy in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; in the course of summer , I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , this requires and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and vice president Of Ho@@ ck@@ ey Operations must be perfectly adapted to the organisation . &quot;
he also has to have a co @-@ determination principle in decisions which affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are not currently being fulfilled .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , Roy , Roy , on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked him with him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me about this decision today , &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .

Ke@@ pler measures rotation rate of stars in the stars of Pl@@ ei@@ ades
&quot; the latest Mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ dre@@ tel@@ esc@@ ope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation , among the stars of the star cluster of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the star cluster could be found at different formats , as well as in which context the rotation periods have to be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; we hope that we experienced by the compar@@ ing our results with other stars , learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his old age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star@@ chy of the Ple@@ j@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 Light@@ years from the earth .
many stars in this star cluster created some 125 million years ago now can reach the adult .
you are now turning at the fastest .
for peak rates this str@@ aps are large amounts of star@@ ches .
&quot; since these win@@ ch travel through the mag@@ net@@ fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is aged , its rotation begins to dec@@ eler@@ ate . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation of a every star by taking the time between the awakening of an recognizing star@@ ch@@ equ@@ es -- such as sun@@ di@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of Rot@@ ations@@ rates shows that more massive star slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dances , with a bigger star slower pi@@ rou@@ ters to be smaller than smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ ades , we see that slow Rot@@ ors tend to be massive , while faster ri@@ ores , to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; she said part@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the stars of the Ple@@ j@@ aden so close is , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities as rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar Rot@@ ation in both directions , younger and older &quot; , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still a lot ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how , when , when , and why stars would slow down its rotation , and speak their &quot; dance shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reports detailed reports on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades , who will soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ Star occurs
the tears help by Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the U.S. Bas@@ eball @-@ Star in the best days from base to base .
&quot; after his emoti@@ ve withdrawal of the announcement , the 41 year old professional will take place on August 12 against the Tampa Bay R@@ ays , last time the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I love this game , and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; to the &apos; , explained the 14 @-@ out all @-@ star game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ guez became the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series . &quot;
his signature under a second @-@ year deal has been around 27 million US dollars every year since 2007 .
&quot; by the end of the contrast on 31 December 2017 , he worked in full content as a consultant and youth coach - in full salary . &quot;
as a player there are Rodri@@ guez for a long time with performance .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; &quot; R@@ us &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mil@@ estones . &quot;
with the Hall of Fame @-@ Fame H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays assign only two further bas@@ eball @-@ players in the most important statistics similar values .
&quot; however , in the silence of the bas@@ eb@@ alls the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is likely to be absorbed . &quot;
&quot; because so successful Rodri@@ guez - Nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - in the field was , so controversial is its appearance outside the place . &quot;
&quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star was made at &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; , &quot; taken between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was locked up for 211 games due to an acquisition in the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; thesis @-@ sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; until the end of 2014 for 211 games . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez is regarded as main suspic@@ ious to have for years been obtained via an anti @-@ aging clinic in SÃ¼d @-@ Florida .
after a dispute the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; the League could even have done for a favor of 2014 for the year 2014 , for I have played 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez then col@@ ff@@ is@@ ant . &quot;
also his f@@ arewell days do not go un@@ even .
while many bas@@ eball legends have once again got the big stage once again Rodri@@ guez had often been sitting on the bank .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; my job involves the attempt to win any game , &quot; says Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married with the actress Cameron , and the relationships with Pop@@ star Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson lon@@ ged , sympathy of fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee Arch@@ ri@@ v@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; the supporters of the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez Team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first D@@ op@@ ener &quot;
caught : because of a positive ling@@ erie may not start weight@@ lif@@ ters Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ es .
a caught ath@@ l@@ ete would have won almost one medal .
&quot; in front of the seventh race , the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro has become known . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer@@ er in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and Polish weighing Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of any critical weight@@ ed athle@@ tics competitions this news at the time . &quot;
&quot; at Ch@@ en has been proven the di@@ ure@@ tic @-@ hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de , used last Sunday to be used as a mas@@ king means for di@@ op@@ ting instances . &quot;
the International Sport@@ Tribunal CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon local time its exclusion from the Olympic Games .
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , only around 0.@@ 09 seconds I missed the bronze medals . &quot;
on Friday Ch@@ en would have to participate in the run@@ ners over 50 m of the Fre@@ is@@ le .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ sample at the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) .
&quot; the National Association assumes the matter &quot; very serious and demanded by Ch@@ en full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a communication : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Tribunal and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , no longer the I@@ OC , but the CAS for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases is responsible . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio the news was se@@ ated by the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ owa by , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old , thus went into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this is an incredible shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is inno@@ cent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; stated the athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said to act on the bot@@ h@@ ed substance to act as an EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ owa was provisional provisional , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should be positively dropped . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ iko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w immediately turned into words with criticism of the ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been ruled out . &quot;
&quot; thus , approximately all weights from the chron@@ ically @-@ wearing @-@ loaded nation could not be part in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday also the case &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; , &quot; the London @-@ Olympi@@ asi@@ eger in the class up to 85 kg was tested for three days previously positively to the an@@ cho@@ ols Ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both disp@@ atch , both should not start in class up to 94 kg . &quot;
before the start of Ath@@ ath@@ l@@ ete is especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa a further serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
&quot; the World Bank IA@@ AF , the whole Russian team led up to an exception due to systematic dam@@ s to the start , even the run@@ way of Kenya manufactures numerous poor news in Rio . &quot;
in the swimming pool the former persecution in China had taken care of between athletes .
thus the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t took up the Chinese Olympi@@ ans Sun Yang hard .
&quot; Sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of Fre@@ is@@ le , I want to commit myself , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio . &quot;
sun also stood at the heart of a confrontation with the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; said this . &quot;
sun was positive in 2014 with the Chinese champi@@ on@@ ships positive to the stimulation of the Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had only a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
Dat@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ pres@@ sen h@@ ackers h@@ ran@@ som
programmers of ext@@ or@@ tion @-@ Mal@@ ware are currently targeted companies - and are successful .
&quot; according to a current survey of the mal@@ ware @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ ey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once again victims of a attack with black@@ mailing software . &quot;
almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming at a ran@@ som@@ ware em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement .
40 percent of the victims will@@ ingly pun@@ ched by the perpet@@ rators brought by the perpet@@ rators necessary to use the systems and data being able to use .
the perpet@@ rators Speci@@ alize their Er@@ pres@@ ser software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attack on corporate networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to pres@@ end ran@@ som is considerably higher than with private use . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the damage software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ag@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to be advertis@@ ed .
then the perpet@@ rators brought up@@ tion software to itself .
&quot; only privately @-@ took the goal , but the change to company attacks occurred in the past months sc@@ ary quickly . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works for a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it is specifically looking for incomplete files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as for archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
then the software presents the demands of the pres@@ presses .
&quot; to get the files to the files , the victims need money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where with private use , the personal photo database is at stake , it goes with companies for sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production still stands . &quot;
consequently higher is the damage when a ran@@ som@@ ware l@@ icks .
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German companies affected by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to dis@@ rupt the business operations , in a case people were living in living . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several times in Germany were victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of sick@@ le . &quot;
&quot; we say the victims still : pays off , you therefore contributes to the problem , &quot; explains Kl@@ ag@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their dates back . &quot;
&quot; for managers it is difficult , given the demand of perpet@@ rators in operation to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
the h@@ acker in turn know that and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the security researchers obtained from F @-@ Secure the user surfaces and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to establish a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they declare their victims by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , freely accessible support websites or de@@ code any example files . &quot;
&quot; and become a private busin@@ es@@ spe@@ ople , after payments of a few hundred Euros , companies need to get some hard on and pay five @-@ dig@@ it sums in order to reg@@ ain their data from un@@ coded . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively risk @-@ free gains from the Ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ black@@ mailing , the h@@ acker is becoming more professional and share the work , explains safety exper@@ tly Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from Anti@@ virus @-@ provider Sophos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within one week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is however that it is about three or four people . &quot;
the programmers sell their poll@@ ut@@ ants then into the form of a software design .
&quot; the recent Mal@@ ware kits created by the mal@@ ware , advis@@ ing and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; included in delivery is a adapt@@ ability tool , so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and brand@@ ing can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the pres@@ pres@@ s are then looking for further h@@ ackers to spread the newly bought software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
&quot; thus , you log@@ ged in one of the forums at the bottom , buy the set from a crime and commissioned an other way to install the software on as many PCs . &quot;
the payment is made per non @-@ authentic@@ ated calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually conf@@ use the crimin@@ als then sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known in many companies that make their data better secure .
over 50 percent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey to be able to det@@ on@@ ate Ran@@ som@@ ware using file @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threat to successful investigation , the perpet@@ rators are instead associated with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ag@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; thus , the damage to the type of data is still much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpet@@ rators could be able to take completely new goals on the internet of things in the future . &quot;
&quot; on the Hack@@ er@@ ode Def@@ con illustrated security researchers , how they could get used to control thermo@@ stat into their control with the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of winter , the Fre@@ etown of such a block victim could well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpet@@ rators then rather block the heating in the future a complete manufacturing road in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware might also be a subject in Industry 4.0 . &quot;

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday @-@ to @-@ day
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda will pack everything : a little SU@@ V , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; sound rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1,60 m high HR @-@ V works rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the front row and in the F@@ ond . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top is falling out there . &quot;
versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage room .
&quot; it is not only available for a trunk of 45@@ 3 l with high @-@ issued and 10@@ 26 l for converted back , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical , when it sounds : the sitting area of the back@@ seat can be high @-@ caps and offer storage space , which is high from the ground up to a height of 1,@@ 24 m . &quot;
&quot; the luggage boot is easy to charge , but the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ l fitted with 88 kW / 120 hp speeds up the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in large rotating ranges .
he might expect his work qui@@ eter somewhat more qui@@ eter .

a cycle drive is not offered .
&quot; the cock@@ tail is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;

two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI socket are under arm@@ rest and therefore are somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some .
the approximately 29@@ 000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel are fine .

disease cases : when pays the organizer
&quot; because of their trip , holi@@ day@@ makers get back money after their trip , if the cause of the disease is des@@ perate to find at the hotel . &quot;
&quot; but this is only the case , if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms . &quot;

de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨re is aimed at implementing the proposals by up to the elections in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another human rein@@ forcement of security forces , namely &quot; in medium @-@ sized order for more than several years . &quot;

the last much discussed discrimination for doctors should remain in accordance with de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨res words .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the doctors , he wants to search for solutions like the threat of the citizens could be reduced , he said with a view to psych@@ ic symptoms . &quot;

better transport flow at the Autobahn exit
it looks up regularly on the uph@@ e@@ al road - here is a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the legal tender is to be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all cars , who are driving in occupational traffic on the ambient roads each evening in the st@@ au , if they drive over the motorway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; the country &apos;s road construction is extended to the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer road and the departure Wes@@ der Strasse , the right @-@ off track by 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then walk directly from the hammer street on the right .
&quot; the great advantage : the traffic will share breakfast early , thus increasing the overall level of running on the multi @-@ car section of the Bundes@@ straÃe 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U fac@@ tion in the districts of the MÃ¼nster e @-@ West .
the road @-@ trail on the Zu@@ br@@ inger is annoying the car @-@ drivers especially between 17 and 19 hours .
week@@ days extends back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes beyond .
&quot; reason is the t@@ adel@@ ke on the B 51 just before the departure Wes@@ er StraÃe . &quot;
from here the traffic will only be hung over the Autobahn bridge .
the second track had to be re@@ constructed in the three @-@ three years .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had result , that the bridge no longer has the required sh@@ aking force in order to absor@@ b the heavy traffic loss . &quot;
&quot; how long will this Eng@@ pass and the connected st@@ etter will last , the responsible national office can not say . &quot;
&quot; however , it is expected to reck@@ on with years : because the bridge has an official launch period up to the year 2034 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal tender , the country is aware of the busi@@ est time in the school holidays , because with disabilities to be expected . &quot;
the traffic is handed over to the building on Tuesday and on Wednesday .

rain instead of star @-@ bu@@ ys : hope of weather @-@ better
&quot; the weather has made the star @-@ monkey Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany at the night for Friday a walk through the bill , but there is still hope . &quot;
&quot; the night was not suitable for clouds and rain , to observe the heavenly spectacle , the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we certainly see many star@@ ters at the sky . &quot;
&quot; with the star type , it is Per@@ sei@@ den , which belong with 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the fastest star @-@ doll@@ s . &quot;
they have their name because they apparently come from the constell@@ ation Per@@ se@@ us which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips on troubles
&quot; in the evening , you walk down forever , at night you walk twi@@ sting in the morning , in the morning , too far before the W@@ eck@@ er@@ ring will no longer think of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute about one quarter of adult sufferers and more than ten per cent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as un@@ relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be multiple causes underlying by Hans @-@ GÃ¼nter We@@ eÃ , executive member of the German Society for sleeping @-@ research and dormit@@ ory . &quot;
&quot; what you understand , but the in@@ som@@ nia , so is an inhal@@ ation and a sle@@ eving . &quot;
&quot; right now , many people feel as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , Vor@@ os@@ cill@@ ator in the German state @-@ association with practice in the Sax@@ on @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind bed@@ ste@@ al ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; behind this , organic , mental or waste @-@ related factors , but also drugs are stuck . &quot;
not rarely is the sle@@ ep@@ tive expression of another disease .
&quot; very early w@@ aking up is often associated with depression , &quot; says We@@ aving . &quot;
and it can be that various factors would like to each other .
&quot; who , for example , has a case of dis@@ agreement , can be poor@@ ly lying , w@@ acht every two to three hours and starts ur@@ gency to p@@ onder@@ ing about everyday problems and p@@ aving , there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
from when to go with sleeping disorders to the doctor ?
&quot; whoever does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and the day is affected , should go to the doctor , betra@@ yed We@@ aving . &quot;
&quot; the impair@@ ment may look very different : one is de@@ pressed , tired , un@@ aus@@ ed , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has a m@@ oods or bodily ache as stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to all@@ evi@@ ate the sle@@ ep@@ tive , it is important to find out the causes . &quot;
&quot; as treatment options are used among other things such as therapy , a cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also drugs - classical body @-@ coated tablet only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ question . &quot;
&quot; precip@@ itation sle@@ eves are hardly supported in Germany , empha@@ sizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary , medical center of the Char@@ itÃ© Univers@@ itÃ¤t@@ smedi@@ zin Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one should first consult with sleep problems initially to the primary care provider . &quot;
it can be clari@@ fied with exam@@ inations whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who was supposed to go to sleep , and what happens there ? &quot;
&quot; for exam@@ ining in the sleeping laboratory equipment , for example , in snor@@ ing with respir@@ atory diseases , in case @-@ taking care of sleep , or if one does not find the cause of a sin@@ ess , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
you really need to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a mid@@ day , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after leaving , one goes to his normal time in bed . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the electro@@ des at the body there is a nas@@ al g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a spra@@ yer at the finger . &quot;
&quot; moreover , a camera shows the ceiling to sleep . &quot;
how can sufferers have the problems put on the handle ?
there are quite a lot of vac@@ ill@@ ers where you can set for a better sleep .
&quot; winery counts to : regular sleeping and ste@@ ward times , not to sleep long in bed , don &apos;t watching TV , don &apos;t watching TV to sleep , alcohol , and at night not to watch at the clock - then you start immediately and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to be
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus D@@ ei@@ bler took advantage of the D@@ SV @-@ team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he had picked gold at the first World Cup for the first time in Doha and presented his first world record . &quot;
now the former D@@ SV @-@ ath@@ l@@ ete Markus D@@ ei@@ bler provided by Facebook in front of his former ex @-@ team mates .
&quot; in a country where an Olympi@@ asi@@ eger got 20,000 â¬ rewards and a jun@@ k of 15@@ 0.000 â¬ should nobody be surprised about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on the night on Friday on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in water sports is bad , but the op@@ ing@@ controls , however very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote very much and do not even look at the issue of dop@@ ing not as closely as they do . &quot;
&quot; I do not say that here the controls should be shut down , &quot; he stated . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is how you should keep it with countries too .
&quot; those who cannot be controlled a certain time before the World Cup / OS of independent insp@@ ectors of W@@ ada / F@@ ina , may not take part , &quot; asks the choice of Hamburg , who now operates a ice cream . &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de by Car@@ rier arrest
professional Di@@ eves at the DÃ¼sseldorf Airport
&quot; civil law of the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf police achieved the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years . &quot;
the Tat@@ ry had committed several pick@@ ups and pan@@ nier bags .
&quot; on 21 : 30 p.m. civil officials visited a Ban@@ de airport in DÃ¼sseldorf , a bank that was known to the police officers in the past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July this year and were a collaborative , job @-@ growing and particularly professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the crime com@@ miss@@ ary 34 can refer to the th@@ iev@@ es , which were mostly written to Germany to decline of criminal off@@ ences to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they had explo@@ ded a total of about 15,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a couple of lime trees , meanwhile some len@@ tic@@ ul@@ ls : the Rig@@ a@@ er StraÃe in Berlin @-@ fried@@ rich@@ sha@@ h appears at first glance not so , but the police count it to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; one goes along the road from the east to the west , one gets to the places , a fres@@ her kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
at the fa@@ Ã§@@ ade of a gray house someone has ugly ! &quot; bo@@ oming .
&quot; opposite a Li@@ dl , which is also to be demol@@ ished , it is already built : until 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; as the official property company called &quot; &quot; Cem@@ et@@ sha@@ ved &quot; &quot; in the last few weeks , however , pre@@ fers with comb@@ usti@@ ble cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , now the residents had rented contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , H@@ enk@@ el had expressed several times for a hard drive in police against the project , the region as &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomy . &quot;
&quot; after 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ for@@ ge were vac@@ ated with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolled with 300 police officers , according to 30 to 40 officials and three team wag@@ ons on the ground , picked up the street with the number 94 . &quot;
meanwhile renovated construction workers in order of the un@@ familiar land@@ owners the spaces .
&quot; on 13 July the Berlin Court of Directors was decided that the clearance was illegal , and one day later the police and buil@@ ders under the rejo@@ icing of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the street peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain yourself . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house @-@ projects there are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; lef@@ tist violence is not the main bul@@ ge of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jana * , which are three children here , mainly of the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house @-@ projects , they share the concern of rising sales and c@@ entering . &quot;
it does not sound like a pine that can bring about the majority of polic@@ eman before v@@ and@@ ali@@ ating left .
&quot; the pro@@ dig@@ al , who make the Berlin interior and the police between home occup@@ ants and their neighbors , does not exist as obviously . &quot;
&quot; peaceful sha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; quarter , which today still has a lower A@@ verage , and a high poverty of poverty . &quot;
&quot; occup@@ ations and the consequ@@ ent living projects have long been owned by the Kie@@ z : 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including virtually all the Main@@ zer street very close to the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been vac@@ ated by large police programs in a down@@ right street scene , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the rig@@ a@@ er and were still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district of the city has become increasingly becoming a mag@@ net for tourists and electoral liner from around the world : with them , people from GDR and former house@@ wives are now living their pine trees . &quot;
&quot; this has also been remarkable in the rent , which has increased by nearly 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
&quot; many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development , one sees them on counter@@ f@@ ted sli@@ ces or fresh@@ ly coated fac@@ ades , which have been turned with pig@@ gy ni@@ sts . &quot;
there was no other street this year was mentioned as often together with the words &quot; lin@@ ks@@ aut@@ on@@ ome authority . &quot;
&quot; one reason that not all neighbours can see that as a problem , could be affected by the crime ; crimes such as bodily injury are based almost exclusively against police officers . &quot;
&quot; the biggest part of the off@@ ences are made in the conditions of the crimes , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial of 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as far as violence did , she is conf@@ using : people in the 94 are their neighbours who were not sure . &quot;
also the famous burning cars put it directly in the Rig@@ a@@ er no longer .
&quot; for who studied architects , their street is not a crime burning , on the contrary , &quot; &quot; here one helps each other , lives along the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliberately left the rig@@ a@@ er street - and stayed .
&quot; that &apos;s why it was also so important that the inhabitants have reg@@ ained their road : from police , politics and the media , which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of female artists such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to take them away : through the re@@ bound@@ less new buildings in former buildings , that hur@@ ry the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are all con@@ domini@@ um apartments , which are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so well stun@@ ned , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely not appro@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; but what should we do , if one never h@@ ears someone ? &quot;
&quot; fru@@ stration , there is fru@@ stration on all pages of fru@@ stration , even in the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for the drawn up , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house @-@ projects and the left scene belonged to the p@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; who draws , should be aware of it - just like someone who goes to a pub that can complain there bad about noise . &quot;
&quot; all persons issued only with first name have asked , not to be called with their right name . &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organization .
&quot; furthermore , it is a social worker in the spot . &quot;
since July Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the Refu@@ ge@@ es for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ine is supporting the team of managing Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; it sees himself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working for refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else is involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from the working circle indicates that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is now here , that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is now here , the eag@@ le @-@ mi@@ tig@@ wo@@ e w@@ ool that has above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; so , some - less sp@@ ott@@ less than rather on the multitude of requested fields - meant to be targeted as the administration wanted to write . &quot;
&quot; was searched for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , connected with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a casual w@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; however , administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it comes to organisation , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as power @-@ value . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position on three years of temporary .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ ing and main actors are supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
new containers arrive soon in Was@@ hing road
&quot; a fatal problem has been to be found for some time , apartments for the connecting loop , which have been recognized . &quot;
&quot; for connection , the municipalities are responsible . &quot;
you must put the refugees in their own or log@@ ged living spaces .
&quot; the cost of building , rent or renov@@ ating these accommodations must pay the local itself . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the farm and to Comm@@ une and J@@ ob@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his accommodation . &quot;
the search for some time has been very difficult .
de facto management does not find private apartments .
&quot; so far it did not work , so far as one should rely on private apartments , so D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there must be common d@@ well@@ ings as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so soon , new containers will soon be placed in the washing track . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , those Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a solid be@@ er@@ be , it is practic@@ able , training courses , training courses , one @-@ euro jobs and hel@@ pl@@ ess for refugees and migrants that must be found or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building or help house ma@@ stered , do non @-@ profit work - and this motivated and very tidy , like Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive out@@ ward effect .
this is not a form of employment . &quot;
but activity does not mean to work .
&quot; the day bre@@ aches a fixed structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a aspirations of belonging .
&quot; so , it took offers like sport , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are r@@ ar .
so here also jump to manage and volunteer .
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they were welcomed in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the process is a problem .
&quot; you need to explain to the refugees that it takes and it can make a sense of mind over time , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who eventually develop the feeling that he could not help in Ur@@ bach , do not work , and be useless that will never integrate itself . &quot;
the distinct majority is motivated .
&quot; but there is also , customers honest , &quot; &quot; guys , where nothing is going on . &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
&quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two have been afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small community such as Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer very clearly , &quot; what man@@ holes may call nai@@ ve . &quot; a res@@ tr@@ isi@@ ko cannot and would not want to ex@@ clude them . &quot;
sensi@@ ti@@ zed are the hel@@ per but already .
these inci@@ dents were also subject to the refugees .
they would be afraid that the attacks bring them completely in re@@ vocation .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with that , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , main and volunteers must keep on site and in the region according to activities . &quot;
they always have in the background that a new p@@ unch of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a ceiling ?
to answer this question clear the policy .
&quot; actually , it is unfair to ask them hel@@ pers on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived there where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher are also involved in integrating the previous people to the present human beings .
&quot; this is currently about 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women are unified . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complex , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : crus@@ her with helic@@ op@@ ters
the police helic@@ opter flew around an hour in different areas - un@@ successful .
two un@@ familiar men are converted to a flat in an apartment house in a multi @-@ family house in the lin@@ den@@ weg .
the inhabitants killed the two and struck the b@@ hol@@ de into the escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 48 meters large , though mas@@ c@@ tioned , both Blu@@ e@@ je@@ ans and Black Kap@@ u@@ zen@@ berg@@ lis . &quot;
they whis@@ per@@ ed in the direction of downtown .
&quot; to the flag , the police set several stri@@ pe plants as well as a police helic@@ opter . &quot;
the susp@@ end ran without success .
perhaps the unknown before the apartment fell near the apartment or on their escape .
