<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">We invest in infrastructure and avoid the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"none of them are the two US presidential assessment, however, in tax and energy policies, as well as in a fundamental issue."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump seeks to hold the doubts rather small and warns about how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wool the economy of death and regulate them to death.</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different."</seg>
<seg id="9">"it will massively go back regulators, and it makes up a far-reaching tax reform with lower control sets strong - for individuals and for enterprises."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton on the other hand, says: the state has specific tasks to open up opportunities and needs money for it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, the taxes would increase for the rich, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the issue of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in fact, Trump and Clinton say almost wortequal."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic assessment announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teery-wing of the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"so, in Trump, you could also come to partial internal discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">"more clearly, the differences in the energy and climate policies are marked."</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-power plants and rebuild the coal production in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil-promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas, to terminate the Paris climate protection agreement."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton in contrast to further expanding the energies with its investment programme, and demands:" "a country will make the superpower of clean energy and create millions jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in infrastructure - also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away."</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP that transpacifish trade agreements do both not sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade but just to protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">The aim is to pay for better things about Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it on 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump does not want to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage is down, then he says he could not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months would probably rather likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand is Trump, who wants to cover the economy and the citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics point out to him, so that the deficit deficit would be just bigger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who want to ask at least from the rich, that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="2">"sexual violence is one of women who run alone, almost already for everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen sitting four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby here which is at the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">A little son placed in my arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He gucked with big eyes curious in the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother vibrates on the carpenter.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until they notice that it is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiled short and kissed the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene works normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it is part of Condrobs department, a carrier for social assistance services in Bavaria, and deals among other things with the subject of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are flashed.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in MÃ¼nchner north in one of the few decentralized accommodations for all affected women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs made the establishment together with Pro Familia and the MÃ¼nchner Women's relief.</seg>
<seg id="18">"since then, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men do not exist - also not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is an guard against the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here, has made experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men escape because of wars because they are persecuted because they threaten torture or death, or because their families will send them to hope for Europe."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women, other reasons for the run:" many steal themselves secretly for them, because they see no other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honesty or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run it goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs for instance require a bottle of water a sexual act is not rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end, as soon as they came in Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"again, single women in Refugees would often have been regarded as inferior and worse in cases."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to about 90 per cent of women who reside in the north of the MÃ¼nchner North, they appreciates them."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children were certainly not optional."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women were so used to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't have to speak openly about the experience, because the Schame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often do not help wrestless, it would need more accommodations just for them."</seg>
<seg id="37">The seven district authorities in Bavaria are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question whether they waver from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, some will answer some with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, there are something for example in accommodation of governments not."</seg>
<seg id="40">"also in Schwaben are not separate alone, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesperson of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Oberbayern, Lower and Middle-franken there are in some common shelters or private houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "rights of women and gender equality" in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study which was published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"lacks privacy, or are men and women to be accommodated, it can come to - continual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"most of all, the washing rooms should be easily accessible and easily accessible to women, stands in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel that need in need of this protection, it is possible to read the crowds that puts it to the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"ever spoken of itself has spoken to us, we have a long waist," says Bahr. "</seg>

<seg id="2">It was a gesture that a crisis ended.</seg>

<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his" dear friend "," according to a report full of five times. "</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he also spoke that relations with Russia would not only return to their old levels prior to the crisis, but can even be improved."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day described a newspaper that Erdogan would benefit, as if it had never been worse."</seg>
<seg id="11">I seemed to tell me more the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin radiant, sustainable bolle showed that the state of Russia was nothing forgotten."</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather the cause of the crisis was the first one mentioned in his introductions: the shoot of a Russian fighter plane was at the Syrian border with Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was curved.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to have fallen in his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The mistake was even greater since it was committed by a alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Vetrust restore it becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the nationally controlled media led a strong, unlimited attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">It seemed like the Turks would have to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the serious occasion, the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan benefited from illicit's own family from illicentering into Syria, which controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it is time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting was held only because Putin was granted the excuse to hear that he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the benefits of a ceasefire is clear on hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Erdogan requires all the friends that he can get, after spending the last month by a failed coupation of almost his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attack on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring millions of Russian tourists into the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is decreased by nearly 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are picked up again."</seg>
<seg id="33">They are counted on a late-season Andamm of the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>

<seg id="35">"a report made in Vedemosti says it:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is relieved in the West, since its reaction to trying to get a weak response to power."</seg>
<seg id="38">"this daily Groll will come across the snail out of the EU accession negotiations and Putin, the erunks to move from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the Russian State of Russia won in Ankara with security, that he called for the state-of-state support for the elected government bodies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is well-done for Moscow is a matter of course, which itself has a profound fear of regimitation."</seg>
<seg id="41">"meeting in this splendid palace at the sea, it enabled Russia and Turkey, a analyst how it was once a analyst once described," "alliance of outside," "two countries who come across from the West and have poorly dealt with."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, in spite of public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two countries."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference in Syria, where Moscow has recently joined the role of a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey have counterposed sites."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it might be significant that after almost three hours of first talks both Presidents met at the press conference, that they did not even comprehend the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in contrast, the President of Turkey avoided it to respond to a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found to Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dispaster, when NATO member would foss the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders at least talk again."</seg>

<seg id="5">The bank has since distanced itself since eight years ago she had to be almost collapsed and saved.</seg>
<seg id="6">"at this time, hallmarks" RBS "have used to protect other end-consumers."</seg>
<seg id="7">"she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from the Six Nations Rugby to the Wimbledon winner Andy Murray."</seg>
<seg id="8">But now she has decided to put more national brands into the focus.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initialized.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in England and Wales all RSB references, the decentralized headquarters and stock exchange at NatWest will change."</seg>
<seg id="11">The Ulster bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there are other smaller brands for private customer business, which will get more significance - Cout's, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank."</seg>
<seg id="13">McEwan was interviewed during a inspection route by customers and employees in Inverness-Shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">"he shared the BBC Scotland with:" "the RSB brand will become our Investors brand, as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we are now becoming a bank of brands."</seg>

<seg id="16">"now, I say that we do not pursue any global goals but local targets."</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these marks will be in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already argued that it will not continue his Six Nations sponsoring and that it will increase the perceptions of various brands in his sport sponsoring.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it is time for us to develop themselves to the Bank of the brands, because how do we concentrate in the inner (we have asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" "he said."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it would have been very cynical for three years ago, if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but with our work, focusing on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we can launch these brands again, so I think that the time has come."</seg>

<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV transmitter on Friday with that Ivanov has asked to leave his post and have recommended Vaino as its successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">To convince the smiling faces?</seg>

<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been president of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin's former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was the Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which was appointed the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his representative."</seg>
<seg id="28">As Putin sent to power he called Ivanov as one of five people who knew the most familiar.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once was believed that Ivanov could become President of Russia as a third term in Putin against the Constitution.</seg>

<seg id="5">"the time on screen was initially limited to TV, then on video games and last on smartphones."</seg>

<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns to health which want to bring people to" "take 30 minutes' to come", "from the sofa to come" and "to be active every day, because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable."</seg>

<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here."</seg>

<seg id="22">"there are three pillars of health covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people join the hunt even new friendships.</seg>

<seg id="9">"for frequently, social and family structures emerge from age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience also made Ursel Kipp in her chorus: "to speak and organize themselves to the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together.</seg>

<seg id="29">In search of the right offer have seniors different possibilities he says Hacker.</seg>
<seg id="30">"singer anyone from the acquaintances in a senior chorus, one can simply join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also provide overviews over the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">"who wants to sing in a church choir, can turn directly to the church or church officers."</seg>
<seg id="33">Many old-enchirs are also found on the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="1">The right "identity movement" is in the sight of the Federal Ministry for Constitutional Protection.</seg>
<seg id="2">After several nationals the constituarcher in the Bund defended the group under observation.</seg>
<seg id="3">"we see in the" identity movement "clue for aspirations for the free democratic basic regulation," said Constitutional Protection Hans-Georg Maate the German press agency in Berlin. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"thus, the migrants of other Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diffused in extremist fashion."</seg>
<seg id="5">That is why we are now watching the movement well.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the" identity movement "is a grouping with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it is applied against" "Multicultural-Wahn," "uncontrollable mass migration" "and the" loss of one's own identity by alienation. "</seg>
<seg id="8">"Stalin in nine states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - observe the" identity "already."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Maate said, his authority developed closely with the state of the state."</seg>
<seg id="10">"groups such as the 'identity movement' try to pick up their target group, where it stands," said the Constitutional Court. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"generally try to speak the extremists, they speak with anti-young speech, often with poppings music."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Islamists are just as right of extreme extremists.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is no concrete advertising for one's own cause.</seg>
<seg id="14">The propaganda will appeal to the people emotional.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are in a special way prone.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">"finally, from several federal states there have been reports of" "identity" "with AfD politicians."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Maate said, he did not have any findings."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the constituent manner, possible contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it depends on whether the particular party - in this case the AfD - by certain individuals, the extremist are changing and so fighting extremist."</seg>
<seg id="21">It is imperative that such people have a controlling influence on the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="23">"looking at the clear increase of legal crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps, Maate, he would not talk about new law in this context."</seg>
<seg id="24">But we found in recent years that it can give right-to-life structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There were the group 'Old School Society' or the 'Frialer group.</seg>
<seg id="26">"it can be quite that other legal groupings or small groups form, the attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee centres, or attack from other right-wing extremities are planned."</seg>
<seg id="27">A nationwide or Europe-wide control of rect@-@ rorism is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="28">The existing groups were on the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">"concerned, Mate spoke about that a lot of overgrips went to the account of people who were not in front of the right scene in front of us."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is the worrying.</seg>
<seg id="31">"many of the Tatry at asylum seekers were not previously known as criminals, politically motivated, offenders or supporters of the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="32">"many people have committed criminal offences, who previously had nothing at the hat, who were perhaps politically indifferent, or elected by CDU, SPD or left, which however must have radicalised by right-right wing mood."</seg>

<seg id="3">Demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia call for violent resistance from the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that zig protesting during the clashes with the police have been killed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to break up?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months protests against the government the country and extended into ever more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to roads and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was not unmerciful to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses spoke to that police officers went on heartbeat protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the circulation of well-being videos about the protests, which presumably run from the last or beginning of this year, how safety men will hit young people with poles, while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Authority on Human Rights is now calling for an ongoing investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country and in future it will become even more difficult," "Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group."</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expansionfounded in the considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure dramatically improved - there is a new pendator in the capital of Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"roads are generally quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"although Ethiopia has been anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations continued to dismiss the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country was limited, whereby anti-presidents have been effective in silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or in prison, were killed or rolled into the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and these have no other options except to protesting, it breaks off," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian Islands. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">"there are numerous complaints, which cover everything from the ground-use to the stranglehold imposed with regard to the power of the ruling coalition."</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a broad-abiding election last year, the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this two, controversial line called for hundreds of lives."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are afraid that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden have been more or less forced in recent years to take advantage of turbulence and arming themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of being faced with the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with social media, as cheap smartphones were more and more frequent and the internet services have been improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government does not lock access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, many people can still communicate via internet proxies to hide from where they are staying."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave them that they gathered themselves together.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons of prosperied the amharas, who come predominantly in Ethiopia, in the politics and economics, while they exploited the Oromos, many of which are many Muslims and live in flat-areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here, under a umbrella to coordinate", "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos."</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests occurred in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray which accounts around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in military services, in trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former vine-leader, was until his death at a non-publicized illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as the tactical genius, a man who could think corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analyst say that he was especially savvy in it, early signs of discontentment and to use special objects to handle opponents and make them inharmful."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is lacking in this basic skill," "Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopians of new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected from relatively undue reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region in northern India, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tigray controlled by the Tigray controlled safety services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the outcome will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time, Ethiopia has experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of elections were apparently colonized by the government and were subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raid warps many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in recent months and this time of unrest was relatively fast."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopians leader for their visionary infrastructure planning, as well as new tendings, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intensification of the internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month from attacked in Gondar, a amharian city, of Tigray guided shops and hatred towards the Tigray in social media is becoming more and more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that the protests persists the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for droneous flights over the neighboring Somalia, even though they have recently concluded that they have closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West wants to support the democracy clearly, he does not want his allies in an already volatified area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "Mr Abdi," "is a very thin wthunder migration."</seg>

<seg id="14">"at the end of July he had strong criticism on himself, when he said, the Russians were supposed to chop Mrs. Clintons Eemails, but later" "Of course, I said the sarcastically."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic borders in the policy and then rerowing back to demand.</seg>

<seg id="17">"but I also believe it is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defuse the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has taken an even greater note, because its survey values have gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, published on Friday, showed a tour with a big jump in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head-race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally tempted to apologize for its provocative utterance, he frequently accused his critics, dismissed his statements or to understand his humor."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but as he has reinforced the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal fellow-meeting to the uncomfortable situation to stand independently of how provocative might be his statements."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps most prominent intercessors, gave itself a great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments, so Mr. Giuliani said to the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements, Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had created the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown, small organization, he called her back-hers, was completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq."</seg>

<seg id="26">"before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and bowed them to ride his words upon each of his words."</seg>

<seg id="9">This longeance-shaped lifestyle seems to be a silver bullet for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the" "Science" "at any rate from a Greenland, which could be 392 years old."</seg>

<seg id="12">"though, the evolution of evolution has long been that Greenland hair will be stone."</seg>

<seg id="14">"Greenland-haie are difficult to observe, eventually they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive in the surface mostly only in winter. "</seg>
<seg id="16">About the lifestyle of Greenland-haie researchers do not know a little bit accordingly.</seg>

<seg id="18">"loot make this sharks anyway: in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had the jaw of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they chase them sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the Eismeeres and look for Kadaver that torches out from higher water layers to bottom torate.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland-sharks, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 at Greenland or Svalbard as a catch from the depth of North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long while the biggest 502 centimeters measure.</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed it with the carbon-14 method of the original-scale of the sharks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eyelet occurs already before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, as nuclear-weapon attempts to slate larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in that with 220 centimeters length, the original animal contained its low excess of carbon 14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday in 2012 with its study in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all the larger Greenland-haie had in their lens, with normal carbon-14 quantities, which emerges through cosmic radiation in the atmosphere."</seg>

<seg id="29">"Greenland-females only then get off, when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers able to allocate the length of an age."</seg>
<seg id="31">"because one of the animals was probably determined with 392 centimeters on the threshold of the sexually mature and his age ended with 156 years ago, GrÃ¶nland with the multiplication are obviously at least one and a half years."</seg>
<seg id="32">"also, this is likely to be world record for vertebrates."</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in eisitive waters is not accidental.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 year old GrÃ¶nland, in whose speck at the neck a 120 years old resin-tip that was captured before Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, it is often running to the organism of the animals living there."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to warm water in the cold water, the animals are also often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"for the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal leaves heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than in one gram.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as early as possible as many descendents," explains the evolutionary biologist. "</seg>

<seg id="11">"only privately-took the goal, but the change to company attacks occurred in the past months scary quickly."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works for a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it is specifically looking for incomplete files such as Word-, Excel- or database files, as well as for archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the demands of the prespresses.</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the files to the files, the victims need money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where with private use, the personal photo database is at stake, it goes with companies for sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production still stands."</seg>
<seg id="17">Consequently higher is the damage when a ransomware licks.</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected German companies affected by Ransomware, 13 per cent even had to disrupt the business operations, in a case people were living in living."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several times in Germany were victims of attacks, whose patients may be threatened by the loss of sickle."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the victims still: pays off, you therefore contributes to the problem," explains Klagynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their dates back."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers it is difficult, given the demand of perpetrators in operation to reject the demand of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker in turn know that and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the security researchers obtained from F-Secure the user surfaces and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to establish a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they declare their victims by chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, freely accessible support websites or decode any example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and become a private businesspeople, after payments of a few hundred Euros, companies need to get some hard on and pay five-digit sums in order to regain their data from uncoded."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risk-free gains from the Ransomware-blackmailing, the hacker is becoming more professional and share the work, explains safety expertly Chester Wisniewski from Antivirus-provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware approximately within one week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is however that it is about three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their pollutants then into the form of a software design.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the recent Malware kits created by the malware, advising and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in delivery is a adaptability tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The prespress are then looking for further hackers to spread the newly bought software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">"thus, you logged in one of the forums at the bottom, buy the set from a crime and commissioned an other way to install the software on as many PCs."</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per non-authenticated calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually confuse the criminals then spammer with the spread," explains Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known in many companies that make their data better secure.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies in the Malwarebytes survey trust in the Malwarebytes survey to be able to detonate Ransomware using file-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threat to successful investigation, the perpetrators are instead associated with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," "explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Klagynski."</seg>
<seg id="41">"thus, the damage to the type of data is still much higher than before."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in future, the perpetrators could be able to take completely new goals on the internet of things in the future."</seg>
<seg id="43">"on the Hackerode Defcon illustrated security researchers, how they could get used to control thermostat into their control with the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in the midst of winter, the Freetown of such a block victim could well be worth a ransom."</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the perpetrators then rather block the heating in the future a complete manufacturing road in a factory, Ransomware might also be a subject in Industry 4.0."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening, you walk down forever, at night you walk twisting in the morning, in the morning, too far before the Weckerring will no longer think of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute about one quarter of adult sufferers and more than ten per cent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as unrelaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be multiple causes underlying by Hans-GÃ¼nter WeeÃ, executive member of the German Society for sleeping-research and dormitory."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what you understand, but the insomnia, so is an inhalation and a sleeving."</seg>
<seg id="8">"right now, many people feel as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, Voroscillator in the German state-association with practice in the Saxon-Saxon Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind bedsteal?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind this, organic, mental or waste-related factors, but also drugs are stuck."</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the sleeptive expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early waking up is often associated with depression," says Weaving. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors would like to each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who, for example, has a case of disagreement, can be poorly lying, wacht every two to three hours and starts urgency to pondering about everyday problems and paving, there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">From when to go with sleeping disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"whoever does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and the day is affected, should go to the doctor, betrayed Weaving."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment may look very different: one is depressed, tired, unaused, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has a moods or bodily ache as stomach or headaches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate the sleeptive, it is important to find out the causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"as treatment options are used among other things such as therapy, a cognitive behavioural therapy or also drugs - classical body-coated tablet only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquestion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"precipitation sleeves are hardly supported in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary, medical center of the CharitÃ© UniversitÃ¤tsmedizin Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, one should first consult with sleep problems initially to the primary care provider."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified with examinations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who was supposed to go to sleep, and what happens there?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for examining in the sleeping laboratory equipment, for example, in snoring with respiratory diseases, in case-taking care of sleep, or if one does not find the cause of a siness," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="27">You really need to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a midday," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after leaving, one goes to his normal time in bed."</seg>

<seg id="23">There was no other street this year was mentioned as often together with the words "linksautonome authority."</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason that not all neighbours can see that as a problem, could be affected by the crime; crimes such as bodily injury are based almost exclusively against police officers."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the biggest part of the offences are made in the conditions of the crimes, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial of 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as far as violence did, she is confusing: people in the 94 are their neighbours who were not sure."</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars put it directly in the Rigaer no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for who studied architects, their street is not a crime burning, on the contrary," "here one helps each other, lives along the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has deliberately left the rigaer street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">"that's why it was also so important that the inhabitants have regained their road: from police, politics and the media, which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city in July."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of female artists such as Neugebauer, the road will continue to take them away: through the reboundless new buildings in former buildings, that hurry the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are all condominium apartments, which are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so well stunned," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "violence and destruction I can absolutely not approve."</seg>
<seg id="35">"but what should we do, if one never hears someone?"</seg>
<seg id="36">"frustration, there is frustration on all pages of frustration, even in the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">"for the drawn up, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house-projects and the left scene belonged to the pines."</seg>
<seg id="38">"who draws, should be aware of it - just like someone who goes to a pub that can complain there bad about noise."</seg>
<seg id="39">"all persons issued only with first name have asked, not to be called with their right name."</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organization.</seg>
<seg id="3">"furthermore, it is a social worker in the spot."</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle is the Refugees for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogine is supporting the team of managing Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">"it sees himself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working for refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else is involved."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Regine customer from the working circle indicates that Deuschle is now here, that Deuschle is now here, the eagle-mitigwoe wool that has above all a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"so, some - less spottless than rather on the multitude of requested fields - meant to be targeted as the administration wanted to write."</seg>
<seg id="9">"was searched for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, connected with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just a casual wool."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it comes to organisation, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as power-value."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position on three years of temporary.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle honing and main actors are supported. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers arrive soon in Washing road</seg>
<seg id="17">"a fatal problem has been to be found for some time, apartments for the connecting loop, which have been recognized."</seg>
<seg id="18">"for connection, the municipalities are responsible."</seg>
<seg id="19">You must put the refugees in their own or logged living spaces.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the cost of building, rent or renovating these accommodations must pay the local itself."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the farm and to Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his accommodation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search for some time has been very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto management does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far it did not work, so far as one should rely on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, there must be common dwellings as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so soon, new containers will soon be placed in the washing track."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, those Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a solid beerbe, it is practicable, training courses, training courses, one-euro jobs and helpless for refugees and migrants that must be found or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building or help house mastered, do non-profit work - and this motivated and very tidy, like Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive outward effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is not a form of employment. "</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not mean to work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day breaches a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a aspirations of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so, it took offers like sport, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here also jump to manage and volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they were welcomed in Germany and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the process is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"you need to explain to the refugees that it takes and it can make a sense of mind over time, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who eventually develop the feeling that he could not help in Urbach, do not work, and be useless that will never integrate itself."</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there is also, customers honest," "guys, where nothing is going on." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others. "</seg>
<seg id="47">"all this is already a" "mammoth task." ""</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two have been afraid of radicalization, even in a small community such as Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine customer very clearly, "what manholes may call naive." a restrisiko cannot and would not want to exclude them. "</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitized are the helper but already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would be afraid that the attacks bring them completely in revocation.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with that," says Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, main and volunteers must keep on site and in the region according to activities."</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that a new punch of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a ceiling?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clear the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to ask them helpers on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not arrived there where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher are also involved in integrating the previous people to the present human beings.</seg>
<seg id="63">"this is currently about 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women are unified."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complex, there are no simple answers."</seg>
