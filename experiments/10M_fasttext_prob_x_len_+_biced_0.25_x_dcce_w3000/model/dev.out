Obama receiving pro
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not straight @-@ friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of an international agreement and backing backing to the dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; but for the meeting , it should also be a question of the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been stra@@ ined for years .
Washington has criti@@ ci@@ zed the constant sett@@ ling of Israel and poses a lacks approach to the peace process .
&quot; through the deal of Obama &apos;s deal , Deal for the Iranian nuclear programme has deterior@@ ated the relationship of the two further deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in March , he had held a controversial speech at the invitation of Republi@@ cans before the U.S. congress held a controversial speech against Obama &apos;s intervention . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the upcoming election in Israel . &quot;
in a call @-@ up Professor to have shot his girlfriend
&quot; in a not@@ ebook , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on represented with a somewhat z@@ itt@@ y voice of the police , that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; represented it was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said , the family contact the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , officials found the Lei@@ che of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written notice , I wanted it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was the only woman , signed up in the letter , and he was signed by him . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that he represented in two online courses for the Delta State University in C@@ lev@@ eland , Mississippi , moved already 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was shot of the police a popular histori@@ an Professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door of his office and killed . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ tit@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that Univers@@ es staff at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock have heard .
he said that he did the fatal emergency call sometime after .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : Lamb occupied himself as the police picked him . &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting at the University , students and faculty to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what is represented . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators on both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees , who knew him , helped us understand a picture of an talented but possibly difficult teachers . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to their lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said , he did not have a history of violence or a criminal history . &quot;
he himself referred to a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with which he shared his academic life .
&quot; both subjects in the department for social sciences and history , whose faculty were 17 members , and many students visited classes of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some incl@@ ines to problem@@ atic behavior .
&quot; a student , fire on be@@ avers , the Lamb , he said also was a little excited and ed@@ gy , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that I told him he was at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress . &quot;
Lamb previously had asked the Delta State University to have asked for health reasons and said he had any other health problem .
in this year he only put two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in the employment policy of the university signi@@ fied that the promotion , for the Lamb worked so hard for him to represent no guarantee for an automatic way to a position as a Assistant . &quot;
&quot; Universal President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he wis@@ er nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs Presentation . &quot;
these are questions that could not be answered anymore .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police subsequently found a trace , when he returned to Mississippi from Ark@@ ansas import@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still running into the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why Lamb was on this house , but Johnson said that she knew the people who saw there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; he started his work at the university , which has 3.@@ 500 students in a town with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he rehear@@ sed in the spring in ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends lam@@ bs described it as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Carla H@@ air@@ ston told , she was 15 and lam@@ b as she met through joint friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool guy guy who tried to teach it the guitar playing . &quot;
he was then the women &apos;s warm .
&quot; all the girls are mel@@ ted , when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now live 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I did my wife killed , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog called Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick @-@ house , adjacent to a seaside hotel in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was in order .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were 15 years ago , but friends have stayed and a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; it was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; he never met , he never met , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and played music . &quot;
he met Pr@@ enti@@ ss between he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail three years ago both on a summer fair .
&quot; later , they played together one or another one . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings in her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse practi@@ sed for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sh@@ af@@ fer , a bar@@ man and sometimes enter@@ tain@@ ement coordin@@ ator at The Jul@@ ep Room , said that he &apos;s represented and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5 . September for the last time , he finished his guitar and harmon@@ ic@@ asp@@ iel ended before a sp@@ ective audience . &quot;
there was no sign of that anything wrong .
&quot; simply just a happy pair , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the dre@@ aming and jo@@ ys with each other .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of shame . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the initial semester program and specialized in American native peoples and colonial history , Don All@@ an Mitchell , an English @-@ professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ansas and was President of his Br@@ otherhood and the Advisory Committee .
&quot; at the Delta State campus in C@@ lev@@ eland on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including lectur@@ ers , employees , students and members of the community participate in a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight Mem@@ ber@@ ing party . &quot;

&quot; Associ@@ ated Press author Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans carried the report to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected , to seal the police now says that he wrote the call , and that the Lamb recorded in his call of Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever got married . &quot;

&quot; Secretary @-@ General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says that its response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of lasting conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;

8 survey values that are showing that Donald Tru@@ mp is seriously to take .
some have tried to brand him as a flop @-@ brand .
others have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try , Donald Tru@@ mp are trying from the top ranks in surveys using , it has ( yet ) does not work . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys , Donald Tru@@ mp proved to be a two @-@ dig@@ it area , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the odds of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
none of claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphas@@ ise that at this time in 2011 , Per@@ r@@ ys was given guidance to the rising Herman C@@ ain , of which none of them had a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but foreign groups such as J@@ eb Bus@@ h Super P@@ AC and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mp@@ s per@@ sever@@ ance and start to rush their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values which indicate that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary period :
Tru@@ mp@@ s Beli@@ ever have turned around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced its can@@ did@@ acy in the middle of June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two out of ten republi@@ cans had a positive impact . &quot;
by mid July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
&quot; now , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
some three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
these figures remain in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac @-@ vote in Io@@ wa has found last week that 60 percent of the republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the republi@@ cans , they would be either &quot; delighted &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot;
&quot; just two out of 10 say they would be &quot; angry , &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son just creates the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say , they were &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent , that would say the same about Tru@@ mp ) . &quot;
who next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio at only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of republi@@ can voters tell that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the Favor@@ it of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the Candi@@ date . &quot;
a majority of the Republi@@ cans visu@@ alizes Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely considered to critic@@ ises his bom@@ bas@@ tic and insul@@ ating statements , 52 percent of the former Russian voters gave the real tem@@ per for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is valid in the first op@@ tionally @-@ state of the nation , the federal state Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ can think that he has the personality for a com@@ mander @-@ in , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless 44 per cent believed that he did not have the personality to effectively apply his ministry , and nearly six of 10 Independent states that his temper@@ ament does not head to the White House , so ABC / mail . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; if they turn their conc@@ essions , the Republi@@ can voters commit Tru@@ mp is real . &quot;
&quot; if you are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from the last week four of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
that &apos;s a change since time when four out of ten came out of their money to J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P @-@ elect@@ ors in the past did not have the cryst@@ all@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten republi@@ cans , that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination towards just 28 % for the final candidates , Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; however , a large number of GO@@ P @-@ voters can be seen as a plau@@ sible change . &quot;
&quot; even when the Republi@@ can gathered themselves to another candidate , Tru@@ mp is still nearly every one . &quot;
some experts suggest that the sh@@ atter@@ ing field would probably contribute to tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s guidance while the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is being distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most of the other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he found before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points lead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , prior to Walker 15 points , before Y@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally on the edge of Paul , John Ka@@ der and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only Candi@@ date that strikes it ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take entrepreneurs with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald @-@ Tru@@ mp @-@ fans tells that they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday showed that only slightly more than half of the voters decide to support Tru@@ mp &apos;s voters , say they will have the votes made . &quot;
&quot; of course , a lot has happened to change that , and no one can truly say that never mind . &quot;
&quot; 46 percent said that they leave the door open , to switch to other candidates . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s is strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ sider , the neurolog@@ ist Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they are in agreement with Tru@@ mp .
&quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp was called &quot; &quot; Rap@@ ist &quot; &quot; in his election campaign against two months ago , was the immigration of the migration and fishing point in public discourse . &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ bas@@ tic out@@ si@@ zing of Tru@@ mp is vital H@@ isp@@ ano American by the Republi@@ can party and is hop@@ ed the re @-@ orientation effort .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey from Monday , six of 10 Republi@@ cans , that they agree with Tru@@ mp in questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; as long as it remains in the li@@ mel@@ ight , Donald Tru@@ mp will appear to do so . &quot;
the fru@@ stration over the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
&quot; by Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly through their out@@ sider . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey of D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in Io@@ wa over two weeks ago shows that three of four Io@@ wa republi@@ cans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ can in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; polite . &quot; &quot;

a new study shows in which special runs a square meter most costs .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top @-@ sites comes one of the price but like pe@@ anu@@ ts .

Champions League : Bavaria @-@ Traum@@ start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
two @-@ fold scor@@ er in Piraeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has simply a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller @-@ blessed the FC Bayern the way to a earned 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pir@@ ate - then ran .
a sou@@ ver@@ er attachment of the Champions League season .
the World Champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have captured a dream start in the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of Trainer PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola won their pr@@ el@@ ude in the Champions League at the Greek Rec@@ ord@@ master Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to the tr@@ ash double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and dol hits its ( 8@@ 9 ) deserves 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ f@@ th race success in the series is supposed to be the first step towards Fin@@ als on 28 May 2016 , where Guardi@@ ola will finally take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich . &quot;
Müller received in the Champions League at the Champions League of the Bav@@ arian Chamber @-@ winning Mi@@ th@@ ilfe of Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto which pass a as a fl@@ ke after the World &apos;s favor .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , had promised Bavaria captain Philip Lah@@ m before the game in the Car@@ ais@@ ak@@ akis stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot fans - and the Mün@@ ch@@ ner held . &quot;
&quot; they showed a concentrated and engaged performance , without sh@@ iny . &quot;
&quot; Piraeus had won his latest six home games in the royal class , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , A@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 also here Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but the Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up duo with Greek teams were un@@ defeated , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
they went bra@@ bly to work with their offensive efforts but often to mon@@ ey@@ ed work .
the attacks became often accompanied by playing p@@ adding to el@@ sau@@ ces Douglas Costa and is rarely en@@ forced against the earlier Br@@ uns@@ wick Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck on the right than its fl@@ ank from the right half @-@ field in the left upper edge of the finish .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world Champion gave the potential 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first as the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown proposed the head of Poland by the line ( 26 ) .
&quot; then by cont@@ ention , the go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper Roberto with the knee ( 35@@ . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bavaria are used to be dominant game , Pi@@ re@@ ign@@ y was able to set out . &quot;
on door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel Neu@@ er was Lost .
&quot; for example , as he had a shot of ide@@ ye about the lat@@ te len@@ ils ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; before New he made guar@@ dian of a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre of Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Götz@@ e , after mus@@ cular problems back in the ca@@ der , sat at first outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero was given after the final training green light , he said sport proposes Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , this is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; even at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him , when he brought King@@ sl@@ ey Com@@ an for the attached Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot;
&quot; id@@ ols arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6 ) and 13 minutes later everything was clear , by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller made it a dr@@ one . &quot;
in front of the game it was in the stadium for Kra@@ w@@ alle .
&quot; after a smaller group of some ver@@ m@@ um@@ m@@ ed Bayern @-@ fans in their audience @-@ Block , obviously , who had prov@@ oked the supporters of Pir@@ ate with words and ges@@ tures , attacked the security forces and went with drums against the Mün@@ ch@@ ner followers . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was transported from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth &quot;
&quot; those who smoke , fail so not only the lungs , but also the teeth - which lays down a Potsdam @-@ long @-@ term study . &quot;
good news : rel@@ ieve the risk fast .
smokers have a significantly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
&quot; this has emerged from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smokers there was the risk to lose their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely , to lose the 2,5@@ - up to 3,@@ 6 @-@ fold . &quot;
the researchers had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
&quot; cause of dentists are car@@ ies , and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ va , empha@@ sizes DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis is smoking a risk factor but stress the authors .
the connection between smoking and dental loss therefore do not go back to frequent g@@ ums in smokers .
&quot; not clear , however , smoking also raises the risk to tooth dec@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; men who c@@ eased with smoking , their risk could however be decre@@ asing within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could last more than ten years until the haz@@ ard resum@@ ed to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained T@@ aut@@ or Thomas Diet@@ rich at the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; people must convince people of it , non @-@ smokers who stated a Boeing H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; smoking shorten@@ ed the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
not to smoke is good for lung and tubes and leads to our findings also to a good tooth health to the high age .
&quot; over 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 have been affected by dentistry , the DI@@ f@@ E shared with us . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking is the risk of early co@@ bal@@ dness .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ p@@ inning the findings .

EU Commission propos@@ ing a new court in dispute
&quot; on the resolution of the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement , TTIP has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private sub@@ ordination for disputes between companies and states are therefore to be dis@@ solved by a transpar@@ ant system , which in its mode of functioning clearly more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that trusted citizens &quot; &quot; stated Cecilia Malm@@ ström in the right direction . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Schw@@ ed@@ in proposes to bring the proposal as a European negotiating stage to the US &apos;s free trade agreements with the US . &quot;
the German government announced assistance .
TTIP is intended to create the largest free @-@ trade zone of the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the arbit@@ ration proceedings depend on the fact that the EU states and the US will jointly select independent judges for a new investment fund . &quot;
&quot; they are supposed to come to equal amounts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
for the first time this is also a second instance .
it would allow it to raise against jud@@ gements .
&quot; so far the procedures involved with each other on the arbit@@ er , a in@@ consistency of their jud@@ g@@ ments were not given . &quot;
&quot; in the recent months debate , citizens have become clear that the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fairness and justice does not trust , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it wants to work according to its own information to a global investment course . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clari@@ fied . &quot;
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration demanded above all ( IS@@ DS ) as one of the main reasons for the widespread resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ rators are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ judicial system , concerning the company &apos;s damages caused by tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws of finance or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in first comments , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act passed the proposals by the European Commission as insufficient . &quot;
&quot; critic@@ ised above all , that they should not be considered for the already negotiated free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) . &quot;
the German economic @-@ state Secretary Matthias Mach@@ ined ( SPD ) marked the plans as a major step forward .
&quot; the Commission nomin@@ ates significant points on reform major points , the German economic Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked out in the spring with other EU Trade Department of Commerce . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als be from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
&quot; before that , the European Union association Busin@@ ess@@ Europe became , which limit the economy to limit the economy through too many new rules . &quot;
&quot; particularly small and medium enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , it was meant . &quot;
&quot; when the talks about the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) will be concluded , on Wednesday remained unknown . &quot;
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
but the issue of investment protection has not been discussed with the United States so far .
originally a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year .
this date is no longer available .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns de@@ buted on the questions of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns de@@ buted in the questions of the Prime Minister with tension expected
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is to give his debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise up on the first of his six @-@ set questions shortly after lunch while his performance by the media is likely and will be checked out by the Labour MEPs .
he called &quot; less theat@@ res and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could over@@ ski@@ p some sessions to leave them to their colleagues .
&quot; meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ etts and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the decision of the Labour president , on Tuesday , during the singing of the National Bank during a commemor@@ ative ceremony to commemor@@ ate the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , and is at the center of several title @-@ stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ te decision to sing not the national hy@@ m@@ ns has attracted attention
&quot; a spokes@@ man told Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; &quot; respectful of silence &quot; &quot; and he made the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the air dr@@ au@@ ght by England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour @-@ Chairman , the National Bank Chairman , &quot; regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they refer to differences in economics , defense and foreign affairs , while less than a Six@@ th of the Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary party supported him as a leader . &quot;
the pol@@ tical correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be st@@ acked in the Labour Party as well as Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns statements about the position of the European Union and the limit upon profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference to put Labour amendments to the whole idea of a limit overall .
&quot; Mr Smith , the shadow work@@ - and pensions minister , that the party &quot; very clear &quot; is that they will only be against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26.@@ ,000 pounds to 23,@@ 000 pounds . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he has been a leader in the parliament in the last decade . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader who promised a different policy set , says that he has given &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and has given him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the prime minister of the Prime Minister is too con@@ front@@ ational , and that it has been suppres@@ sed both &quot; &quot; sacrific@@ ing &quot; &quot; and the dispute with resistance , and to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Ms Eagle , the shadows of the British minister will represent him if he does not participate - for example if Mr. Cameron is on his way abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation , that other colleagues occasionally seized the word , and that he said John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the sub@@ station , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became the leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron spoke that he is linked from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ Theatre &quot; , &quot; who is often linked to the questions of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he pointed out that he has failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was first sent in 1990 in 1990 , the question got dealt with the prime minister of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position in the House of Commons and his position among his member states , although critics argue that they become a caric@@ ature and bed@@ ding far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

&quot; the pound increased according to data , which show an increase in wage growth by the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the don@@ key target SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot;
between May and July the result grew without bonuses in the United Kingdom by 2.9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
that percentage had been the fastest and en@@ ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents above the time of a interest au@@ ction .
&quot; the pound increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar on $ 1,@@ 55@@ 05 and was up to 40 % compared to the euro on 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase in 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29.@@ 21 .
&quot; SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % , having received an acquisition of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v . &quot;

the Managing Director of J@@ D sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; can mean more department in the po@@ ckets of the potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely that this department would cost the higher labour costs at his company , &quot; says he . &quot;

inspired by the Sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; potato m@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster the PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A Movement has sent Al@@ h@@ ay Pot@@ ato and meat to a sk@@ ewer .
&quot; the idea brought him to the idea at a PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of &quot; &quot; potatoes &quot; &quot; that he was viewed by television . &quot;
&quot; since then , in his shop , a bar@@ bec@@ c was sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
the idea has become the Leb@@ anese in the meantime in the patent office in Munich .

Met@@ rology starts Con@@ tract for the fight against Al@@ di@@ - unity
met@@ ron@@ age tries to protect the Ig@@ A @-@ Fili@@ ales in front of a Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholesale distributors has launched a Con@@ tract campaign to defend the market share of the Ig@@ A Ret@@ ails in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di will prepare the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , strengthen metro@@ cash and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarket their relations with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A through mainstre@@ am media and marketing over social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A @-@ ret@@ ailer and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ic@@ king S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ borough , who distri@@ butes in Ig@@ A @-@ Shops and shop@@ ke@@ epers , selling tickets for the South Australian football @-@ liga to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to report further details of his defence strategy on 29 September , when the wholesale catalog for food , alcohol and devices have passed through its annual Invest@@ ors &quot; . &quot; &quot;
it is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ stor@@ ie and higher profits as a met@@ g@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ Network in the East @-@ states .
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared with about 14 per cent in Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; however , an@@ al@@ ysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di twelve months after opening his first markets to take around five percent of the food market in these two states and will take part in all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report posted in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley that Ig@@ A @-@ ret@@ ailer 360 million revenue per year and will lose 250 million $ by the end of 2016 . &quot;
the progn@@ osis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will be launched in the next year 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and will achieve a turnover of 500 million and 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss of food and grocery and with the amounts on Met@@ cas@@ cade &apos;s high fixed cost may be met@@ cash about 13 million dollars before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the Eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and CO@@ LES , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A @-@ travelers are the most trust@@ worthy . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley accepts that Met@@ cas@@ hs sales in food and grocery stores by 3.8 percent in 2017 and 2.4 per cent in 2017 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading fund managers ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , with a business eating in Melbourne , that Met@@ rology will likely disappear within a decade . &quot;
cash to cash it off to publicly respond to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of met@@ cash will be contacted by Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; IC@@ As &apos;s market share has declined since 2010 by 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ cas@@ hs dietary and food trading , which has been reduced by 43 percent , which is at low @-@ time pressure on revenues and mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; wholes@@ alers surplus , however , and inv@@ ests more than 150 million $ , sal@@ ut@@ ations with CO@@ LES and Wo@@ ol@@ ung@@ ths at hundreds of products every week , and Ig@@ A retailers in improving their shops through fast growing fresh foods and to deliver better choice of private @-@ label food . &quot;
Met@@ cas@@ hs main business guide Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price customiz@@ ations and charging programs to be submitted and hopes that the wholesale distributor in 2017 for the first time in four years will return to a profit growth .
Th@@ an@@ asi co@@ kin@@ aki is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve Heal@@ y
Th@@ an@@ asi co@@ kin@@ aki deserves praise as criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; in the recent storm round his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and deserves to consider the President of the Australian tennis association Steve Heal@@ y rather praise as criticism for his own behaviour .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the youngest of talented Du@@ os , who is always referred to as a &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; by the in@@ famous examination of K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os with st@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ inka and the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after they had to be separated from Kok@@ kin@@ akis , and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison was separated twice by the refer@@ ee , whereas Har@@ rison would have to strike , and I should strike the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et , having failed a potential US Open @-@ victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ akis was defended by Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in the second place in the individual behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup finals against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing I am talking about myself is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi has been drawn somewhat into the dispute , &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; he has broken one r@@ ack@@ et in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but really , he really beh@@ aved in the U.S. Open extremely well , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison , and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around him and I believe that he was treated a little too strictly . &quot;
&quot; he is a very rei@@ fer 19 year old , he works hard , and he doesn &apos;t fit in the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stur@@ dy and mature young guy , and I believe it deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; Heal@@ y also supported the decision to take account of K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os in the important decision @-@ making , and he describes the &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term component into the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is concentrated completely on the competition , and not on all the contro@@ versy with around &#91; K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I think that Nick was very quickly made the ascent , what people like Feder@@ er and Murray have pointed out and deserves all the criticism that he gets , but we try to give him the consequences of his actions . some time outside the li@@ mel@@ ight , in which he can only think about it , and it is best for the crew and it &apos;s the best for him . &quot;
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains the border that keeps refugees back
&quot; Hungary declares the emergency and turned the south @-@ border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the parties trying to come into the land . all with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
chaos followed the border as hundreds of migrants studied in a ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Serbian officials involved with rebellion .
&quot; people who have fled before violence , st@@ ained for an unknown period in a country ro@@ am on the road between the two check@@ points of the countries and built up tents , and settled there . &quot;
but fru@@ stration come up .
&quot; as a police helic@@ opter about them sh@@ ou@@ ted , ch@@ andi@@ ze the migrants &quot; open the border ! &quot; and cri@@ ed Bel@@ ts against the Hungarian Traditional police force . &quot;
some made up of protest food and water back .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign ministers declared , &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; that migrants would be returned from Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ater@@ als .
&quot; in the coming days talks will have to take place in Brussels and other countries , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence of the hung@@ arian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ nations blo@@ c in a str@@ ingent meeting in Brussels and could not agree on joint immigration policy .
&quot; however , the Ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who settled in the out@@ puri@@ fied Italy and Greece . they oppressed her hope that finally - next month , or until the end of the year - an agreement would make that the EU states would also include other 120@@ .000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
but Hungary did not oppose his hopes for an extended promotion of Brussels or its neighbours .
&quot; the Emer@@ ging Emer@@ ging Emer@@ gency in two southern regions gave authority more powers to get out of the crisis , so they could save roads and asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country has also built the construction of a bar@@ bed wi@@ red along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after having finished a fence at the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pr@@ isons in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence , between Hungary and Serbia were invited . &quot;
in recent months Hungary has become a significant military @-@ pass for many war fle@@ ets in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic migrants are those looking for a better life and not war fle@@ ets who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in contradiction to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws that occurred at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the fron@@ tier or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ us to educate the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws put even higher death penalty for condemned populations . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of affairs , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs re@@ por@@ ters in the southern City of Sz@@ eged . &quot;
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree to the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but re@@ por@@ ter from Associ@@ ated Press reported it difficult to armed forces with vehicles and dogs in days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , country security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities were 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country . &quot;
they come across by ou@@ tre@@ ach the fence and are now being accused of enforcement of criminal off@@ ences in accordance with the new laws .
authorities are here to fix the fence .
&quot; Hungarian officials also joined two of the seven border transfer with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos conver@@ ged the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ ar@@ opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and supp@@ ress a crowd . &quot;
&quot; about 20 years , there were up to come , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
&quot; a further group of migrants turned the main highway between Serbia and Hungary , and told that they would give food and water to go to Hungary . &quot;
choice @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Cl@@ int@@ on Vor@@ sprung before Ber@@ nie S@@ ander in national survey hal@@ ved
&quot; the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to keep a two @-@ dig@@ it lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders will win it towards the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has support 47 percent of democratic voters in elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders will be second in second place , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not proclaimed nor did he stand for the presidential guard , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic elections of the presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; over five months prior to elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion will be determined and candidates will support them . &quot;
but cl@@ int@@ ons supporters are more pre@@ conceived in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton had lost in a number of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders had some profit achieved . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a big advantage in women and ar@@ tery , but these changes have reduced . &quot;
&quot; your support in the men is clearly lower , and S@@ anders will be back here only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ ass@@ on &apos;s advantage of democratic constitu@@ ents under 50 years has become viol@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same altitude . &quot;
Clinton is still a big advantage with the older voters .
&quot; last month Clinton was in front of a two @-@ dig@@ it head start with the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders put a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters of the presidential elections say , Clinton would support Clinton if they would be nominated by the Party . &quot;
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Cl@@ int@@ ons are current supporters especially from it .
&quot; the views are more powerful , with those who do not currently support Clinton - just about a quarter would be delighted to support them . &quot;
&quot; during 48 per cent of the democratic voters of the elections , Clinton can support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less Republi@@ can voters this over their top kan@@ di@@ daten by Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; when Cl@@ ass@@ on supporters can be asked in an open question why they want them that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidate for job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; from Cl@@ int@@ ons supporters , their connection with Bill Clinton is also mentioned ( 9 percent ) . &quot;
consent to dealing with the problems and the elect@@ or@@ ability are also c@@ ited .
&quot; since the Vice President casts a potential for the presidential shell , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third does not believe it should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters of the elections were asked , who for the party would be their second choice is Bi@@ den at the top . &quot;
Cl@@ ass@@ on &apos;s followers say more than half that bi@@ ds would choose their second choice far from S@@ int@@ ons .
&quot; decide , not to run for the nom@@ ination of Democrats , elevated Hill@@ ary Cl@@ int@@ ons Vor@@ sprung from S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ den in competition on 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win the election ; however , this figure has fallen by 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; bid@@ ding is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; chosen &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in the question of what is more important to a candidates , democracy &apos;s voters call on a vot@@ ee . &quot;
similar to last month is not a single democratic candidate or a potential candidate for these voters of the elections as unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates will achieve good results in some important characteristics of the elections of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong man@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ ds f@@ ted the three candidates best with honest@@ y , while Cl@@ ass@@ on &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe , Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the elections usually see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
about a quarter of democratic voters did not give any opinion to say about a quarter of democratic voters .
&quot; with questions concerning Hill@@ ary Cl@@ int@@ ons , use of a personal email address and one server during the term as the State Department , most of the Democratic voters of the elections are satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say that their opinions are not in general . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of the Americans are now disp@@ le@@ ased with their explanation as only about a third is satisfied .
&quot; public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light , split . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ versy had no effect on its general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent told that their opinion has still deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy of their party , this continues to be a problem for them under a registered voters : just 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight per cent less than last month and 15 points less for May . &quot;
62 percent of the elect@@ or@@ ate hold them not for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of the elect@@ or@@ ate fores@@ ee@@ able also see Tru@@ mp as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp however receive good notes at guidance .
&quot; from the six tested candidates Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best tested with honest@@ y . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards himself as an honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the trou@@ bles@@ hooting for the sample of 351 Democratic voters at the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves to agricultural pol@@ l near Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times - behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; at the two candidates , half of the support of the voters falls in the new survey , and others lost dramatically . &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can voters assist land@@ wide further Tru@@ mp in large numbers . the support grows of 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted before Fox News debate last month by 27 % in the survey dated Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son f@@ oss the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son meets demo@@ graphic groups well and embr@@ aced Tru@@ mp amongst republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ uns , is dis@@ regarded with Wis@@ con@@ sor Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who dropped the deepest and indeed from 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; the former Florida @-@ Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ark@@ ansas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located at 6 % on the third place . &quot;
trou@@ bles@@ hooting at the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was performed in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was last week shows that Car@@ son started in the surveys - he lands with 19 % support in the republi@@ cans , behind the tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post was also displayed Tru@@ mp in front of Car@@ son .
&quot; with views of one last week rising Car@@ son found Tru@@ mp some side effects for the former neurolog@@ ist surgeon , even after Car@@ son is ap@@ olog@@ ised to ask Tru@@ mp@@ s faith in question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp on last Saturday during a campaign show in Io@@ wa . &quot;
pleasant bathing @-@ temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean at the moment is up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even though outstanding values are measured only in the distance , enough for swi@@ m@@ lau@@ ber can already be a blast from the Mediterranean to still find warm water . &quot;
a dip in North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a little bit of fun at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; there is no longer going into the sea : no more than 18 degrees , the water in the north and Baltic Sea during this week , shares the German Wetter@@ dienst ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , bath @-@ temperatures also continues to offer the Mediterranean : in the East it even comes up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , there are at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;

five members of the Br@@ otherhood has deb@@ ited five members of the Br@@ otherhood with the death of a bar@@ b College .
&quot; almost two years after a student in a schi@@ er@@ ous ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ an@@ sen are filed against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of New York &apos;s Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ si @-@ Br@@ otherhood , Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g took brutal during an introduc@@ tory meeting in September 2013 and declare his transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , shared the police with him . &quot;
&quot; officials said , he had been loaded with his eyes with a 30 @-@ pound ru@@ cks@@ ack with sand , and repeated , while he tried to go over a frozen field on a goal . &quot;
Mr. Den@@ g def@@ endant finally over head@@ aches . then he fell unconscious .
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ si Br@@ otherhood does not called the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g impot@@ ent was impot@@ ent and claimed an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , his symptoms to goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g to take the national president of the Br@@ otherhood to seek advice , Mr Poli@@ mark@@ ef Chris Wagner on a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point the members to hide and put the welfare of the Br@@ otherhood generally about the by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ mark@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not revi@@ ved , and he died early in the next morning . &quot;
&quot; once again , Den@@ g is repeated with st@@ umped strength injuries of head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the chic@@ ane of the Br@@ otherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 every year to the chic@@ ane , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s Family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accountable , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e received an indic@@ t@@ ment because of the third Gr@@ ades for the first five members .
&quot; two thirty members of the Br@@ otherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with bloody crimes and education of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we not only want to be responsible for the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or officially - this s@@ ank@@ ering , we will also hold them accountable , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Br@@ otherhood , and the national frat@@ ernity has vo@@ ke its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed has increased interest rates
&quot; as a fork carriage , and the hous@@ eb@@ se will get into the w@@ aking , return for bonds will rise , and the economy will float up in a recession . &quot;
this is what we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it takes everything and how long it will hold .
&quot; in particular , the history for the economy offers only small instructions on the exp@@ ir@@ ation . &quot;
a recession came in only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggression of the Federal Reserve upon raising the interest rates is often , al@@ beit not always , a factor in how economy and financial investments respond . &quot;
&quot; as a result , representatives of the U.S. central bank have stressed that investors should not focus on when it starts to increase the interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , market participants could find that the whole excitement because of a fork @-@ cave may possibly be exagger@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inev@@ itably made by some as a signal for the end of the era of the &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Executive at Capital Economics , in a Communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to fear the se@@ is@@ mic shock , which many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is one of the historical trends such as some areas in the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of Zin@@ no@@ ca@@ vities can make things for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase meets , the influence is not as dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that wealth produced 12 to 24 months after the first increase will be cancelled , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank Analy@@ st in a newer study on what is going to interests of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market is usually published in the last 35 years - about 14 per cent - on the way to fork @-@ growth , rather flat in the 250 days later ( average profit of 2.9 % ) , then back to normal result , the Bob D@@ oll , Chief Executive Board of Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published in Bar@@ ron &apos;s Asset Management . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the stocks are falling rapidly in the c@@ eas@@ e@@ cycle and the returns with it begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic activity but Zin@@ no@@ ca@@ vities are encouraging them often .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is facing some conditions that had not existed before and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;
extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product is in the vicinity of its lowest point at a fork carriage of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interests of Russia rose only twice the nominal GDP only under 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was by 3,@@ 6 percent , only few expect that this will last and expect to settle for the third quarter in terms of Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; zinc under@@ sets in such a frag@@ mentary economic setting might be ris@@ ky and cast the question , &quot; if it is this time different , &quot; said the German bank . &quot;
&quot; participants have taken over the whole year into a landing stage of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed towards the session of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many shr@@ ine and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could have an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trade is only a chance of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all H@@ unting cycles of 1950 to today have taken place in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum when GDP had taken place and on @-@ side treatment very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows &quot; , &quot; so the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which has been awaiting the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession , the record was 35 months and this has been 74 months . &quot;
&quot; the firm income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , since the market takes part in a fork carriage , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than with shares when they change their strategic target .
&quot; at bonds , the return seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase in lowering is made in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the meeting @-@ cycle , the lei@@ ds fall away , the German bank said . &quot;
&quot; the Str@@ at@@ egen of Charles Schw@@ ab do believe that the increase in the interest rates will result , that return must be closer together between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a det@@ ach@@ ment of the curve . &quot;
&quot; bonds often bring better income , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher y@@ ields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting is , Jones , that the markets have already been adjusted to F@@ ed strategy . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are a few signs that the market has adapted to the views of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest are increased , the yield @-@ load is increased , credit @-@ ups have increased and the vol@@ ati@@ lity has increased - all characteristics of the market once the F@@ ed sharp@@ ens its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and whole , companies that benefit the greater part of their operations in the United States , benefit if interest rates desc@@ end and local products more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multination@@ als with high debts are worse , since an increased dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also fund their debts . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares are to be extremely positive in three months after initial investment growth , &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man &apos;s analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet have passed the balance sheet after each of the growth period 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at an average of 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital return as well as low vol@@ ati@@ lity in their shares even exceed their counter@@ parts with low quality at the average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will be a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; outside of pure share , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollars . &quot;
&quot; austerity could see profits from higher income , even if experts are of different opinion , how fast it will take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham
the Conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament criti@@ ci@@ zed the sender of his &quot; distor@@ tion &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly being distingu@@ is@@ hable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted on the BBC Music Awards and said that she im@@ ited just The Br@@ its
EP @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien broke the mission of The Voice and said that this is not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading parliamentary member and raises new pressure on the sender , to prove that he does something what the private sen@@ ders do not do . &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham was also said to have the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses , that the public @-@ legal radio show &quot; become fool@@ ish@@ ly &quot; and can no longer be distinguished by its commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 does not seem - I use the word &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also quoted on the BBC Music Awards which started in the last December start@@ up .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , the Br@@ its seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples , where you actually only im@@ i@@ ble what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
&quot; BBC @-@ Direc@@ tor@@ ate rejected the accus@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial ri@@ vals , when it comes to live music and enlightenment . &quot;
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , that will not be anywhere else on classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly un@@ matched .
&quot; and the commitment of radio 3 , to find new music and give new works on order , I consider it really important . &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; earlier this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that harder to work on to get the audience when it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio , however , was not the only element of the BBC production working during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport carried out under fire , the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MEP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins , The Voice of the BBC - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for estimated costs of 22 million £ . &quot;
&quot; do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not especially distinctive ? &quot;
Lord Hall was insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - &quot; produced in special BBC fashion .
he added that he wants the company to find a hit from our in @-@ house stable when the next time it was a entertainment series .
&quot; however , he refused to ex@@ clude the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or to spend money on the tax@@ pay@@ ers for other funding formats . &quot;
Internet survey participants in August at the slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for this .
&quot; during the first three months of 2015 , there have been seven percent increase in online selling . &quot;
in the last month there was the lowest result since the commen@@ cement of the year 2000
online sales increased three years ago through the use of cell@@ phones to shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has stopped their issues
&quot; for over a decade the virtual shopping now belongs , and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain have turned into a spirit @-@ cities . &quot;
experts say that there are now signs that online changes will st@@ agn@@ ate just seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
&quot; the total expenditure on August represented the lowest increase in growth since the start of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot;
experts say that there are signs that online sales will st@@ agn@@ ate after emerging figures only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , that has always been developing in the course of time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG @-@ selling of the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that the online sales had increased three years ago , as a vend@@ or , with their mobile purchases . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now this is the one , and we may possibly experience that the growth will be reduced . &quot;
&quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which has been imported from America , is being c@@ ited as a reason for wan@@ ing revenues . &quot;
experts believe that buyer will hold their sh@@ opp@@ ings before this event which takes place last Friday in November .
&quot; in the past year , five times the average number of buyers for their computers , to make their fri@@ ction , and some ret@@ ailer sites . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , on which the shop@@ pers were cl@@ ashed because of bar@@ gain , buyers can prevent sh@@ opp@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium came out , that of 5 £ 1,000 is spent a little more than 1 £ online . &quot;
&quot; with some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web @-@ shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of the people clothing and shoes online instead of in the mos@@ ets in the inside . &quot;

&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man reported that which caused the overthrow of the Crane , which occurred in a courtyard of grandparents , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims took place in the month , which were held later in this month . &quot;

Mrs Lau@@ ry says she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are met by women .
at the moment we ou@@ tw@@ eig@@ h the men .
&quot; she said it is necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends that show more female single households , the more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to shift that stronger towards a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our customers are made up of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry who is one of the leading companies listed by just five women to the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index listed company has also re@@ designed her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in executive positions .
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that has occupied precisely 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial status . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our super@@ visory boards .
King@@ fis@@ her postpon@@ ed a decline in half @-@ year results and the ou@@ tre@@ aches after the group costs the cost of the closing of the stores .
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has , around 200 new branches . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ I / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity
at the Court of Kl@@ agen@@ furt during the Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball @-@ runner A@@ I / DO@@ B had to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and spending .
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them had been charged with am@@ t@@ sm@@ iss@@ use .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he had been acqu@@ itted more strongly in May . &quot;
the present process was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the ground @-@ state , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the pre @-@ investigations that the accused in the years 2006 to 2011 will be able to disp@@ atch them in their functions , dispos@@ ed for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage was related to some 400,000 Euros . &quot;
the sporting facilities are also charged with financial transfers .
&quot; this Fac@@ acy was the Chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , Rich@@ mond Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later time .
&quot; in the re@@ pro@@ ach of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the Defence presented that there was not an asset that the association had not been an asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports feder@@ ations would have been compens@@ ated for compensation and the sports club , for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , passing from the debts - the Pas@@ va opened in 2001 around 600,000 Sch@@ illing ( rd . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time we were standing in front of the situation : do we run the club or block it ? , &quot; one of the def@@ endants , in the Br@@ ot@@ elle Grand @-@ company of finance . &quot;
&quot; together with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have taken money , our life insurance as a safety in the bank was pur@@ ged , &quot; he said when in@@ comes . &quot;
&quot; with the association been agreed , you cannot manage the money , there are only no debt to be made . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it has been approved - if corresponding financial - success have been approved by the payment of spl@@ itting up by the end of 1991 . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , one section of the spl@@ itting up damage was only years later , namely from the year 2003 when a plus has been in the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , be@@ es must also be l@@ ump @-@ pri@@ chal@@ ance and non @-@ detail watches , &quot; the former ob@@ el@@ mann explained the proceedings . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and Spar@@ ks saved the two def@@ endants in common , said the second accused . &quot;
&quot; why the pay@@ outs of the association had not been instrumental in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association was not interested in detail for financial support , but it is important for debt freedom , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 against the one functional investigations , an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the Club account . &quot;
&quot; bom@@ bers would have been , explained the def@@ endants . &quot;
this securities account ran out on the name of the second accused and according to his statement by the association was not known .
&quot; why ? , &quot; did the judge know . &quot;
after that the qu@@ asked for a long time didn &apos;t know the answer .
&quot; and finally he said , he believed that this is the best for the association . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody wouldn &apos;t have known anything of that money , the prosec@@ utor filed in the room . &quot;
&quot; the ten@@ sion@@ ist has been informed continuously , justi@@ fies the official . &quot;
this transfer was formulated as &quot; claim @-@ proof &quot; .
why damage claims ? we wanted to know the judge and prosec@@ utor .
&quot; finally , the first accused , he did not agree with this wording as the association was never caused by the association . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; with whom you are all out of the hook . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
&quot; furthermore , the official said , he never issued a pen@@ ny content , he only comp@@ uted few kilometres and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; di@@ ets he made the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , however he added . &quot;
precise documents for the early years could not advance the def@@ endants .
&quot; they were judged for an examination , in which everything has been considered correct , no longer un@@ saved , explained it . &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter@@ ms had also taken the second accused .
&quot; all containers can be made in cash , in addition , he has to drive from his home to the Bank to B@@ lei@@ fe , he stated in his statement . &quot;
the main proceedings will be continued on the 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard two more 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition , for three years in running time the computer @-@ gra@@ vit@@ ese is carried out during the spl@@ itting of the company more jobs . &quot;
the job@@ arrangements with the US @-@ Compu@@ Tr@@ ese Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) no end .
&quot; the US @-@ Technology Group is planning the dismant@@ ling of 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its corporate client . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the costs amount to EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.7 billion ) shall save the company on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of around € 2,@@ 7 billion that will start in the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the removal of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed . &quot;
&quot; HP dealt with the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , even approximately 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;

the Grand Ball@@ ast Group from the C@@ alifor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto spl@@ its itself to : this is the case that the computer and pressure business will be bund@@ led even h@@ euer in a new society - separate from the ongoing area with computer servers and data store for companies as well as other services .
both business changes are to be not@@ ated at the stock market .

&quot; in the third quarter , sales of PCs and printers had gone back to 11,@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion .
&quot; thus , the proceeds in 15 of 16 quarters went back . &quot;
HP answers the changes in the industry with a break @-@ up and massive job walks on the changes in the industry .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : non @-@ excav@@ ation in the Serbian border
the Hungarian police has employed at the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water@@ lights used against several hundred refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Boz@@ si@@ k has experienced the atro@@ city in the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees cross the border .
behind it there had been a police line and behind the police officers was prepared a water designer .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees began with stones , sticks and plastic bottles according to the officers . &quot;
the officials took first un@@ interrupted pepper spray .
then the police used mo@@ ur@@ stri@@ a .
much tears have been spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
&quot; thus , the group was dis@@ solved . &quot;
the refugees have now with@@ drawn somewhat .
a pregnant and clearly in@@ ju@@ red woman was borne out of the zone .
&quot; children , who had din@@ ed the gi@@ eng@@ ar , cri@@ ed out . &quot;
other refugees dro@@ wned in himself and suffered under breathing problems .
&quot; also , the spokes@@ person of Serbian police suffered injuries by the use of ben@@ ches and pepper spray . &quot;
time to decide on interest rates for the U.S.
&quot; the world is observed if the US central bank on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , comes together to meet the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates are raised . &quot;
&quot; survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were asked by Reu@@ ters found that a little bit more than half , which last week was that the F@@ ed will do this now , now that the F@@ ed will continue to do a little longer and the interest rates at the current state of 0 - 0.25 percent will keep . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest on NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we approach the situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and starts a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , leading staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance , tri@@ llion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate only a small inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less harsh view of global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs suggest that the odds against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision is scheduled to be announced at 8 : 00 AM CET on Thursday
death scor@@ er at Delta State University leaving the ap@@ dig@@ it
&quot; after the shoot and k@@ ill@@ ings of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning , and before he killed him on the day his colleague and killed , Sh@@ ann@@ on wrote a note to say that it would be &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; during the first murder and wanted , &quot; &quot; he could happen to happen &quot; , &quot; gave authority on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that he &apos;s lectur@@ er for geography and socio @-@ scientific education at the Delta State University , calling the emergency number from 10 : 00 to Monday morning . &quot;
and he said he was shot at someone and somebody killed .
he &apos;s told the staff of the emergency that the police polic@@ emen had to send to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I terri@@ fy my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is &quot; &quot; in the house , but who &quot; &quot; nobody will inter@@ fere , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller name according to his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lamb was no explanation for his shots .
&quot; as the police of the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of represented , 45 , the said , &quot; I am sorry , I could not do it . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , 300 miles from the Delta State University , where he worked as a professor for history , killed , before completing his own life on Monday night when polic@@ emen took him over . &quot;
&quot; Universal President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he wis@@ er nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs Presentation . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , which supposedly supposedly felt that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt on Tuesday , there was no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; to a &quot; tri@@ angular relationships . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss were told by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she was about seven years married as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced from 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , &quot; &quot; he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 and she was destroyed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were his daughter &quot; absolutely best friends .
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss were online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day K@@ now@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who poss@@ essed a dog called Light@@ ning , had hit him for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said K@@ now@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , he said to a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; he did not go to the prison . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a police officers arrived at the Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , he went by car to the side , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
he received a doctoral title in the spring 2015 by the Delta State University like its li@@ fes@@ sions on the University &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group
the Lufthansa is planning a big concert building .
&quot; at least half a billion euros a year , the Lufthansa group wants to save alone with a better organisation . &quot;
150 of the world &apos;s around 1000 executives will cost the workplace at the stage .
with the pilot &apos;s union there is in@@ let new negotiations .
&quot; the Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure , and it adds value to the total Euro@@ wings . &quot;
&quot; the goal of the real@@ ign@@ ment is a result of around 500 million euros per year from cost and solution syner@@ gies , shared the airline on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , there is no more to be the passenger on the passenger in the future . &quot;
the cheapest way of Euro@@ wings should be developed as independent as possible .
&quot; in the pre @-@ stand@@ alone team for the Car@@ sten Pro@@ oh@@ r , in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in future . &quot;
&quot; with the new presentation , Sp@@ oh@@ r empha@@ sizes the importance of Euro@@ wings , which the Group wants to continue to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet . &quot;
&quot; to date , the organization of 120 000 employees has been complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines &quot; &quot; airlines &quot; &quot; belong to the roof of the passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;
new negotiations with the Pil@@ ots
&quot; in the collective @-@ conflict with the Pilot@@ en@@ vereinigung cock@@ pit ( VC ) , the negotiations will be added after the court of strike on that Thursday . &quot;
shared the trade union with them .
the theme of the talks will be the retirement rule for pil@@ ots .
cock@@ pit &quot; &quot; set up for the results in a year with a projected engine rate &quot; as soon as possible . &quot;
the conflict between union and Air@@ line led to several strikes in the past few months .
&quot; in addition to the transi@@ tional provision of the pil@@ ots , the spar@@ ate concept &quot; Wings . &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can not play for a monthly frac@@ ture for dou@@ bling
Luke Sha@@ w suffered at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven a double frac@@ ture of his right leg .
&quot; while this has brought the left external def@@ enders for wines and ex@@ clude him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al cannot hope that Sha@@ w again can play in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack of H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before going to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg ac@@ upuncture and lies in the hospital . &quot;
he will leave tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it is horrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it really hard and then fantastic playing , and then happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had a oxygen @-@ mask on the spot .
he cri@@ ed .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then it takes six months and it won &apos;t play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
Moreno seemed to be happy to escape a Red Card and the suspension of a iv@@ ory .
&quot; Nicola Riz@@ z@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not pun@@ ished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ er had to be mist@@ aken .
&quot; you can judge for yourself , if I say that a El@@ f@@ meter and a red card was required . &quot;
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account were : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my journey to recovery begins now , I come back stronger again . &quot;
testim@@ onials : Manchester United had the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat at the PS@@ V
the England def@@ ender has an added incentive to recover from the European Championship in France to recover from the next June .
&quot; Philli@@ p C@@ oc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; It is a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player with this kind of injury the place leaves everyone very sad .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
&quot; Moreno suffered a break @-@ in , when Mexico was playing against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the World Cup 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , this is not good , &quot; said C@@ oc@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , who was heading in another direction , so it looked out when he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; talking with SB@@ S@@ 6 said Moreno : &quot; I know how it feels like , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad there . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ Player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also transferred to hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ ation by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron The Lor@@ ax is better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents are soon learning : if your child loves a book , it will not be long before you know it almost completely . &quot;
&quot; unless , you are David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite child &apos;s manual was decided to be the prime minister for The Lor@@ ax , which f@@ lowed in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , it writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and goes on : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message ; it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , as there is always an image or a message which we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron is alleg@@ edly described the action of the book , instead a content creation of the film version of 2012 re@@ produces , the new characters and details added to expand the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville where all nature has gone and even the air is a merchandise , hopes to see the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , fulfilling his desire to see a real tree , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage was ho@@ ver@@ ted and the 1991 passed , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this would not be suspic@@ ious enough : the text presents himself as part of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is leaving the story of the book so little . here &apos;s an un@@ named boy , like the local environment by the Emb@@ ro@@ ying Lor@@ ax , a hock@@ ey character , &quot; which is called the name of the trees &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR @-@ task was deleg@@ ated to a volunteer , the The Lor@@ ax has not been read a child for 20 times in a row . &quot;
a down@@ ing Street @-@ Spe@@ aker said that the text was probably come from Cam@@ er@@ on &apos;s electoral office .
&quot; Super@@ camp confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ ons has been supplied , but were no more immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still hard . &quot;
&quot; to come across Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if you &apos;ve chosen the kay@@ aks to have selected the UK for the tour is a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 Test series production not on my map . &quot;
I would not ex@@ clude an aw@@ down@@ victory .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks page is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing march , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry a y@@ er@@ se from 2012 , only a y@@ outh@@ ful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; the ball develops Mo@@ een Ali as a spin @-@ Cable and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; in this case @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th , came out of the England Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ it . &quot;
&quot; letting out Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as being his boss in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyse . &quot;
&quot; with its seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player can be achieved . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark for Joe Roo@@ t , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago one could have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny . &quot;
if he will hopefully turn additional shops for Yor@@ k@@ shire has another chance .
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even though he did not bring so good performances and I don &apos;t surprised me ; he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test string gets to get his character is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son prior to him , while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton has got the chance to do home and look @-@ up .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can rise up , was that England first made Jonathan in the Caribbean , but this lost chance is now in the past - but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
Alex Hal@@ ey comes in and he is a stroke that I highly appreciate .
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he posted 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he has to obtain at least the same chances as those preceding it , but of course it depends on the team of teams in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to leave Mo@@ een next to Cook , what would offer an extra @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and four qu@@ icks would get , mixed up , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a perc@@ ep@@ man can not hit there , and these left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een may not have his job for his County Wor@@ ces@@ ter@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before in 2001 as Open@@ er came up in 2001 .
he immediately made a hundred cr@@ acks and didn &apos;t come back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited treatment with him he was very impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people might see his statistics on an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no great number of backup de@@ co@@ ders who collect their hands and the coach have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the crew , England has made some smart supplements on the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Lu@@ awar@@ de@@ an , the Bat@@ sman from Sri Lanka , as consultant for the test games could be a master@@ coup . &quot;
he is one of the nicest guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experience since it has played on all the conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball @-@ phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he is created for international cri@@ cket competition , as player or as coach ; and as Mah@@ ela , he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices in the locker room can bring fresh air , even if the messages are in line with what happened before . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ ok@@ es , is not employed with the One @-@ Day@@ ers , Roo@@ t received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and Team@@ leaders do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that players will depend on their jobs of the results .
such decisions are not made easy to heart .

&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ balanced new cell strategy to keep Britain in the EU , will turn out deeper into difficulties with every day , even without choosing the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which were fier@@ cely due to Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners have also their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Nig@@ el Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at mess@@ y said , &quot; &quot; said that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angl@@ ed in various crises , as the EU is now , and not always from their own guilt - Britain itself created an agenda with seg@@ mented terms and conditions that they usually do not want to be filled . &quot;
&quot; in Bright@@ on , TU@@ C decided on its annual assembly that it does not like that if they risk the social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie Agenda .
&quot; prime minister and finance ministers at meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals make a photo of itself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they will win allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who want an outside UK in the interior of the EU Zel@@ tes - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and leaves us that more and more short @-@ sight@@ ed ministers and officials came to the point where it does not matter if we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s careful ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an association , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the post before it looks bad for them as it is in the exagger@@ ated ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a bl@@ ending force .
&quot; Poland could soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain an lef@@ tist side . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they will be a be@@ ad to help remove the Sel@@ f@@ ie British to prevent their energy better , Scotland &apos;s out@@ let from the UK should prevent it - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , possibly some such ministers may even conc@@ ise not helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P @-@ style , while the UK refer@@ en@@ dum@@ pl@@ amp@@ agne 2017 to speed the Bre@@ xit process , suspected my boyfriend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt , and &apos; Great Britain has won &apos;t the value of the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
Europeans know how r@@ amp@@ ly the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU @-@ scep@@ tic is the oligar@@ chy of the Press@@ eb@@ ar@@ one but did not have it during the Tony Ben@@ n inspired refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms in 1975 but did not support our entrance 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; they can remember devoted to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who made a name as an &quot; &quot; EU @-@ line ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ er years . &quot;
with all his mad@@ ness he knew Ed Mili@@ band who were his enemies .
&quot; in addition , the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ feared sh@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ y emig@@ rants and the pseudo @-@ in@@ ventions which possess the most of our large newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bl@@ air actually thought about her , but realized that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you are getting better ban@@ anas in order to distr@@ act him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as Bl@@ air itself , as he denied Cam@@ ero@@ on refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms@@ bel because he denied the principle of the non @-@ adopted Constitution of the EU , which were then opened by French and Dutch voters in 2005 . &quot;
the press has never missed him too .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me on Monday in Westminster , a friendly cl@@ ap on the back - I told him that he didn &apos;t need to waste time for me - seems to repeat no time more for me - seems to repeat strategy of the 80 @-@ er years , a mistake at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but it must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa has left on Sunday . &quot;
the Cor@@ by@@ te official position on Europe is - I guess it was friendly - in the development .
he says that we should stay in a reform@@ ist EU .
&quot; well , most people outside the rock @-@ ups traditional blood @-@ fuel @-@ tendency and the wild p@@ fil@@ ement of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say any more yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Ben@@ n@@ ite , Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said , as the boy sc@@ outs in it fought , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ te appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ he years , when his old father struck himself on television , to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet , without losing too far and losing its cabinet @-@ job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ &apos;s battle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight , in order to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - by no expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what Y@@ C told its co@@ ar@@ ites and members according to all reports on their clause on Monday . &quot;
&quot; whatever the tou@@ ching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even has stir@@ red - News - discipline remains essential in the age of TV around the clock , and above all in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a brood @-@ site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ y@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it is right , Cameron don &apos;t give free tickets for Europe that allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ en@@ dum@@ pl@@ ess for a matter of course , like Mc@@ Donn@@ ell it said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins think of sure .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ ui@@ ties on EU membership - in line with its ben@@ n@@ ite Belgian economy , her anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ si@@ m of the small sub@@ sum@@ s that is a central principle by dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ ui@@ ties to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C will not start a campaign to res@@ ign@@ ing - will foreign diplom@@ ats oblig@@ ated to try to find foreign diplom@@ ats , in all , to find a sense of their appearance at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin do political capital - they have also become suspic@@ ious voters to the British - if this can be point@@ less ?
&quot; the U.S. have already been quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a re@@ pro@@ ation of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of something about the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise the report of Public Health England via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; declar@@ ations of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people , partly with ties to tobacco industry , told researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) was Lanc@@ et to critic@@ ise the by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes used .
he published the &quot; Mani@@ fes@@ to report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the res@@ ili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month took the &quot; &quot; very win@@ dy basis &quot; , &quot; on the p@@ hic his most important conclusion . &quot;
&quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; are up on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tro@@ pical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Immun@@ ology at University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies must be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expected that the claim of p@@ he is that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes is based around 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modeling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria tri@@ ision analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to guide their opinions about the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine hal@@ ogen@@ ated products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director received prior to British American Tob@@ acco Middle Ages ( BA@@ T ) . &quot;
&quot; he also wrote the references of BA@@ T for publicity health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants declared the meeting declared a means of an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer but not financing that he should have received after reports prior to tobacco use Philip Morris International , they added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for choosing the members of the body are not delivered but includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes , some of which also provide a branch of industry financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the min@@ ors took part of the p@@ he .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; fl@@ ees b@@ yp@@ ass &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the declar@@ ations of p@@ he that there is so far no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes serve as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
&quot; pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and well @-@ being at p@@ he said that the alleg@@ ations of BM@@ J was previously responded . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
&quot; all the evidence , close that health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes compared to that are small but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the unique obligation to inform the public of what evidence shows , and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about relative danger related to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0,000 people die annually on a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system two billion £ a year . &quot;
&quot; clear signs of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC is to give up East@@ En@@ ders , says former Chief of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said , the BBC should stop , programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broad@@ casting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK sender .
&quot; he criti@@ ci@@ zed the BBC , that they are probably seen by a smaller audience , which probably can be seen from a smaller audience , in hard disp@@ uted time windows of the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ Director , Tony Hall , the company said to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he has tried out for six years in his time with Channel 4 without success , with the BBC in contact . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs could be commissioned or sends , who also clearly showed it not sub@@ ordin@@ ated ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communic@@ ations Committee under his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broad@@ casting fee , what I consider medium or long @-@ term not for a good idea , one should not do its production at least to programs which do not make or commissioned . &quot;
they send the Voice in a first @-@ class window because they want to achieve a maximum possible support for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this , is a joke , it is ridicul@@ ous , it is of course nonsense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs which could be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program ; East@@ en@@ ders is another to ad@@ mitt@@ edly both original productions .
&quot; frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I would be afraid to see how this should be public @-@ legal TV .
I don &apos;t believe that this would be the BBC ever at all .
&quot; Johnson , a entrepreneurs for series , from channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for the hunt for evalu@@ ations &quot; &quot; because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular ship@@ ments of the BBC give up what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Con@@ gart presentation at Edinburgh in 2003 decided that the BBC shows how to sell the East@@ En@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal niche programmes were to be measured on BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can not measure the audience , but they do argue if they have issued on their seem@@ ing missions to justi@@ fication of 4 billion £ Rund@@ funk@@ tions , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have seen all these ob@@ sc@@ ents programs which no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window in which no one wanted to see them .
&quot; on the broad@@ casting fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that may receive the best value . &quot;
&quot; of course , all of us think that one gets a great value for 150 £ a year , but for those who &apos;s a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me whether this is true , because they consume not much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ board and Channel 5 @-@ Chief David El@@ stein , who also told the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to educate and maintain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little by the BBC @-@ production would now officially be classified as education - he said that there was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on radio - and it should take a look at the publicly @-@ legal TV broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; to the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC has to do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television was shown to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos; Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound @-@ waves
&quot; the video shows how the Nem@@ ira change the direction at the moment , in which it will be pun@@ ched with Klang@@ impul@@ ses . &quot;
scientists have bred in wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified organisms systems which are controlled by br@@ other@@ ses of mu@@ k@@ shafts .
&quot; the win@@ em@@ ato@@ graphic change the direction in the moment , in which they have shown with sound impul@@ ses , which for human hearing too high frequencies have to be heard , be pun@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; the impul@@ ses are working through the switching of m@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ cells , which are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultr@@ as@@ ound . &quot;
further on this topic : researchers read and write Brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics , in which ultr@@ as@@ ound can be used to activate a series of brain , heart and muscle cells out of the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Bh@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian , that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure , which gives electrical impul@@ ses into the brain of people for treatment of Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; nu@@ di@@ es usually react not to ultr@@ as@@ ound , but Sk@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , reinforce the ultr@@ as@@ ound waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the reinforced ultr@@ as@@ ound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the sub@@ mer@@ gers .
&quot; the no@@ un@@ es effect the opening of these I@@ onic channels and activate the cells they are assigned , so a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultr@@ as@@ ound Nem@@ ato@@ des , the Sk@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ics TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ onic channels carry . &quot;
&quot; when he turns ultr@@ as@@ ound on the changed creatures , the sound waves are reinforced by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and passed into the wor@@ ms where they turn the changed m@@ oths . &quot;
&quot; the process has several simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a pioneering tool , which allows scientists to interv@@ ene in neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light . &quot;
but Hal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ris@@ e@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; unlike light , which has to be sent at an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ as@@ ound fabric can pass through and can thus be sent back to the brain from above on the sk@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make human neur@@ ons temporarily pr@@ one to the ultr@@ as@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insul@@ in @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student homes
&quot; eleven years ago I moved as self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the tense smile of those that I have angry - and in the numerous , long @-@ sized complaints about others . &quot;
&quot; most of what I have learned , can be di@@ sti@@ lled in eight simple rules . &quot;
the withdrawal in student @-@ liv@@ ing@@ ling ranges from easy nerve wre@@ cking up to absolutely fright@@ ening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell where you come , where and where you &apos;ve been taken , where you are going to know with Cor@@ by@@ n and why you can honestly say Mar@@ m@@ ite neither hate nor hate yourself , because in the Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a He@@ ise Plant@@ ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you to figure out the people that you like , in contrast to those with whom you wouldn &apos;t talk , even if your eyelashes are gr@@ ated in fire and fire extingu@@ ishers . &quot;
let people know .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into drinks recipes , film night venues and municipal meeting points but they are also places where people prefer and under@@ wear them . &quot;
below : do not remember to start the university with a relationship
In@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted received a cru@@ de treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refu@@ ge , but many student dormit@@ ory forms a space @-@ to @-@ space @-@ man@@ um@@ mel @-@ culture , the friendly and social life and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
&quot; this can be the hell for someone , who is trying to recover . &quot;
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I will , that our friendship goes on , but you have to go away , so that I get back the energy back that I consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
&quot; try to sense when a comm@@ ent@@ ment is exhausted from convi@@ vi@@ ality , and send it to him an SMS instead . &quot;
A@@ pro@@ pos . do it : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ory had the idea that a non @-@ executed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by B@@ aking .
&quot; since you start the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ie , the clo@@ ckers to the doors of people to imagine , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have to give you something baked . so , and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
homemade delicacies is a good way to make friends .
their ro@@ omm@@ ates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain yourself and will halt at the end maybe your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; mixed m@@ ugs from flour , sugar and gre@@ ase lead that people make themselves sleeping if you anchor . &quot;
to ste@@ al food is a primary crime in student dormit@@ ory .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ aws of chickens is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check it with the milk owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook in the inside . &quot;
&quot; when someone turns your stuff , this is annoying , and you have my compassion , but try to deal with it as a ro@@ ommate that added to their milk and pun@@ ish some th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
she is now in prison .
you should not make noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent human being , but that you belong in the true sense of the pro@@ verb to the people who are in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my hall asked her neighbors , whether it turns them something out , Drum &amp; Bass somewhat qui@@ eter , because it was three in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
you re@@ acted on this with even more lu@@ ke@@ able music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she sent her own music , she completed her door and ended up to her three @-@ hour examination . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would happen to be tou@@ ching in the same student dormit@@ ory ?
&quot; in turn , it would not be aby@@ sm@@ ly embarrass@@ ed if you separate a ro@@ ommate for your future couple , to separate yourself and then experience it every day and maybe experience how to spread all together friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own paths - but if a hot co @-@ residence is definitely not your future pair of sp@@ ouses , try to talk at least to talk to your sub@@ li@@ b a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in an exciting moment , in which you notice , that someone has its key in his non @-@ filled room , is the border between a Ul@@ k and har@@ ass@@ ment fin@@ alist as it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good thir@@ st is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes the bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
pass through tr@@ ap a valuable and am@@ using fl@@ ection on safety - but swe@@ ep you to someone &apos;s rooms with to@@ oth@@ paste and sh@@ amp@@ oo .
&quot; close your door , and place your key in a glass of water , which you then put in the free@@ zer -- but T@@ ack@@ er@@ cis@@ ed your pos@@ sessions at the ceiling no more than twice . &quot;
&quot; town@@ houses for refugees , single @-@ moving , for@@ ing@@ ers &quot;
&quot; the Real Estate contractor Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds Rei@@ h@@ enh@@ äuser , which did not have much money . &quot;
&quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need d@@ well@@ ings , but also the educ@@ ative mother and the righteous worship . &quot;
&quot; I am showing how to continue to work very cheap and well @-@ priced , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
the ent@@ repr@@ en@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner thinks to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created : he builds a project town@@ houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , a lot of refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
what solution are you offering ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : mass properties in containers or turn@@ around has no sustainability .
for people remain a big part here .
&quot; in view of the refugee stream , we also need the living space in the next decades . &quot;
a great ban@@ qu@@ ated wh@@ ouse is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a town@@ house needs the least place .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
that is different if one sub@@ mer@@ ing the people in the blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residen@@ ces for four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees will say , it is peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be changed easily to the respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house was reduced to € 184 , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six months construction has lasted .
this is appropriate .
do the building rules have their plans to complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : I have moved my project correctly .
particularly complicated makes it always the dro@@ pping D@@ amo@@ is r@@ int special structure and the job @-@ space .
cre@@ epy .
&quot; it is still under@@ signed , who creates three apartments in a town@@ house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities is missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the community react to their maturity project ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : there were what they were accused of creating , super@@ structure for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
what is definitely not right .
&quot; but , do not ti@@ ghten the competi@@ tor fight for affordable housing ? &quot;
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : true : we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but they were built in luxury apartments which hardly can afford more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , also the normal human beings need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the educ@@ ative mother or the righteous worship . &quot;
I am showing how to continue to be cheap and well supported today .
that is what it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system if Apple iPhone is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the control app , to &quot; gener@@ alities and then &quot; software update . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some are pushed after the installation on issues , since they get a error message that fails that the &quot; software update fails . &quot; &quot;
&quot; dealing with the problem , is recommended to users , either to wait until the rush is back or trying to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean the delet@@ ing of apps to make place - but Apple has made it more likely to do so , if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install it once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to make sure your mobile phone is loaded while up@@ loaded , or is located near a char@@ ger , so that the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not leave that the update will be continued since the phone could possibly be half way off and this could lead to a break@@ down of the updates . &quot;

&quot; for years , we have been firmly established with our out@@ patient care service , that often nursing homes are left alone . &quot;
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; nor rarely , many services of the masses are not used , because the complexity of the insur@@ ances could hardly be understood , &quot; explained the new land@@ lady in Jut@@ ta W@@ eig@@ and , which is solely responsible for Anton@@ isti@@ ft and citizen Hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Amadeus . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consultations there is the new cross @-@ office , but also prevention , health care and wellness . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into a boat . &quot;

the offers from the old @-@ centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis l@@ ends itself in an ideal way .

&quot; one of the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ ans , followed by the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called to them to wait for him . &quot;
at that point the group was at the height of the B@@ FT Gas station .
on the premises of the gas station there were also three people .
&quot; one of these men sh@@ ou@@ ted the young people , and hit this with the f@@ ist to the face . &quot;
the victim has suffered a nas@@ al @-@ gra@@ zing and ble@@ eding strongly from the nose .

&quot; there he was once again attacked by the bat , and another male person . &quot;
&quot; taking the aid of one stroke , we tested on the face and the th@@ igh@@ s of the victim . &quot;

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Fel@@ lowship ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take on the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel W@@ ir@@ ausen .
&quot; moreover , Sam@@ t@@ collaborative Artist Bernd Bor@@ mann , Economic Interest in Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country of doctors - As@@ endorf , there are luck : Dr. Frank Müller took over the practice of Fel@@ tre@@ ausen on October 1st . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Li@@ tre@@ ausen goes into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still putting his successor into the next few months with half a job . &quot;
&quot; after the construction of construction , Müller opens the practice again on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us road 6 . &quot;
&quot; it had compassion on the first look , when the Fel@@ lowship has met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently graduated in practice in at the same time as well as in practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage would be good in this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ tr@@ ausen and laugh@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; when it was , I was simply called it . &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to put its own practice in the future in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know the families about the years , and accompany them . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he will also be sure to be his own boss . &quot;
and so one was agreed that the tr@@ ash bought the house with the practice .
stay they are still living in breaking wood @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; there is the two @-@ fold family father Frank Müller also grown up in his medical studies in Hannover as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , N@@ ien@@ burg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently active as an officer in Sul@@ ingen , he also became director in 2009 as a leader in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in volunteers in the DRC @-@ readiness for Har@@ te @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; starting September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ oplast@@ y , his wife is working , his spouse ( boarding ) has specialized in gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the tr@@ ash , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle for themselves as a household . &quot;
&quot; the End@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
after the re@@ building the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ as@@ ound investigations as well as long @-@ term and load @-@ quality EK@@ GS and need an intercom . more .
furthermore the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
&quot; a grant of a total of 50@@ 000 Euro , the gar@@ bage cans within the framework of a funding programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the community ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the community ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; says Sam@@ t@@ Community deb@@ tor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; approximately 2000 patients come according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll as each quarter in the practice of Fel@@ tr@@ ausen , in the north @-@ German ordinary practice , it is about 500 . &quot;
in As@@ h there is yet another home office .
a positive out@@ effect of the practic@@ ality by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel P@@ ien@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
&quot; if no successor was found , they would have gone . &quot;
&quot; who visited the Müll@@ ers Expert Consult@@ ation , we also look forward to familiar faces : taking care of the seven medical journals and the cleansing from the field . &quot;
&quot; with their departure end in As@@ endorf an era , after all the medi@@ cs have been practiced for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , but rec@@ alls Ur@@ sel rocks @-@ smile . &quot;
a little whale @-@ sen@@ sed it after the long time already .
&quot; but we are still living in Hohen@@ moor and many patients will certainly still see , &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; your husband is compl@@ em@@ ented : &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; up to now , I have always been pressed ahead of garden work , now it could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the couple has two grand@@ sons and travels to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls also went to our Southern border , &quot; said Interior Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain equally well maintained .
&quot; still be clear that every one wants to put a asylum application , this can also be &quot; granted . &quot; &quot;
the care and security of the people at the front stand .
&quot; but it is clear that there are distinct signs , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
people have to know that we don &apos;t accept bound@@ less migration flows but also not on the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia
the Croatian government previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue to explore Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and Germany as well as Kor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; however , the Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see this . &quot;
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors be &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; but Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fy .
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; like the minister , Slovenia wants to find its limits to refugees but not Cal@@ abria . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; like the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday , to pass the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to do@@ dge the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could take them in the nearby cities of corn .
&quot; according to local media , since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik constantly pro@@ g the police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is primarily for Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
&quot; also , b@@ ail@@ out and the Red Cross are already in use . &quot;
&quot; in the coming days , his country will be rech@@ ar@@ ded by around 4,000 refugees , Minister of Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo , to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously launched migrants to the Hungarian border , followed Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but the Government in Belgrade ranks , however , that it may be that people want to take some routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reporting , at least in the morning there was a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived at the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , and in the course of the day other buses would be expected . &quot;
across Croatia - Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ mates were the whole night of the approximately 500 kilometres distant from the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary made it , so the police said we should leave here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it might actually become a forec@@ ast@@ ed shift of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west away . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s minister of O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for the case of a strong state of refugees .
&quot; he did not called he , but pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member had &quot; &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot; . &quot; &quot;
hal@@ ize strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of the European Union since 2007 , and is a good record of the country since the country is a positive testim@@ onial from the standard of the border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the side of the Hungarian border , there continues about 300 refugees behind the Hungarian border au@@ n . &quot;
&quot; according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reporting she would have spent the past night at the crossing of Hor@@ go , who runs out after R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
according to the Hungarian authorities the two border crossing Hor@@ ns and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees now wish to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
&quot; the Serbian Minister of N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stefan ano@@ vic tried to so@@ ak at a local market in Hor@@ go , while the Hungarian border is now closed , for breakfast . &quot;
it would not currently be very high for refugees .
&quot; we could not say whether they would continue their journey via Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers dis@@ ks migrants to - dangerous - altern@@ ate pipes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute the refugees on which alternative routes are marked through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are 20 years after the end of the Croatian background , there are still not vac@@ ated min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
on Wednesday evening the Croatian Police was announced that a team of min@@ de@@ ans was sent in the border region .

&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok shall have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminal , which has been thrown out since 2010 , has repeatedly provided insight into still un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ wi@@ red and PR News@@ wire . &quot;
the information should be taken into the financial markets with the exploited information .
&quot; in this way , the investig@@ ators were concluded a total of over 100 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our state borders will ultimately be tr@@ apped , &quot; it is stated in the SE@@ C notification . &quot;
the processes against 32 further accus@@ ations in the case took place .
most of the def@@ endants are from Ukraine and Georgia .

&quot; it is life , so we went to the midst of the action in the midst of the city and among people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the guides of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ aid is also available for pas@@ sers as well as questions and discussions as well as volunteers .
&quot; while some passages can lead spont@@ aneously to chal@@ k up and set the phrase &quot; &quot; my life be@@ j@@ ah@@ en , &quot; &quot; read &quot; &quot; with the camper from the USA , &quot; &quot; read the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not too long , read , read propositions as &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; and go on . &quot;
&quot; over and over again , at the edge of small discussions about the action itself , life , dealing with the dying . &quot;
Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is just on site .
&quot; only when I make clear that , for me , the end of this world comes , I can make a responsible &quot; , &quot; says the director of the de@@ mic Wer@@ kes Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ az@@ verband carriers of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ aid . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public cat@@ astrop@@ hic action to 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; however , that not everyone wants to communicate openly of the tables , but eventually it is understandable , eventually it is a very personal matter . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and dying is still aff@@ lic@@ ted with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the Hosp@@ iz@@ ers decisi@@ vely contributed a lot in recent years that the people open . &quot;
an assessment that divi@@ des the Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id .
the dying and super @-@ companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
&quot; through personal experience confronted with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; as the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ Aid was asked by calling for volunteers , she immediately reported and was here in the year 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id belongs to a team of 45 volunteer , 43 women and two men - the affected and members of private household , hospitals , nursing homes , and Hos@@ pi@@ z Sankt Vincent . &quot;
all of them are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id can be well done with her job and the experience and experience .
&quot; I see the life of another warning , consider it costly and este@@ emed the moment , &quot; says it . &quot;
the offer of an @-@ patient E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice service is free of charge and den@@ omin@@ ational .
the financial support of hospitals and donations of relatives and associations enable the training as well as training and super@@ visor of the dying and funeral crew .
every two years training for new employees are offered .
&quot; the tablets described on Saturday are now displayed in the house of the evangel@@ ical church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) . &quot;

Fed@@ Ex earnings joint , fin@@ ance prospects for 2016 &quot;
&quot; Fed@@ Ex reports reported results for the last quarter , and the delivery shows its profit to a whole year because of weaker demand for freight services and higher cost in his land transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that she is planning , at about 5@@ 5.000 labor@@ er workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to susp@@ end the 50,000 Seas@@ on@@ ers for the period of time . &quot;
the share fell over 2.5 per cent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; Fed@@ Ex Corp. predicted to earn a gain between 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 in the financial year that ends in the next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in the previous tum@@ ble . &quot;
an@@ al@@ ysts expected to survey participants in a survey of fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 . &quot;
&quot; despite the price increase , the average level will amount to the average of 4,@@ 9 percent and will be effective on January 4 , and despite greater fail@@ ures for soil transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November onwards . &quot;
&quot; the company said that , however , I expect the outcome on the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and due to growth in online trade . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company returns &quot; solid revenue , if you consider the weaker economic conditions , above all in manufacturing and global trade , into consideration . &quot;
&quot; the plans for a vacation rental have announced a day later than that of the Ri@@ val UPS , the planning is planning , 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5.000 additional labor , about the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than last year . &quot;
&quot; the earnings per share paid to € 88 $ per share , just behind the $ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research asked an@@ al@@ ysts . &quot;

six of these packs asked an@@ al@@ ysts 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
&quot; in recent years Fed@@ Ex has carried out a decline in its international primary content shipping , which presented its turnover in its unit Express shipping . &quot;
but the boom in online @-@ shopping has increased the results at Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent in the last quarter , but the operating result was mainly flat because of higher cost for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit recorded higher profits due to higher prices , while the result is decreased because of higher labour costs in the cargo business . &quot;
&quot; after@@ market trade , about an hour before opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares at 3,@@ 85 € , or 2.5 percent , on 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , she concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; on their most anticipated meeting in the years , Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ egen spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it is time for the first time since almost a decade to lift the benchmark . &quot;
&quot; dro@@ pping over them at an end of the reduced , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed seating area is located a m@@ ural of the United States . &quot;
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation to all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ ahead order of Congress : maxim@@ izing the U.S. employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is a rep@@ lic@@ ated third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; this third mandate would be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ di@@ ct them . it is announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by the close @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data from the economy show that it grows solid , the most recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed Represent@@ atives to increase this vol@@ ati@@ lity through the raising of interest rates for federal government - and be it just a fourth percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first instance will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lin@@ d@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief economically in the Mak@@ ler@@ firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for an excuse to not increase the interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market enough justi@@ fication , continues to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do what the F@@ ed itself has de@@ filed itself to the financial market .
&quot; about half of economics , which have been raised recently by Bloomberg , have forec@@ ast@@ ed this week . &quot;
&quot; financial markets are expecting a waiting for the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ an , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates to a decrease in the stock market , in case the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the Str@@ at@@ egen str@@ ates the strike and promise that a further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage worth around 21.@@ 28,@@ 89 points or about 1,@@ 4@@ 99@@ ,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed politics is continuing the sentence during this week , said John Lon@@ sky , Chief Executive Committee at Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the propositions at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does it , she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets , so that they do not panic into panic . &quot;
some experts argue that a fork @-@ cave would calm the financial markets because they will take uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed sh@@ ed on good way to increase the set around 0.25 percent@@ ages in this month , the first little step in a slow tight@@ ening of the mon@@ ary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; criminal had said in spring and early summer , despite the complaints from Liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the proposition . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August demanded , the improvement in the labour market was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate s@@ ank on 5.5 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage investigations have shown signs of a recovery .
&quot; and although inflation went constantly under the end target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief ö@@ kon@@ om at Pan@@ theon Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; on the end of last month , financial markets gathered around the world at the end of the last month after China had de@@ valued its currency . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage worth more than 16 % below its peak , as investors feared that a slow@@ ing of Chinese economies would increase global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered in this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now up by nearly 10 % under the high end of May . &quot;
for the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives influence market uph@@ e@@ av@@ al the complex calculation when you have interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not appeared during the past few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fellow at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the U.S. &quot;
he predicted that they will wait at least a month to get the impact better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in its decision making . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed Monetary authorities has become the world of the world .
the impact of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere indication of that time , Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could be their mon@@ eti@@ ary expansion &quot; &quot; tight &quot; , &quot; cleared turbul@@ ent all around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives are expected to monitor the developments at another place , but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; your decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Car@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for asset management of the company En@@ lar@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noticed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to financial market movements that have apparently not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; acker , the justified member of the Federal Open Market Committee , acting for a fork series , based decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to cut its benchmark to around 0,75 percent@@ ages in three sessions &quot; despite limited perc@@ ussions for growth in the U.S. , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives were revers@@ ed this cuts .
&quot; F@@ ed should put into the first place aspects of financial stability as a result of a severe economic crisis in 2008 , Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the committee for interest to interest the Bank of England . &quot;
the most recent tur@@ mo@@ il do not come close to this plane .
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation where they are afraid of a fork @-@ cave , because the markets grew up , &quot; said P@@ ants , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act contains still the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t believe it should be the time hur@@ ry . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
a warm welcome to prepare you will not work without the commitment of a volunteer don@@ or .
&quot; also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are quite a lot of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city . &quot;
among them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
also with her 74 L@@ enzen she is still teaching .
every Thursday she is doing in the asylum seeker at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
&quot; she helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is quite different in teaching than at the right school . &quot;
Brazilian Society Rio Grande promotes diet for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric Organization SP@@ RS is trying to educate women on sho@@ cking how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of images of babies which su@@ ck up with portr@@ ay@@ als of un@@ healthy food painted .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that babies give up all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers , have got their daily cal@@ orie intake about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie adaptation is not the only di@@ ä@@ te@@ tic adaptation that the mothers should make . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy eating pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protect them from the development of tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ hall
the Council of Bern@@ ried permitted the application for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be made for solar gear .
&quot; the planning for the long @-@ out engine rever@@ ber@@ cul@@ ation at Bern@@ rie@@ der sport grounds come step by step : in the recent meeting session , the working order has been signed without major discussions . &quot;
&quot; previously , the Panel had decided , among other things , a request for a &quot; legal &quot; exception &quot; &quot; from valid construction plan . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; exception &quot; it was the permission for a special form concerning the construction construction . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; saddle @-@ roof &quot; &quot; is set to be built with non @-@ qualified first and roof tile . &quot;
&quot; the backdrop for planning is the intended use of the roof for solar power plants : &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern part , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; deli@@ ver@@ ance &quot; , &quot; it was in turn around the roof @-@ incl@@ ination , which is for energy reasons - unlike in the construction plan for it - below ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; deli@@ ver@@ ance &quot; was therefore necessary because the construction plan for the umbrella is not &quot; &quot; permitted , &quot; &quot; whereby the am@@ using of the council usually goes more restric@@ tive in terms of support . &quot;
&quot; however , in rever@@ ber@@ ation , it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a Prec@@ ision &quot; , &quot; so St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the turn@@ rever@@ ber@@ ation at the sports centre is a joint project of the community and SV Bern@@ ried .
costs are around 2.3 million euros per year .
subsidies are expected from school and gr@@ ass@@ roots promotion .
&quot; in the next step process the construction contract is presented for the 18 x 36 meters in hall now the governor , for the test . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is said to be closed before as planned - namely 2016 .
simultaneously Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new doctor of doctors at the hospital in Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station as well as the majority of associates move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg with to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this is seeing the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the Land of the Country , the land@@ lady Andrea Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ Weiß confirmed . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on the course of the Supervisory Board , though the Supervisory Board , and the t@@ ch@@ ased on the next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans are to be implemented , all of which nearly 50 employees would continue in the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority was to pull together with fishermen and the farther @-@ existing interior Station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the staff that cannot be offered with after Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered in Wei@@ l@@ heim an workplace , so Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
the employees are informed about their plans .
&quot; the change has triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been Managing Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in immediate vicinity of the hospital . &quot;
&quot; in the question who follows the succession , Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who declared to take on the direction of 1 October and to change the direction of his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au pre@@ tends this in every case a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the range in the field &quot; internal medicine , &quot; so Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist of heart @-@ based and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the inner station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic disorders .
&quot; in part for the next two years , fishermen are to provide fishermen with his team , if the Supervisory Board will serve to serve both houses , until then next year the former Hospital of Kn@@ app@@ rais@@ al , which has still been closed for over 35 years , in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years to be finally closed . &quot;
&quot; so far , the county councils has been planned for 2018 if the current refurb@@ ishment has been completed by the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital . &quot;
&quot; betra@@ y@@ al Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White , who is also chairman of the board of directors , ru@@ mor the establishment of the house , which is owned by the Federal Constitutional Council , to be used as an accommodation for asylum @-@ fever . &quot;
&quot; I slept with the property . as it goes with the property , Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White could not say , there are several refl@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; at present , there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a local psychiat@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; what Bes@@ ky@@ es could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; says Fischer about the Qu@@ asi rel@@ ocation to the Le@@ ch , who had been positive and very comprehen@@ sible by the employees &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , which has been working to fishermen for over 30 years as Chief Executive Officer , &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened with closing in recent decades , departments were concluded , for example the surgery and Obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the handful of of the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are demanded today evening ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) at the Berg@@ ische HC .
&quot; the leader of the Bundes@@ liga is in Wuppertal , namely the clear favorite , cause for adul@@ tery . &quot;

during the Aber@@ nt@@ ens on a Ma@@ is@@ feld near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ marks Witt@@ enberg ) there were several be@@ aters in action as the police rus@@ hed .
after a stop@@ over there was a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man serious injuries and were brought into hospitals .
&quot; how exactly it could come to the accident , was not complete . &quot;
the Cri@@ cid police is determined .
miss 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate victims of violence
a crime suspic@@ ious has led the police on the mor@@ gue of the since Saturday 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate .
&quot; in the court of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , the young people were killed and their cor@@ pse was thrown into a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; one since Saturday , 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate is a violent crime to the victim . &quot;
&quot; the funeral of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen among Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as he prosec@@ utor and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; likewise , as a tat@@ able one also applies to the Tuesday evening 20 @-@ year @-@ old , which indeed led to the specification and investig@@ ators led to the place of discovery of the body . &quot;
&quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had already been reported on Sunday morning , after the evening after a visit to the autumn day in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen were not as agreed upon it . &quot;
&quot; when searching for the young woman , the investig@@ ator first came to personal objects of the victim . &quot;
in surveys in the friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the mis@@ understood was finally a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the old @-@ scale perpet@@ r@@ ator led the police to a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ pse was found .
&quot; according to the police officers , the authorities were killed in the police officers , killed 16 @-@ year @-@ old and laid out the cor@@ pse in the channel . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be pre@@ ached at the Wednesday of the Haf@@ sl@@ inger , the investig@@ ators lay its tot@@ ality to the burden . &quot;
decision on the closer circumstances of the act should bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodations : study war@@ ns in front of apartment
the location on the German housing market is tense .
more and more refugees are looking for payable amount .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing building stands in front of a challenge .
the distribution of distribution on the German market @-@ market has long since begun .
&quot; with the emerging refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ bur@@ dened in many big cities . &quot;
it will compete with in@@ comes citizens about the most recent @-@ paid apartments .
&quot; to cover the demand for affordable housing , would have to be built over 400,000 new units by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; at this end , a study on behalf of the association &apos;s contribution of &quot; Social supplies . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this year in Germany 26@@ 0,000 units are finished . &quot;
&quot; therefore , 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
refugees were no longer obliged to live in an initial accommodation after the first three months of their stay .
&quot; many of them come across the apartment market , st@@ alls in the long sn@@ akes in front of the apartments . &quot;
&quot; according to statistics , in the last year , less than half of all the asylum seek@@ ers were to rent . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market lie not only to the rising wave of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes considerable fail@@ ures in the housing field of recent years .
&quot; Germany has an apartment deficit in front of her , which is bigger from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently , in the metropol@@ itan areas already has some 77@@ 0,000 dwelling units , lam@@ ents Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many care@@ ers therefore inhabited in big cities and penet@@ rated into WG rooms .
young adults remained un@@ voluntary over the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the built @-@ in in the housing market .
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita in recent years has dropped again . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social supplies &quot; proposes a rest@@ art . &quot;
here new incentives for social housing construction should boost social housing again .
&quot; in such a way , it could be disp@@ ers@@ ed on the Gr@@ under@@ statement tax and the property tax for shaped apartments will be suspended . &quot;
&quot; moreover , according to alliance attractive tax @-@ control options are needed . &quot;
the funding programmes for refugee @-@ arri@@ es of the State Bank K@@ f@@ W is already well known in towns and villages .
&quot; a good week after the start was closed on Monday evening , with 184 million euros more than half of the amount paid by some 300 million euros . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be increased . &quot;
refugees have a free impact : Croatia and Slovenia to cor@@ ridor
&quot; Hungary is practically no longer tran@@ sit@@ ed , as you choose more and more refugees crossing the road to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb An@@ no@@ un@@ ces the transit on Slovenia to North without hur@@ dles .
but the route is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to engage in Slovenia with neighbouring Slovenia to set up a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked to the Sloven@@ ian internal affairs , and if it is necessary we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already one of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU @-@ country Croatia is not yet a Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; after the sealing of the Serbian Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees went to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television station RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary had sail@@ ed its border for refugees on the day before .
&quot; new laws that occurred the same day in force , make clear asylum procedures in Hungary virtually super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic , said : &quot; You can go through and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
but there are people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had picked up the first refugees on the border of Serbia on the border to Serbia in Croatia .
&quot; most of the people came to report , according to Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border city of Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , she had tried to walk on the green border to Croatia . &quot;
the refugees arrive at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border with refugees in the Croatian border .
&quot; but the border extends to other dangers , there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
Min@@ en@@ spatial should now gain a safe passage .
&quot; after Hungary , after the closing of the border any more refugees arrive . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police listed 36@@ 6 set @-@ up people . &quot;
&quot; shortly before the closure on Monday , it had been 9@@ 380 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws are to take the overthrow and dam@@ aging the Grenz@@ za@@ uns as a crime .
in the southern Hungarian border Sz@@ eged will therefore be introduced in 35 criminal proceedings .
condemned and deport@@ ations from the country up to five years and exp@@ ul@@ sion from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority on Tuesday , there was a total of 94 Asy@@ a entries on Tuesday , of which nearly all - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there were 40 refugees left there .
but virtually no one has a view to get asylum in Hungary .
&quot; in the same view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot; &quot;
the ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers are to be de@@ ported .
in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there were only a few hundred refugees .
&quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to break down . &quot;
they gathered the gar@@ bage to leave the tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in recent weeks .
pl@@ ywood have been completed and one of the reception camp in the bor@@ derland was rebuilt .
for the purpose of this construction nobody wanted to express itself .
Austria will reach only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 migrants , only in the country , they stopped in the country . &quot;
around 1400 people in Salzburg are waiting for the return to Germany .
traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on directive of German authorities .
in free@@ zing we regularly met smaller groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor of the mess@@ enger &quot; took over the border
&quot; we were engaged after the bridge on Sunday with the dre@@ aming , when suddenly ten people were standing with motor@@ homes at the entrance of the tent , &quot; so W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alois City . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted by train to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; because Germany had set off on Sunday because of the refugee stream of railway with Austria , it was immediately surprising to them in W@@ ern@@ stein , which immediately offered its help and ch@@ att@@ ed the ges@@ tr@@ ash along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Pass@@ au River . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we did not hop@@ ed the un@@ reasonable guests with j@@ acks and beverages . &quot;
&quot; we said the same , we take them by car to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; said coun@@ ters in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let him pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for fire bri@@ g@@ ades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this has been very happy , &quot; &quot; so for@@ kli@@ fts . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening in Wels of a ICE train in Wels by one ICE in a regional train in the direction of Pass@@ au , it was cancelled after the short notice , that the railway traffic to Germany was dis@@ continued , but still trying to cross the border . &quot;
&quot; the regional train , however , was placed in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn . &quot;
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross @-@ border generally is high in the course .
the Br@@ ücken@@ fest together with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday closed a two @-@ step wiz@@ ard - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen !
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent further tw@@ ins to us , is a logical result of a cri@@ holy policy : &quot;
&quot; rather than in stock R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in the establishment of structures to help humanity , our Federal Chancellor has officially recognised the Federal Government in the dun@@ ce of National Socialism . &quot;
Lei@@ d@@ trag@@ eous this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now facing in the bor@@ derland with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; the refugees must also find that the &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will become a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee streams and of the nearby winter , with us to establish decent states for prot@@ ectors . &quot;
&quot; and there will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
Konrad in search of 35.@@ 000 winter@@ ing Quar@@ ry
Konrad has kept all hands full of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to find that his word has weight .
the government has used the earlier large Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ ban@@ ker to initi@@ ate Lod@@ g@@ ings for thousands of refugees .
&quot; when the chaos at the first @-@ party Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , Konrad has already got a grip on . &quot;
&quot; we have no homeless hospitality in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday to take place without great work , Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the ministry spoke of a &quot; mur@@ ky situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , Konrad faced with a need of 8@@ 5,000 quar@@ ks in the he@@ ur@@ inary year . &quot;
&quot; to meet the number , will have to be found in the next weeks more than 3@@ 5,000 accommodations - 20,000 should provide countries to 15,000 people . &quot;
if there are more refugees we can do it .
&quot; but there is no barrel without ground , &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already made talks with the state of directors .
they would have promised him also for the coming refugees to be lod@@ g@@ ings .
&quot; in Ober@@ österreich it works well , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot;
the former VP Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Car@@ dinal Christoph Schön@@ born , in doing it shall be silent as the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; great expectations put the asylum @-@ ordinator also into the OR@@ F action , &quot; &quot; Help &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the platform can offer private people and accomodation .
&quot; in addition , one hopes to see hotels , which in winter will be empty . &quot;
Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for the accommodation as a &quot; very high . &quot;
&quot; in Not@@ ice , it might not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ors must have to keep a certain amount of hand @-@ holder or size of the upper @-@ light . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; Emer@@ gency &quot; &quot; should be valid . &quot;
&quot; that he was more successful in the opposition to the owner of the accommodation , Konrad and his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentl@@ eman , which you cannot without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause the Republic to explain how they themselves explained .
their number of employees want to increase their number from three to four .
my own arti@@ san@@ ity party has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to establish a container at Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
&quot; however , there are apparently problems with the permit . &quot;
Linz demands better distribution
&quot; before , no opening of city Spor@@ th@@ all and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and design center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , this is not necessary since one could present those measures without these measures , said Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
for the emergen@@ cies further sites will be tested for their divers .
critic@@ isms of the city &apos;s responsibilities to the division of refugees within the state of the country .
other areas must contribute their contribution here .
&quot; Se@@ ah@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders will not be sealed &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone call with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) ( VP ) on Monday the further procedure in the refugee question is established .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer assured me that the German border cannot be sealed .
the disclosure of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
but it is now just that the limits of the border controls now .
special co@@ atings from refugees to Germany will not give it any more .
but the protection of the prosp@@ ectors would have brought with regular moves to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ it@@ inger once called for greater solidarity in the refugee question . &quot;
&quot; that now Austria has also stepped onto the border controls for Austria , a logical consequence &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a matter of time
the General fin@@ er of the &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industry line has been officially concluded .
&quot; four of the six floors of office and production building is the listed company group S &amp; T established , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area . &quot;
&quot; in the IT , the clever heads our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Dut@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he can imagine to invest in start@@ up companies in the New ship@@ yard and later on which to compete .
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - in which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some : &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.9 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T into the site , 3.3 million euros of the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is rated from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters in the building are rented , for another 40 percent I will give requests . &quot;

large bags and accessories are cost up to 500 Euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
&quot; previously , several weeks has been altered . &quot;
&quot; but I have overcome many things for a long time , whether I still want to open a shop , &quot; says broad . &quot;
&quot; decisive for the decision was among other things , that also the Fur@@ la producers who are in Bologna at home , from the idea of a private site , where only their hand@@ bags be sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the Only in the Greater Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot;
your fashion interest has placed wide from her mother into the cradle .
I emerged most when something develops and I can show new trends at high prices .
&quot; why so some woman is talking to a beautiful pur@@ se in tin , can also answer the expert wife not with last safety . &quot;
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag records each out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; the P@@ c@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from one place , whose inhabitants are called for . &quot;
&quot; this property also connects to the billi@@ on@@ aire , the U.S. president . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for Set @-@ off .
whether it is expressed by xen@@ opho@@ bic Pro@@ verb@@ s to journalists or about tri@@ mos@@ quit@@ oes in international crisis policy - the candidate for the presidential guard comp@@ lies the election campaign .
and cuts well up .
&quot; this is also registered at the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ isches K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grandparents were taken up of the real @-@ billi@@ on@@ aires . &quot;
the New Yorker with the barrel @-@ hair@@ style is a concept many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road .
man@@ holes in the 1200 @-@ citizen village is related to it related to it .
&quot; his grand@@ si@@ re came from K@@ all@@ stadt in Palat@@ ine : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the election mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ t Simone Wen@@ del filmed a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do vill@@ agers on his aim to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that is somehow fascinating , but are not so deeply impressed in their cal@@ m@@ stad@@ ters , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
the native sh@@ all@@ est film has a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous jumps loop , to which among Tru@@ mp also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mod@@ est@@ y , comes to &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too , as with the statement that he would certainly also be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
for the king of the heart he has not put it there .
&quot; though , there was respect for the performance of the family , but also tends the opinion that Tru@@ mp is already a bit &apos; l@@ ish &apos; , says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; by chance of the top name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the radius , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - become High @-@ German : the Inn@@ es , says it . &quot;
tru@@ mp comes from the village of the in@@ ad@@ vices .
&quot; the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began 1885 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened in the United States a restaurant for the min@@ er tom@@ bs . &quot;
found@@ ational of the real estate company were first property sales in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grandparents was not free from wearing : their desire to return to the home , failed in the Bav@@ arian state , which was then belonged to the Palatinate at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp because he was once without permission , had the Director of the Institute of pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ic History and Economics , Roland Paul , who explains the film start . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
it is in contrast to the mit@@ es of the descendants .
&quot; he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States , and called for the construction of a border wall to deter@@ red some illegal immigrants . &quot;
&quot; just as the pol@@ tert , is not that sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote @-@ name Tru@@ mp@@ s ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the Op@@ a was born @-@ born &quot; ) . &quot;
win@@ em@@ akers in retirement sees the Americans rather stand@@ off@@ ish but he is always so up@@ burning .
does he believes that Tru@@ mp comes ?
&quot; this cannot imagine it , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Pen@@ sion@@ al Sch@@ ramm is mentioned as man@@ holes K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz with a visit to the church &apos;s church , what was generally well on . &quot;
&quot; this can I do not imagine of Donald &apos;s , &quot; says the 68 year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they pret@@ end better if he doesn &apos;t win the choice , for &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had been doing the days at the time of his grandfather in the USA , would have been like him , &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics like him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not it , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ri@@ pe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot;

&quot; Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son went to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report after the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but it has no major shifting to the reviews of today . &quot;
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was scre@@ ened by the German capital as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .

&quot; this down@@ side of the board seemed to play no part for the Australian TV audience , since Sun@@ rise was an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 spect@@ ators in the five main towns , compared to the today today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today an easy increase in opposite of ratings to Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and the last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today in the last few months today there has been closed a gap to Sun@@ rise .
&quot; in August today , today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 3@@ 30.000 by Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year the gap between 4@@ 0,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; so far in September Sun@@ rise stands at an average of 34@@ 9.@@ 000 spect@@ ators to 3@@ 14.@@ 000 at today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happened every morning .

the big ren@@ cy for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star from Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ter Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama over a recently established father , which closes with his two children at the New Zealand of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spect@@ ators . &quot;
critics were asked if Thom@@ son hit a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ter Star Rebecca Geb@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; YES . &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed strongly with 1.9 million spect@@ ators and suggested easily The Block ( 8@@ 38.@@ 000 ) and T@@ B@@ L Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17h30 ) of the new tri@@ via show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe , followed by the average of 44@@ 6.000 spect@@ ators . &quot;
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) sp@@ rang up to 6@@ 23,@@ 000 spect@@ ators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ seat ( 6@@ 13.@@ 000 ) .
&quot; on Monday night the first half hour was achieved by The Ch@@ ase Australia 5@@ 20,000 audience and in the second half hour &apos;s No. 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;

&quot; the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ? &quot;
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; Lana Je@@ av@@ os Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have kno@@ w@@ ingly kno@@ w@@ ingly , who The Bachelor wins . &quot;
&quot; the woman , who finally arrived at Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was wrapped in biggest confidentiality . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ os Fel@@ lows in the day before coming out of three , you may at acci@@ dentally give an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood continues his lips by the final on Thursday sealed .
&quot; all three women have looked at a ly@@ rical way of why wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons for why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you who should be put into the last rose ? , &quot; could their answers to the game sp@@ oil , who won the heart of the brook . &quot;
&quot; Je@@ av@@ os Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki , both sc@@ anned - besides yourself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood . &quot;
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day on .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and notice ( Sar@@ &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies noticed that they were quite compatible and I &apos;ve thought the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ os Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands with both feet on the earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; she added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the correct chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be good as a pair .
&quot; M@@ ack@@ ay said from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house@@ wife last week made her clear that wood &quot; &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and my family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ folding on him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked whom Wood was supposed to , if not she , there she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I do not know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a Draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
&quot; the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 PM . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest following his move to the USA - and there were many other teams that were sent to en@@ quiries after its impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco Bay and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
&quot; some coaches would have Hay@@ es for the rest of the game to the bank , when he lost a sp@@ angel so , as it was the Aussie @-@ Rug@@ by League con@@ verti@@ bility to his first P@@ unt @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota . &quot;
but Tom@@ o@@ ula intimate his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to give a p@@ unt tour and also to the current game based on a breach of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to prove his real face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; rather than ro@@ aming his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula took Hay@@ es publicly available at his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ es has also been encouraged by specialty teams @-@ coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who ri@@ ke him to forget his buried f@@ ang and to take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t with a P@@ unt which was restored in the first game quarter by the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings .
&quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive austr@@ alian tr@@ ailers for his N@@ FL @-@ debut . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ ne left the playing field for the F@@ um@@ ble flu@@ ent the playing field , and later told the Australian radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a bad start in his N@@ FL career , &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game and that &apos;s it , &quot; says Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne st@@ ains the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a pass carried out in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area on a Tr@@ y for Queensland .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

&quot; the free voters demand because of the high refugee numbers , the setting of 1000 new doctors in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ autumn , Hubert Ai@@ di@@ anger became a serious crisis at Bay@@ erns : at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ autumn season , if there are not a new teacher for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1,000 additional teachers to keep the schools before the collapse , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get obj@@ ections in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot;
the comp@@ elling campaign of the free elect@@ ors will be held until Friday in the ro@@ gue of the Comm@@ une .
&quot; actually , very different main themes were provided . &quot;
but the record @-@ number of refugees also domin@@ ates the free elect@@ or@@ ate meeting .
&quot; of course , the topic of asylum will conf@@ use the cl@@ ut@@ ants , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ v@@ anger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as they were during the 1990 wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; so we do not go further , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free voters . &quot;
final asylum seek@@ ers want to shift the Free voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; that &apos;s why Ai@@ w@@ anger also called for more staff for the administrative meals which are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum @-@ readers , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ W head criti@@ ci@@ zed that several states are not consistently pursued : &quot; &quot; we have been uniform nation@@ wide standards of the Länder . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria shifts , others not . &quot;
&quot; there , we need to become more able . &quot;
&quot; however , the provincial government should not fall into the table under the table . &quot;
a ran@@ ger per@@ bur@@ ner remains on the agenda : the policy of policy .
&quot; for the new school year , K@@ ult@@ us@@ minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) received the pilot piece &quot; intermediate stage plus &quot; in which an extension of the gymn@@ asi@@ an intermediate stage is tested by three to four years - in the result it takes nine years to completion . &quot;
however this goes not far enough .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all the gymn@@ asi@@ ums that want to do this .
&quot; free drive at G@@ 9 everywhere , where it is desired . &quot;

&quot; according to &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; missing the German energy consumers possibly have 30 billion euros to re@@ orientation . &quot;
the Federal Government denied the numbers mentioned in the press .
&quot; as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy consumers grew up somewhat , but ultimately lost ( RW@@ E ) and 6.6 percent ( eon ) . &quot;

&quot; in this case , investments should be paid in the total range of W@@ af@@ er technologies and the focus on the market . &quot;
&quot; Auto@@ values were asked : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August , more cars were ab@@ alled than in the pre @-@ year period , like the industry association Ac@@ ea to the start of the International Motor Show I@@ AA in Frankfurt . &quot;

4 people killed ; after police officers went to shoot at the demonstr@@ ator &apos;s demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police officers went in a crowds that were demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , leading District Apostles , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , with some of you stones and fi@@ bom@@ bs . &quot;
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police have used mani@@ fold and then fin@@ s into the air before applying to rubber .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were wounded , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber com@@ rade , known from which they can indeed be used but traditionally used as a lesser mor@@ tal alternative , evi@@ dently a so high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the discussion was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nep@@ al@@ ese , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ adh@@ esi say that new provinces that are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus which have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , among them 11 police officers , have been in violent conflicts since the 10 . &quot;
&quot; in August killed , when the four large political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which was centrally governed by centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator exp@@ elled the process after the devast@@ ating earthqu@@ akes that had killed in April thousands of people . &quot;
&quot; leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the Constitutional Court , and officials would say that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction site planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is designed to be built again .

Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market some 4,000 square meter land in direct vicinity to the youth centre Alte Post .
preparations are running for this moment .
&quot; the site is planned to use the grounds for a mixture of trade , commercial and living . &quot;

&quot; under the pressure of the project criticism and the F@@ DP group that pre@@ aching the investors and the administration of intelligence , Ralf B@@ ehr@@ ends from the System @-@ Bau we put into the offensive : &quot; we have not yet responded to all questions . &quot; &quot; he said before the members of the members and over 50 visitors . &quot;
&quot; however , it is good to be able to encounter all ru@@ mo@@ urs now . &quot;
the project has been in discussion about ten to twelve million euros for months .
&quot; fier@@ ce reactions among the sea @-@ classes , who came into the meeting , called the pictures and new details on the desired hotel structure . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ bu@@ owners and executive member in the Association of Inter@@ lieg@@ er , Pro H@@ ieve , lam@@ ents : &quot; this becomes a giant cl@@ ot@@ z who over@@ tops all the other past@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he fears like several other project criticism that the traffic through the intended size of the plant would increase greatly : &quot; &quot; there have to be whole bus st@@ unts , so that he does not anticip@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; what happens to the good one hect@@ are of the former host of the guest house is still open , but it is still open . &quot;
still there is no operator .
&quot; only then we must have a conclusi@@ ve concept of &quot; , &quot; said Ralf B@@ ehr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this was still lacking , the construction plans are still variable . &quot;

&quot; on our trip were many dark train and bus trips , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are des@@ per@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; the donations are going to four non @-@ governmental organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Google said that the first global donations collected up to $ 5,@@ 5 million in googl@@ e.@@ com. &quot;

for slightly overweight di@@ abe@@ tics can be weight@@ ed surgery helpful .
the benefits of weight@@ ing surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for a new study at least five years .
&quot; it is still too early to say , whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after the weight loss may longer live than those who do not get @-@ surgical treatments . &quot;
&quot; the mortality rate need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss surgery , that wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ ama Sur@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to shr@@ ink the size of stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absor@@ b food .
&quot; over the years in obesity the treatment of type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes are proven to be efficient , but most studies were carried out in people that are fat fat fat , with an Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain level of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that somebody is overweight and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ gov / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data which have collected them since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those who under@@ went this operation , ank from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained at the one who did not have surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who subjected to a surgical procedure , dropped off at 36 % the diabetes disease completely and at 28 % . &quot;
&quot; in medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , the diabetes treated completely only at one percent and partially at only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results in controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; found the authors out . &quot;
the researchers also monitoring the patient @-@ blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which refl@@ ecting the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent and write the researchers .
&quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by about 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the medical treatment group it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - like you reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - decreased not the mortality in five years , so the leading researchers Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also honoured the average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.8 kg ) , achieved greater back@@ rests in BM@@ I ( 7.3 % vs. 2.1 % ) and here@@ with more a complete overthrow of the Diabetes ( 46,@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival advantage of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden , that intervention goes to a longer life , says Black@@ stone of the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was high @-@ fat reduction in obesity , which was educated about 29 per cent less likely in the course of 15 years compared to a group that conven@@ tionally conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone , there is so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we have too long waiting until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they accum@@ ulate these genetic changes that have strongly linked their body with obesity and diabetes , is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot;
love @-@ story play in H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
&quot; it is an issue that is being studied in fiction in fiction : a young woman , she is un@@ popular and un@@ sight@@ ly , after years the flock of her youth is coming again and he fell in love with them . &quot;
thus also in the recent novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Luisa Bin@@ der .
&quot; beyond the love history , the novel might be interesting for H@@ uns@@ hi@@ er reader , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;

&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot record all refugees , &quot; &quot; the Dalai Lama explains and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis rise in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leader invites to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
&quot; the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of en@@ during refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visits in the United Kingdom , in his speech , at the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford , which deals with ethics studies . &quot;
he called that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; despite the Dalai Lama Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he said that there was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to worry about thousands of refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for this Muslim countries &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we must think about how killing in their countries is reduced . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of force never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented on George Bus@@ hs action after the terrorist attack from September 11 , presenting out that the violent response from the US has drawn a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after 11 September , I had expressed my compassion in a letter to President Bush and I said to him , the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence one and this has brought out unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ time increase of intake of dealer inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the past 4 years
&quot; in the US we report about an almost 400 % increase in the number of children under 12 years , which swal@@ low the alcoholic wr@@ ist san@@ iti@@ zer , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Centre . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , raise the cases of revenues of manual inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , the tox@@ ins centres , from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them enter in the note , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
videos on YouTube show how young people inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
adolescents are supposed to have dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant using alcohol @-@ temper@@ ing m@@ outh@@ wash to get a tough@@ er drink .
younger children can be engra@@ ved from attractive sc@@ ents of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are par@@ ked .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and or@@ anges , which are very appealing to children . &quot;
san@@ iti@@ zer means somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in small children can already use a few spra@@ yers to the alco@@ hol@@ tion .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ aries Centre at the University of K@@ ansas , the Sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not let sip whis@@ ky on but people leave these hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants within reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year girl , having recently taken four sp@@ lash of straw@@ berry smell from the dealer &apos;s san@@ iti@@ zer at school , was brought into an emergency treatment . &quot;
&quot; her blood @-@ alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally required in an adult than drunk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ est her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency .
&quot; doctors made them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen through alcohol and met her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; this was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; said Or@@ chi@@ ia Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ inf@@ ants and san@@ iti@@ zer outside the reach of the child .
about alcohol det@@ ox@@ i@@ fication were a few dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant associated with deaths .
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after the s@@ ells of slopes , inf@@ ect@@ ants that ab@@ used a toxic , not de@@ filed ingredient . &quot;
&quot; employees of health authorities susp@@ ect that the product meth@@ anol mis@@ hes , a deadly solution , instead of eth@@ yl@@ al co@@ hol , who was noted as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January the three students of the fourth category in the State of New York , were able to conc@@ ede their &quot; &quot; teachers &quot; , &quot; leaving anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , leaving it a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to san@@ iti@@ zer and ex@@ iles they form from their room .
&quot; the police considered the alleged plan as &quot; &quot; action tz &quot; &quot; and in@@ estim@@ ary actions on the subject authority . &quot;

it is because the stran@@ gers are not there .

you speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
&quot; there are a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it is not just the people of Scotland who want to see those games . &quot;

why I witness a maturity in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; somewhat later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see what a man has to be put to death . &quot;

he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses even at his death .
&quot; the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day was closer , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to share the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists visits to the USA and since often more applicants are available as places available , a mak@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery can take place in order to decide which is chosen . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media courts from 12 to five .
&quot; who is chosen , who will watch it emotional . &quot;

a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot;
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prison@@ er like he wants it and you get access .
I described myself with her .
&quot; you were dre@@ amed that she could have better form@@ ulate , but she is still thinking that it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ s@@ ard had problems with some of the things I said and posted .
&quot; he does not tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it , even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants that an international re@@ por@@ ter is present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement is help against death penalty . &quot;
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ viewer of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be sitting next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the event , please hear the series of Pod@@ casts I have done . &quot;
I will not go back to all details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ s@@ ult is inno@@ cent .
his actions after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty to be a benefici@@ ary of fact .
yet I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of the murder .
I believe that there is no enough evidence to justify a death item .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
&quot; and from that perspective , I will see him dying . &quot;
I can not claim to be really objective .
&quot; there will be other re@@ por@@ ters , in which you can turn to this . &quot;
&quot; what you will get from me is , what it is said to see a man ought to die an unnecessary death . &quot;
man after mo@@ ist police @-@ persec@@ ut@@ ters are persu@@ aded to come from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he sp@@ ake the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt of a man of Per@@ th to hang the police were un@@ successful when he found himself in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters from a police officer , trying to over@@ talk him gently to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a domestic peac@@ ef@@ al incident in B@@ ecken@@ ham .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ects , then he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I am not coming , come and see me , &quot; he said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ l@@ ed@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited to make his Uni@@ form ass , so he turned a reliable tactics - &apos; A good polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; he said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ l@@ ed@@ ine . &quot;
master@@ y @-@ soccer player Ben Cous@@ in offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , Cous@@ in his car was driving in the dit@@ ch to det@@ ach a alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben Cous@@ in Bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moody &apos;s asser@@ ted that ste@@ wards tried to leave him and threat@@ ens the racing sport .
&quot; Peter Moody &apos;s asser@@ ted that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables last year , and thre@@ aten the race immediately . &quot;
&quot; he quoted on the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the final st@@ roh@@ n on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moody &apos;s Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tries to do what is best for racing sport and he found himself under difficult conditions , when it comes to the positive Kob@@ alt @-@ Tup@@ fer@@ ing at Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain . &quot;
he had ref@@ ra@@ ined in 18 months due to the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age sp@@ ri@@ fe and didn &apos;t want to see it . I see how much hanging types of grapes .
&quot; I had before nothing to say about it , and I &apos;ve been eating long on it , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything gets out at once , &quot; said Moody . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with it what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to go into it my head , and I want my owners think that I try my best to try them . &quot;
&quot; when they begin to think , I do not do so , then I should not be a trainer . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moody &apos;s have had the Bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that had tried the integrity department , trying to sp@@ y his stable . &quot;
&quot; before eight@@ een months , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart in a room with a man - whom I will be asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables , to give information about what I do within my st@@ alls , &quot; said Moody on rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they obviously believe that I am a che@@ at .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they are trying to grip myself . &quot;
&quot; Robert Roul@@ ston , called . Chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ y , official President of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , current CEO of the RV@@ L , were aware of this time and still are today . &quot;
should it make me feel that it is personally ?
&quot; follow Route L &quot; &quot; is self @-@ evident and maybe people outside of trainers is responsible for what in the industry do ? &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so badly for the industry ?
perhaps people out there that I am .
&quot; perhaps they have to take my license and stum@@ ble me , and I have no doubt that what I say to think about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point where I do it , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on it and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the fru@@ stration levels of the trainer have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led him that he could throw his license on the table . &quot;
&quot; Moody , best known for his preparation of the un@@ scre@@ ened master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , marked the race @-@ day treatment rule , &quot; after a package of mud or sound had been applied to the horse , what the rules bl@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of race . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has mist@@ aken mud on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been so yesterday the whole day so what was the way .
it was also so on the race day .
Moody could face a three @-@ month discount for treatment with the pack at the race day . an examination of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who impose these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules but here you go too far , &quot; said Moody . &quot;
man after Ap@@ c@@ urs@@ ed arrested
the police on the weekend was arrested for a man after a cl@@ ash with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent pits in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was supplied with the helic@@ opter in the Royal Melbourne Hospital with heavy injury and returned after a car on the Satur@@ day@@ morning on the Murray @-@ Valley highway .
the police said the motor@@ ists continue to drive without stopping to help the latter rider .
on Monday a 50 year old man from Nath@@ alia was the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
it is expected to be charged with res@@ c@@ urs@@ ed and under @-@ abandoned bon@@ ding and due to other traffic @-@ deli@@ ties .

Melbourne @-@ Stor@@ m @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals for alleg@@ ations to ring fight
Melbourne @-@ Stor@@ m @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has identified criticism of his player as &quot; &quot; Agenda S@@ etting &quot; &quot; of two Premier League &apos;s Favorites of the NR@@ L . &quot;
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee allows the Stor@@ m @-@ players &quot; ring competitions &quot; with his team during the high penalty victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Ben@@ nett made a little hidden note to the Stor@@ m team , after his team obtained the final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; &quot; example &quot; of Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland does not &apos; too good &quot; in the rings . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy Defense defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his crew and said that they can only be focused on their &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; tactics . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy , added that the criticism of two leading trainers on his team I confi@@ dently announce it , as it pre@@ y that they were worried about the Stor@@ m team . &quot;
&quot; that looks always up again - I did not hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about Ring@@ struggles , when they left us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that in the whole year we have changed nothing at our def@@ ective system or techniques . but during the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es to a real focus , and this has provided us with the trend . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not acc@@ ust@@ omed to losing , so it was a bit of shock for him . &quot;
it is already strange that this time again appears at this time of year .
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked the kind of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Ben@@ net@@ is St George Ill@@ awar@@ ra Dragons &apos;s Premier League won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; baby . &quot;
Way@@ ne talks about exciting football .
he died his game on Saturday evening with our Sunday evening and how exciting their play was &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was considered as a boring team and Way@@ ne pointed out that he will take care of a sli@@ der for it .
&quot; but now he has a team who can play and which we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game that you want to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as they can . &quot;
&quot; I have stronger trust in because they say these things , because they are a bit worried to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they probably didn &apos;t think of us than the big games went .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Stor@@ m against Roo@@ sters obtained a higher result than the game of bronze against co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is it an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks ? do not make a bit of cl@@ amping ?
for me there are the plans .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet in a phase still on them . &quot;
&quot; the Stor@@ m team has free at this weekend since they won the right , either North Queensland Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks in the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AMI park . ticket sales will start starting tomorrow . &quot;
&quot; serv@@ o with 200,000 $ Deposit to drug s@@ qui@@ age &quot;
&quot; a man who may possibly come to a lifetime punishment in the possession of 40 kil@@ ograms of Kok@@ ain who were winding out after Queensland , was released against a deposit of 200,000 deposits . &quot;
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the police demanded 100 kg of the drug at the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August at Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he def@@ endants his co @-@ accused in the course of the morning and later at Café Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ adh@@ ouse where the police found 40 kil@@ ograms of the drug in an Toyota echo .
&quot; despite a possibly long @-@ term punishment for the attempt to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café , could have been for an inno@@ cu@@ ous reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the escape of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday . &quot;
in the criminal case he has sur@@ rendered the police on his place of residence .
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s Mother and Sti@@ ef@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve its release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the two @-@ scale explanations of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Ju@@ dge D@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from going , not to appear . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was fre@@ ed against deposit , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Ser@@ b pass , and en@@ rolled in the police on a daily basis and stick to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to attract couples to sending pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es used the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand images of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl when this asleep , log@@ ged into an online mess@@ aging service that received a number of in@@ decent pictures of children that were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the telephone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping h@@ og@@ g .
it looked through it found the conf@@ using messages and alar@@ ming immediately its mother .
&quot; the police took care of the five pictures , analy@@ zed then computer which were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; relevant &quot; &quot; Web research , the terms used for the search of in@@ decent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then said to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; P@@ sel@@ oph@@ ile in the Internet , &quot; and he then called , a polic@@ eman , to sc@@ are them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ ie Robert@@ son said the Dun@@ de@@ e Sher@@ i@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be a Su@@ cht , that he is addi@@ ctive , people fright@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; he gave that the addiction to the computer have been carried out by him , but said it was done , because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to scar@@ ce a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures , and he asked him to send more photos . &quot;
he said he did so to enti@@ ce them .
&quot; he said he is sick in his head , if he dro@@ wns , and said , he wants to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; added : &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the tre@@ m@@ bling and crying . &quot;
she then saw also the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and made the def@@ endants .
&quot; the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and Play@@ station used to speak with girls , who looked much younger than him . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , who declared to have resum@@ ed in the context of the indic@@ t@@ ment un@@ signed pictures of children on 14 June last year and not to have appeared before the court for a hearing on 24 March of this year . &quot;
&quot; Gregor Gregor S@@ im currently asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , since one could argue that there is no considerable sexual element in his head . &quot;
Sher@@ i@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ m@@ ich@@ ael disp@@ ers@@ ed the judgment of judgment until October to keep background reports on social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was mentioned in this case if cancelled , but was held in cust@@ ody for hear@@ ings at other cases . &quot;
it was added before the date of the jud@@ g@@ ments into the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
Sch@@ le@@ user soft to small bor@@ der@@ ings with Germany from
more and more refugees are approached by the Grand border inspection at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many lam@@ bs made out of fear of discovery and det@@ ention people multip@@ lies in smaller bor@@ der@@ ings .
&quot; on the Austrian side , there was a spokes@@ man from the police force . &quot;
along the border river Inn we have been picked up in the districts of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday more than 1000 refugees .
they were on foot over bridges and bar@@ cel@@ ess on the German side .
there they are taken home by police police and passed on to registration .
at the Munich Central Station ( Munich Central Bank ) met for more refugees during the weekend of the weekend in comparison to the weekend in the beginning of the weekend .
&quot; only until 8 : 00 p.m. , around 700 people in the state capital , arrived , said a speaker in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re @-@ establishment of controls at the Franco @-@ Austrian border , the city had reached the city on Tuesday 17@@ 59 . &quot;
Stuttgart : le@@ pers of Tro@@ pen@@ stur@@ m &quot; Henry &quot; in the South@@ west expected

&quot; due to a low pressure area of Western Europe , warm sea currents at present are currently part of the German Wetter@@ dienst ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart with Germany . &quot;
&quot; the powerful bass is the un@@ ner of the Tro@@ pics &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; , &quot; which was drawn over the Atlantic Ocean over the past few days . &quot;
fier@@ ce storms and th@@ under@@ storm are expected above all in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , until Thursday morning also in the Black @-@ Forest , on the Schwä@@ b@@ ó@@ b and at the Lake @-@ seek@@ ers with Bö@@ ll of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour . &quot;
after Friday the sun can be no longer able to look at the sun again .
the mass does it : every two years the high@@ s at the I@@ AA show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; in 2015 , it is especially important for the compact cars to record them especially well . &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in special demand : approximately 28.@@ 1 per cent of the re @-@ appro@@ vals were falling al@@ located in August to this segment alone in August .
this is reflected in the I@@ AA ( audience days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new upper @-@ Class cars and luxury cars are presented here , especially for many new compact models . &quot;
one of the biggest Premi@@ ers for the German auto industry is the Opel Astr@@ a which will stand at its de@@ aler@@ ships during the autumn .
&quot; the Astr@@ a is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann in the show . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; the volume model can also be well sold , the new Astr@@ a will not become much more expensive . &quot;
Rüssel@@ sheim . Opel is launching an entrance below the largest ri@@ val of the VW Golf in prospect which starts at 17 650 euros .
&quot; the current Astr@@ a will cost from 16 990 . &quot;
&quot; the Astr@@ a is available with a new 1,@@ 4 @-@ l@@ iter engine with 74 kW / 100 HP . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the Hessen , further diesel and gas@@ oline engines of 70 kW / 95 HP to 147 kW / / 200 b@@ hp , for the first time includes three @-@ cylinder gas@@ oline engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important ri@@ vals VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astr@@ a is initially only as five @-@ fifth . &quot;
&quot; as a second variant will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which is also already visible at the I@@ AA . &quot;
and what will drive to new compact cars next to Astr@@ a on the I@@ AA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astr@@ a @-@ competi@@ tor in the race .
at the fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively as five @-@ fifth in a conventional and a stressed sporting scene version .
&quot; trade at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : very new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan Alliance wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; however , the compact focal point fits itself with its wel@@ ded lines fully into the design line of the brand . &quot;
the basic model will get a gas@@ oline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 PS .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno segment in Frankfurt celeb@@ rates its world premiere .
&quot; the model with gas@@ oline engines , including a newly developed 1,0 @-@ lit@@ re @-@ Tur@@ bom@@ bas@@ or and an output of 82 kW / 111 HP . &quot;
the maximum speed of the torque lies with 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
the start of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not completely new but completely renewed , the comp@@ actor @-@ model model DS 4 , is shown on the I@@ AA . &quot;
&quot; on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n read@@ ers laid hands on the front@@ print : here the cooler model was re@@ drawn and the altered head@@ lights equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior area , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , reduced the number of buttons by a touch@@ screen , and is the first Ap@@ ples car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; added to the I@@ AA in the compact class , a series of lectures and new variants such as the face @-@ up Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot drop GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ T@@ egel : five square meters are un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given a former prisoners from the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary T@@ egel , which were accommod@@ ated once a month in a small cell . &quot;
&quot; due to the violation of its human dignity , in@@ mates were generally entitled to financial compensation , when they are placed in small cells . &quot;
this resolution has adopted the Federal Constitutional Court in one on Wednesday .
sufferers may cause the judges even if they were locked into tight spaces only a few days in the surrounding areas ( A@@ z . 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
&quot; this was an explosion prison@@ er with his constitutional review in Karlsruhe : he was placed in a quad@@ ru@@ ple room with approximately five square meters of ground floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who has been able to get according to the particulars of his for@@ ested by now on the open foot in a larger cell . &quot;
his accus@@ ation had failed against the land of Berlin because of the un@@ worthy liability conditions .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Court , the judgment of the chamber in Berlin and transferred the case to renewed examination . &quot;
you will see the man &apos;s lives in@@ ju@@ red .
Kam@@ mer@@ Court now decides on compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons of the deadline for compensation only a few days of pen@@ tion for compensation , be decisive , it was meant . &quot;
otherwise a lack of legal protection of the personality would be to fear .
the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ als must now clarify the level of performance damage .
the rec@@ ti@@ fication in the past often have strengthened the rights of prisoners of punishment .
&quot; so first of April they spoke to in@@ dem@@ nity for dem@@ nity , because he was imprison@@ ed naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; the human @-@ un@@ worthy of a decision of 2011 , also according to the majority of the cell of a cell , without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , he also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had made an in@@ decent lodging in a prison@@ er in November 2009 . &quot;
the dam c@@ ater was across three months a day between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell , as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
the Berlin pr@@ isons were also due to lack of personnel in the head@@ lines over the past few weeks .
&quot; prisoners are therefore always included in 23 hours , the aggressi@@ vity increases , even to s@@ laughter it should have been due to the tense situation . &quot;
&quot; after information of the judicial system , 21 places in T@@ egel because of young @-@ young parties are not occupied , 19 should be dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what is coming to Germany ?
&quot; approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are coming to Germany according to forecasts of the German Federal Ministry of Culture this year , according to the statement by vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to absor@@ b one million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated the face of the un@@ common challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do it again and we can create it .
what is related to Germany lies the following overview .
&quot; according to various forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of State ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute ) , each year - and the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built before ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; dramatic is the lack of living space but especially in paid rentals : per year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing came from ten@@ ants , and in order to apply this very favorable apartments also refugees apply . &quot;
&quot; Bundes@@ minist@@ ries Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the promotion , of currently 518 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute : 80 000 social housing need to emerge annually , and for this , the federal government would have to invest in height of 6.6 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; in agreement , scientists and Bundes@@ minist@@ ries agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing . &quot;
&quot; according to the Institute of labour market and employment research , it is estimated that 55 percent of the refugees were en@@ counter@@ f@@ aded in Germany in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically after their qualifications to help them get started by Claudia Walter , project man@@ ag@@ ter for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial to find whether they are working in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the esteem in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the migrants , says mig@@ rations of the Diet@@ rich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , it has been a political turn : from labour ban for refugees to recognition of work . &quot;
&quot; while earlier a job offered for asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years ago , this reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the residen@@ cy light , the asylum seek@@ ers have limited to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the shortage of skilled labour movement - mostly argu@@ ably the point of view that refugees should be made quicker and access to the labour market . &quot;
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lack of interpretation .
&quot; until now , there is not yet an adequate supply of general and special @-@ related language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often convey@@ ed by personal contact .
the building of networks is therefore to think by thr@@ h@@ hardt of the Köni@@ gs@@ weg to work @-@ integration .
&quot; the Berlin school administration has established that only a few refugees can give their children to the kite , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the kidn@@ apped parents , it is only once very important to hold the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sch@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , manage the hand notes in various languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators asc@@ end with a large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would attempt to increase the training capacity by offering more specialist schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students without a knowledge of the welcome classes are prepared for classes . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always instruc@@ ted by fully trained lectur@@ ers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teacher , who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate St@@ els from Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Student@@ en@@ werk is estimated that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principle , no state asylum seek@@ ers or Ge@@ dul@@ ated the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enk@@ el ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position . &quot;
academic refugees could be made easier to the university .
&quot; for refugees with a residence or den@@ ul@@ sion , no services received after the asylum application of asylum law , if they begin studying . &quot;
&quot; in principle , there is not a BA@@ Fö@@ G , as they do not fall under the list of hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; frau@@ dul@@ ated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for BA@@ Fö@@ G , from 1 January 2016 onwards , this pan is shorten@@ ed to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing must also be closed , ask Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin@@ s State Secretary for Science , and the German Student@@ en@@ werk . &quot;
the students should get immediately BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; Islam will in future play a more important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should seize the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches have to develop right to a new state of religions . &quot;
&quot; it was also important for the establishment of an Islamic welfare state , of which professional takes care of the Neu@@ ch@@ ests . &quot;
the rights also belong to the rights .
&quot; so , the representatives of Islam must agree to agree on clear contact persons and to act with the state in many areas and to prepare certain controls . &quot;
this also belongs to the willingness to set against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be registered after Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to keep such conflicts in Germany , &quot; have immediately their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will be much more likely than today being a topic of society .
the majority of society will also have to alter the dismant@@ ling of discrimination and racism .
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a anti @-@ discrimination situation and a general gender equality law since a scar@@ ce decade .
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly , like the NS@@ U @-@ M@@ ord@@ serie revealed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist mot@@ if . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migration organisations and stakeholders are non @-@ working associations , and why international treaties such as the anti @-@ racial crises , Germany must commit to reality in the coming years , when the country is peaceful and its new citizens are to be able to use their own opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide for the so @-@ awa@@ ited refugees medi@@ cally , vice @-@ president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery holds . &quot;
&quot; as for Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create it , &quot; &quot; said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , what additional money could be used into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid engaging , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls on all com@@ ers to be suspended immediately during the registration of health types . &quot;
the services could later be settled with the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able , so many people are charged with the limited power catalog , which see the asylum application law . &quot;
otherwise make the doctors especially to create language barriers .
&quot; so far , the Berlin health @-@ learning the@@ a Bor@@ de has been proven , migrants are worse worse than their disease than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in doctors , would have to accept interpre@@ ter &apos;s fees . &quot;
&quot; in addition , many refugees would also be helped with more common medical ana@@ esth@@ esia . &quot;
and with another diagnostic look .
&quot; among refugees , there are much more untreated disabilities ; and among the young people go to HIV education . &quot;
&quot; with the sometimes other illness images of the German doctors of their training , but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not as difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; and what is concerned by the hass@@ le of emergency , be even mi@@ tigation in sight through the refugees . &quot;
&quot; Syri@@ ans would have developed a highly developed education system , several refugees and even doctors . &quot;
&quot; if they are allowed to practice , they would have to prove their qualifications and re@@ consider again trials . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees in Germany followed by estimates of the bund@@ le psych@@ otherap@@ et ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , most suffering from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress @-@ depres@@ sive or less depression . &quot;
&quot; especially vulnerable refugee camps , explains Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent published study of TU München shows that each fifth Syrian refugee camps is disp@@ ens@@ ed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer in a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress is suffering from among other things , is suffering from the so @-@ called fl@@ ash@@ backs with respir@@ atory , ver@@ tig@@ o , heart tur@@ f and death @-@ ti@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; further symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders , strong vel@@ ar@@ ness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms are chron@@ ically , be an early treatment necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; so far , only four percent of the psychological sufferers have received a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psychological sufferers in the social offices may make an application for psych@@ otherapy , but the processing usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in the welfare state or doctors , who are not trained for the psychological diseases , decide whether a therapy would be necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this frequently lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
man@@ ege invite to dreams
with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion &quot; re@@ igns the Circus itself on the traditions of cir@@ cus .
&quot; the goal is to pull every age group in the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ ses and unique entertainment . &quot;
&quot; now , the cir@@ cus loads in the ring on the brick , was@@ ps to dream . &quot;
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie , vet and juni@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this slogan means the current Man@@ eg@@ en@@ st@@ aging . &quot;
&quot; for over 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the family . &quot;
the gift to inspire the family is thus in the blood .
&quot; it is important for us to take the people from their everyday life , and take them to take two hours into a completely different world , &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year Jun@@ i@@ ands . &quot;
&quot; man@@ eg@@ old cock@@ tail with world @-@ flair &quot; , &quot; so the director Reinhard rehear@@ st calls his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair .
the program of cir@@ cus is convinced with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; excellent at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ lic@@ ar@@ ov Clo@@ wn Family moves the audience with wit and charm in her spell . &quot;
also the Castillo Brothers understand their craft .
with the heroes of the film films it wants to take up the Cub@@ an duo .
light@@ ness and mot@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
your hum@@ orous art on the m@@ ast should conquer the women &apos;s her@@ on in the storm .
&quot; besides , thanks to numerous black sal@@ v@@ ae , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus itself also proved with finger@@ tips and joint . &quot;
with the wheel on a ball bal@@ ancing ?
for He Yuan is not a problem .
sn@@ ake men fascin@@ ate and start@@ ling at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of the ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascinated with their flexibility .
60 employees from twelve countries offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ mother , Brigitte @-@ proven . &quot;
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus are only too often subject to different animal rights organisations .
&quot; Stephanie , also takes position in this position : &quot; &quot; is our animals not well , but we are not going well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every string unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ legged arti@@ ste &quot; , &quot; as they are lovingly called , will be read by the eyes every wish . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the ring . &quot;
the su@@ preme requirement is : good for the animals care .
&quot; specially designed for her z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land@@ Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a z@@ ebra @-@ mare , the family is well @-@ proof . &quot;
the two animals have lived in a pen and nothing has happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , was our little Jum@@ bo da , &quot; says Brigitte tried . &quot;
&quot; while the z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id is not ready for the ring , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus itself . &quot;
there is something for every visitor to be something .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephanie , &quot; says Ms. rehear@@ st : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spect@@ ators , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
the Circus Festival loads from 17 to 20 September every day at 5 pm and 8 pm .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
&quot; Thursday is family Day , for the presentation at 17 o &apos;clock , the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au from 10 am to 6 pm open daily . &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mug@@ abe holds a false speech in the parliament today
&quot; Mr Mug@@ abe , Afri@@ ca@@ est Guide , fell down at the beginning of the year from a podium . &quot;
&quot; he remained in@@ ju@@ red , but the video of the fall quickly became popular with soci@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the Parliament was also har@@ dened by declar@@ ations of the opposition of the opposition that they had received anonymous deaths , and they were warned of to accompany the speech by Mr Mug@@ abe by Bu@@ hr@@ alled . &quot;
&quot; last month , they had fixed him and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the nation in parliament - this is the talk he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Op@@ positions politicians have received SMS messages on their mobil@@ es that they warned against Mr. Mug@@ ab@@ es .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but she has the title &quot; death &apos; , &quot; he said journalists to Mug@@ ab@@ es . &quot;
&quot; they warned the Parliament members that termin@@ ates the immunity of the Parliament , and once they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity are no longer effective . &quot;
&quot; the Chief spokes@@ man said that &quot; &quot; Morgan T@@ sv@@ ang@@ ir@@ ai guided &quot; &quot; is concerned about the dangers for politicians . &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard Company will build up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25.000 for 30.000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts at the company &apos;s services .
HP will later share in two listed companies and share the computer and printer business from its fast growing business hardware and service activities .
&quot; expected job break@@ down leads to a burden of more than 2,@@ 7 billion dollars as of the fourth quarter , HP stated in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will make a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; said me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ chair and Chief Executive , which will lead the unity after separation . &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise is smaller and stronger than it is HP today and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of stores that support companies during transition to a new style of business &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better placed than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion &quot; annual revenue and &quot; will focus on the provision of previously un@@ att@@ ain@@ able , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company . &quot;
&quot; it spl@@ its a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the gradu@@ ates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett @-@ Packard , creating electric plants and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage was called &quot; &quot; birth@@ place of the Sili@@ con Valley &quot; . &quot; &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to cope with the return of traditional PCs into mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide a better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ capitals Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mate must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it is only September and provided his rehabilitation after plan , there is no reason why he cannot play before Christmas again . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely be missed at least the next four games for England and in face of its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain . &quot;
&quot; the big shame on this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere ended the last season after a separate ank@@ ering breaking , and then returned to its old swing during the pres@@ eas@@ on . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatened by the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; it is a bone , which is not well @-@ healing . &quot;
this is not a major matter .
this was only an accident .
it was not in connection with his buttons or with the injury he had previously had .
&quot; this may be true from purely medical viewpoint , but as spiral also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player attempts to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it is also developing an uncomfortable pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd passed 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of arsen@@ als 157 league games in the last five seasons .
&quot; the wider picture for arsen@@ al is , that in six out of eight players since 2007 / 08 of one of the two Premier League Clubs , have been able to record most viol@@ ability days . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the risk of vulner@@ ability continues during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if you come from an injury , you will have a temporary period , a time when you strengthen your body and win martial force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the Olympics against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham hot@@ track on the coming Wednesday , and turning a rotation among the team . &quot;
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelling to Croatia where Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of night Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to hold the balance and to give players it need to give a little sno@@ o@@ off , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal is clear favourites , by group F back , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is part of the game places with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o has also been unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was started in the last season . &quot;
the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday night through an earthquake and measured on the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3 .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that arsen@@ al drew the lessons of the past season with the Champions League event against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope , with his management the club to lead to its first European ap@@ ocal@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked out in Arsenal .
&quot; we were very close to the year 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ s@@ feast : the com@@ edy show who has given us serious lessons of men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves now even more dist@@ res@@ sing than ever before , such as self @-@ mor@@ als in young men prove to a 15 year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important deaths among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ im ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a her@@ edit@@ ary life ) 2015 when the man &apos;s aim to ask the culture to seek help when they need these . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the battle to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent study conducted at over 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms displayed that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; &quot; healthy mind &quot; , &quot; his chances of recovery . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of spirit@@ ually healthy friends the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course one has to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of more social media , with its focus on style on substance , the in@@ medi@@ ability of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have the need to make strong , life @-@ funny and successful to appear , even if in reality domin@@ ating isolation . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by that which psych@@ ologists call ins@@ ular values ; money , image , social status , everything on cost intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not be bought . &quot;
&quot; the beauty of Friends was , that this focuss@@ ing on the head was placed . &quot;
&quot; each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which gli@@ stering through the interaction as friend . &quot;
&quot; the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s h@@ ugs to football h@@ ugs in cozy chair and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all that came from knowing that men can definitely hold back , even though they are often res@@ trained to explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; like an employee of the phone care , explained to me : ... &quot; my audi@@ ble role for people who are de@@ pressed and self @-@ confident , has clearly shown how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to talk with friends .
&quot; the old speech &quot; I come with it &quot; has a tremendous impact , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when one speaks about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term travel mechanisms .
they clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so very my objective out@@ sider on the phone to look at moments , too , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Festival with the commemor@@ ative celebration of the day completely newly designed setting , why do not take your friends a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you see somebody alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give it a smile and say hello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could do .
friends is sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the whole 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to zer@@ m@@ mal@@ ate
angel Di Maria celeb@@ rates Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ar@@ son Cav@@ ani according to his hit by Hun@@ edo@@ ara .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to take on Malmö .
here are the Game Report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ar@@ son Cav@@ ani held course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against mal@@ m@@ ö in the prince stadium of Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they increased their advantage , than Cav@@ ani made a head@@ rest in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k , also in group A , Paris requires a strong start to the Swedish master , since it is not only the qualification for the N.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ alists of each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a class@@ esp@@ iel of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ o@@ vic@@ s missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later in play against his hom@@ etown team and against the association , with which he began his illustr@@ ative career already in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or up@@ side in the Champions League . so it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to gain our opponents issues and look back relaxed , even if there are certain things we have to perf@@ ected throughout the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , even though I regret that we have not yet scored one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic turned back after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris Team , which was on the weekend last a 2 @-@ 2 accident at his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was engra@@ ved in the fourth minute by Di Mary . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine @-@ stor@@ mer was described as the man who was taking on the next stage in Europe , when he was taken over the last month by Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malmö defense even before he closed to Johan Wil@@ and gone nicely into the long corner of the grid . &quot;
&quot; if someone believed that PS@@ G would have a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off proposed to achieve this level , joined in An@@ pi@@ ff with nine National players on the field and ended with a five @-@ man defence and two deep in the mid@@ field . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who went far to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten at the 34@@ th minute , they offered them little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; in the end , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave himself up , with some mis@@ carriage and bad abor@@ tions , not least by I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , who were in no less than five attempts alone in the first half , and then given up after Cav@@ ani had rest@@ art@@ ed him after the rest@@ art . &quot;
&quot; and he took a lot more skill , when he carried his pe@@ er into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic to convert the Di Mary into a swi@@ f@@ uss , which was passing by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole . &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hours @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the famous ay@@ er thus generated his sixth season , after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic had set up a left fl@@ ank of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; it ended all thoughts to think that Malmö can return to the game , and only an excellent input from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to keep David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before replacement player Ez@@ av@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi described a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the Trainer of Malmö , Age Har@@ ms , gave later to that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwegian said , &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , which did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification @-@ games are not enough . &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

&quot; FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago just before the obligation of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , which then played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger , four times champion teams , two times club champion , two times European master , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in summer , the day of 35 @-@ year @-@ old , after 24 years left the FC Barcelona and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now reveals that he stood before the departure from Barcelona before the European Championship 2008 . &quot;
they told me that Bar@@ ça would like to sell me .
&quot; Madrid then won everything , we told nothing . &quot;
and the registered age of FC Bayern .
&quot; X@@ avi : &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
&quot; to remember : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
guar@@ di@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi was not inter@@ change@@ able
but the switch did not come about .
and the be@@ zz@@ ling man worked for the German record @-@ master : PE@@ P guar@@ dian .
&quot; X@@ avi explained , why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has removed Guardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great voice . &quot;
&quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change , that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot;
&quot; so he has brought me up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; who knows how Bay@@ erns Spiel@@ zeit 2008 / 2009 with X@@ avi , would run . &quot;

Matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film @-@ creating
Matt Dam@@ on met the af@@ ro@@ American fil@@ mm@@ aker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said they are not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday night from H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown is interrupted for the need for alternative perspectives while related to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists , elected to the project . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about variety , then do it with the occupation of the film and not when cast the show , &quot; assured &quot; Dam@@ on . &quot;
brown re@@ acted cked with animated un@@ belief and called &quot; hoo ! Wow . okay , as the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian &apos;s aston@@ ished . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the Produ@@ c@@ un@@ enk@@ oll@@ egen Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director , as they treat the figure of harmony , &quot; said Brown first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a nuts being beat by her white sugar . &quot;
&quot; the Producer of De@@ ar White People set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio , for the director &apos;s rights to the film . &quot;
&quot; after the debate has been broad@@ cast@@ ed , the soci@@ als of media were found before dis@@ approval on Dam@@ on comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter &apos;s Mr Po@@ oni oppressed his W@@ ut about the clip from , by wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on , talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their variety - that &apos;s SO GO@@ ISS that it hur@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et earned over 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 libraries since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on comments come at a time when there is the exact racial representation in the media at the top of the social discussion .
&quot; after the Teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in the year 2014 by a white police officer , the movement of Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter had been achieved by anti @-@ discrimin@@ atory practices and authorities , discrimin@@ atory practices against color exploitation . &quot;
in February Prince Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nom@@ ination of the year by the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; Alb@@ ums are weaker , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , songs still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; more recently , leader of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter were published a statement and in response to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elizabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hat@@ red group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love @-@ group , &quot; said the guides . &quot;
&quot; recently , I was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media players who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss about the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he has accepted the invitation or he had already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos; American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; cryp@@ t First Champion
&quot; professional sports weather and operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ l@@ ete , who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took the Grand Prix of 1 million $ with home . &quot;
&quot; the competition @-@ show that completed just her 7th season , had never experienced a contest competi@@ tor , who was able to complete all levels of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the end @-@ season there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , to the final . &quot;
the last task belonged to the climbing on a 75 feet long climbing time in 30 seconds .
&quot; we ended the task within the time with what he finished the first ath@@ l@@ ete , who finished the ti@@ ring phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with e ! messages according to the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock through the profit of the great price of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I never earn more than 10,000 $ or had a lifetime , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his bunch of money . &quot;
suddenly all of sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the finals and why B@@ ritten , although he finished first at all the course , not any prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one at the quick@@ est time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed ; it receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t believe that he will have a gro@@ ove over it .
he is just as happy to have done what he did .
&quot; masses of awards , he received from fans . &quot;
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be be@@ aten from someone , then I am glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
&quot; and I think that Isaac did so , if they had changed the roles . &quot;
&quot; America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or was extended for a eighth season , the filming will start in the spring of 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak to Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins over
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially fun for the Detroit tiger .
earlier they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball than today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as a Spo@@ ile , however , this part played perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field . &quot;
the tw@@ ins squ@@ ander@@ ed a chance to climb within a game of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ Card square .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word which was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad . &quot;
&quot; Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fredo Simon gave his early offensive support u@@ pri@@ ght , when Detroit was held in the first two inn@@ ings , then in the sixth and then once again in the ninth time . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) suggested for 6 times in 1 / 3 internal and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was just the third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year greatly , &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to throw in the bull@@ bar each game , and therefore I will fully concentrate in the game . &quot;
the chosen tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks ; his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on 6 July . &quot;
&quot; he has good put the stri@@ ony well , &quot; said Pil@@ gri@@ m . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( stroke training ) , looked clearly better in the Bull@@ pen , and he put it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three of us at the end of the seventh Inn@@ ing , T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into the game again . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ ding Byr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks finished a B@@ unt and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ ors to Stri@@ ke@@ out before joining the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy went to the wall , the only man , with whom he was confronted , before the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ ed Rookie group Miguel S@@ ano , who escaped a two @-@ Run installation . &quot;
with a pair of run@@ ners and the completion @-@ run on the second brought exp@@ iry of the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
&quot; it was the major league leading 27 times in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double Play . &quot;
after Detroit added to the end of the ne@@ at Inn@@ ings a Insurance @-@ Run the wall of an R@@ BI @-@ Double against the C@@ loose of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and recorded the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
&quot; however , the right @-@ handed sc@@ arf however S@@ ano is made for three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save . &quot;
Detroit prof@@ ited to the pr@@ el@@ ude of the game by one still not movable Phil H@@ ugh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the R@@ igh@@ thand@@ ed veter@@ an , who had been canc@@ eled before the game from the viol@@ ability list after a back of suffering more than a month . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I have wished for , &quot; said H@@ ugh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I did away and feel that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after being released in the first the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ bat@@ ter , Hus@@ ton gave a spe@@ edi@@ ble to second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to the game that made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed its 0 @-@ 21 track series with the run@@ ners in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman of Nick Castell@@ anos followed by a single on the right , made another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game , when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second to meet a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not take a very well , but he caught the right place . &quot;
H@@ ugh@@ es found himself in a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count where he had not scored points in the third inning before he replaced with the rel@@ ic justi@@ fications A.@@ J.@@ Ax@@ ter .
&quot; at H@@ ugh@@ es , it came to three R@@ us with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs . &quot;
note : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ chez was due to a violation of the worm pal@@ ac@@ ter .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who op@@ ted the shoulder of San@@ chez in 2007 .

tens of thousands of refugees crossed the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ er@@ es from Hungary to Austria last days .
your goal is usually to Germany .
ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit for the next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states so far failed to agree on a common approach to the crisis .
the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding arrangement of more than 120 000 refugees on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
&quot; given the high net income in Germany , the federal government wants to support the federal government at first @-@ time and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will ship this together with the states , announced on the late meeting with the Prime Minister at the Federal President in Berlin in the late meeting . &quot;
&quot; Merkel emphas@@ ised , those people who bro@@ kes protection , be@@ et these too . &quot;
&quot; but who did not have a prosp@@ ective perspective , could not remain in Germany too . &quot;
this point of view was divided into the round .
the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed that the state as a whole must now be a &quot; huge power of force . &quot;
thousands of dist@@ res@@ sed refugees have now stuck on the route route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia in the night .

the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
there was first det@@ ention of people who under@@ cut the fence .

no diet @-@ fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; but who wants to pay attention to its sl@@ ender line , this will often be dis@@ continued by them . &quot;
because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially Sac@@ char@@ ose .

&quot; by buying , Mang@@ os should not be too soft or too firm and cre@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; the shell@@ fish color alone says nothing about how ri@@ pe the fruit is - so you can taste green man@@ gan@@ os very tasty . &quot;
you should store at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then they taste them pure or in sweet dishes .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther square
nearly 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther square .
&quot; on Wednesday , President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino has been bap@@ tised in the Park on the Opp@@ io Hill in the name of the German reform@@ ists on Wednesday . &quot;
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park lies in the middle of Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lu@@ ther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often only live in hidden their faith . &quot;
&quot; with the place become visible in a symbolic way , that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Lu@@ ther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k to the annual turn 15@@ 10 / 11 some months in Rome .
he received the town then as a pre@@ y sin@@ ner .
his negative impressions are likely to have raised him in his later battle against Rome in his later battle against Rome .
Lu@@ ther had then introduced with his th@@ eses against the distr@@ ust @-@ trade in the split of the ab@@ sent church .
Hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible .
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ gold ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main works that has painted the Ot@@ mar Old for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and a bi@@ ased tex@@ te .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now released with splendid images . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Old , who in 150 reasons his own personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical stories on paper and canvas has formulated . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms got the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the respective subjects cannot be quite gri@@ m . &quot;
&quot; around three years , Ot@@ co Alt has been working on his bi@@ ble @-@ project , for which he made a subjective @-@ artistic choice of the many topics of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these were developed cycles , which devote themselves to themes such as cru@@ ises , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; therefore , he has spont@@ aneously fascinated as many partners : this applies to the Lu@@ ther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publisher with his emphasis on artificial books . &quot;
and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost devoted to the paintings of painting with the respective Bible points .
&quot; he interpreted the Bible for the &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt selected Bi@@ bel@@ ungs &quot; &quot; and is now translated into current relations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; nestled in the original Pan@@ ven@@ z@@ itat of Martin Lu@@ ther , each one of the artist , who has formulated his very personal thoughts of each situation here . &quot;
the jewelry @-@ band is Golden Let@@ ters .
&quot; so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old simultaneously allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intimacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately at all trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant ruler . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s the education already happened to the cane , &quot; is remin@@ is@@ cent of the Oth@@ mar . &quot;
&quot; I tried to work that , to be able to carry me again with the Lord father again . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to help the art in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed time to more significance : &quot; &quot; the perception of image wel@@ ten is today characterised by prec@@ kl@@ ame , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is there being pushed .
artists have a different desire and glad@@ ness to show things .
pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewer be in the pictures , &quot; &quot; go on , &quot; &quot; discover and sense what power they have , &quot; &quot; the picture looks for his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost began to be on Tuesday when the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , has always been &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst , &quot; &quot; I like , how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; I have not heard the Bible to fully grasp the Bible , but which is important for him important , including mysterious themes . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text explained merely . &quot; &quot;

DF@@ B intensified efforts for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees to 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga continues to set a clear sign on weekends . &quot;
&quot; the football has re@@ acted to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany , and ensuring the policy of addressing the problems with tackling the challenges of tackling the future problems . &quot;
&quot; I consider it the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification .
&quot; there is no man in principle that nothing goes on , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; this must be interesting for each individual to get a handle on this subject , &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the ch@@ anc@@ ellor and tre@@ ach , there the Minister of Govern@@ ors , Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; there will certainly play a central role on this issue , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football can and wants to assist .
but the decisive woman must place politics .
the German Bundes@@ federal government has therefore expanded its refugees &apos; 1 : 0 for a welcome &apos; four years .
&quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun &apos;s Foundation , we ensured that this program continues to run until 2019 , &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
even some Bundes@@ liga team support this program .
&quot; already at this weekend the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ ti put a clear sign when she will take place on the left Tri@@ kot@@ z@@ mel instead of the usual pri@@ mor@@ e@@ logos ( Her@@ mes ) , we will help - # Booking &apos; welcome . &quot;
&quot; we also want to make clear that all of us should help , where and how they can only be , &quot; &quot; Lever@@ nin@@ ety Sport@@ di V@@ ö@@ ller read the &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) , and described the project as &quot; &quot; a matter of course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee Drama goes every one , but it should not be seen . &quot;
&quot; we will be able to use football , no , we need to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so unbeliev@@ ably , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ unvei@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent character of the League . &quot;
&quot; to the EM qualification round in Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women receives 100 refugees in Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Ni@@ ers@@ bach discussed the support of refugees as a &quot; large joint work of German football . &quot;
that all 36 states have launched their own projects in their place is awesome .
just as great it is that small and smallest one is active .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; , &quot; which we have spent , is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; this year , together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government , the association provides at EUR 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the associations have already called up the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
reports : SAP @-@ Vor@@ os@@ ef loses an eye in accident
&quot; the ruler of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has reported the left eye to several reports according to the fall of July . &quot;
&quot; if the accident at the stair@@ way in the house of his brother in the USA he fell after midnight on a water@@ way , which he carried on his left hand reports the &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost ble@@ eding , it was power@@ less , then left out to@@ wed to the street - that he told us so last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ thin &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ling . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could prove his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Turn@@ table . &quot;
the 54 year old manager was in the meeting and &quot; is full of labor . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday release ) . he will come back to Germany in October and continue to match the software .
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I stood in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and his chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ ited between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer working in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; for him it is important to go to the public with such a personal history , &quot; said the manager of &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen so something . &quot;
&quot; important is to be stopped , when you stop . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ sia except skir@@ m@@ ish ...
&quot; tou@@ ching was a corresponding picture and stated , he suffered the violation as he was thrown by bike . &quot;
&quot; he therefore comes from entering in Singapore the weekend as little as a reserve for the two family members Fernando Al@@ on@@ so , and Jen@@ son Button or question , like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ us@@ sia , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us have finally sm@@ ashed in the first group game of the Europa League . &quot;
the national player is also missing the leader of the Bundes@@ liga also in Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 pm / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot rely on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ Game against Lever@@ k@@ usen , so the BV@@ B @-@ Coach is open : &quot; we expect a return from him into the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high burden of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his gene@@ alog@@ ical position at the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ post position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes place the place of tri@@ ke@@ eper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he exercises on an absolute top @-@ level , &quot; praised the football teacher the world master . &quot;
&quot; whether the course is to be used in all Europe league games , Tu@@ ch@@ el made however open . &quot;
with high probability he will also spr@@ ite the second game .
&quot; the for@@ bi@@ al statement by fellow @-@ player real@@ us that the final withdrawal for the BV@@ B in the Europa League mission is to be the goal of the mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for understandable : &quot; &quot; this is why Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to access the title .
robot au@@ tos : government wants to play a pioneer for Germany
&quot; following the will of the federal government , Germany should be the forefront in the change of the car of technological advancement . &quot;
&quot; the Bundes@@ hut , decided on Wednesday a Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ier from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse I@@ AA from a &quot; &quot; new Mobility &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; automated driving tests will increase traffic safety and ensure less jams , &quot; &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
&quot; he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who come together with representatives of the industry on the I@@ AA . &quot;
&quot; the Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ier of the Ministry of Transport empha@@ sizes inter alia the importance of mobile broad@@ band construction , and one @-@ level sub@@ station to digital radio . &quot;
&quot; at present , a testing of new technology is currently being created on the 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order for the driver to be admitted to the &quot; &quot; No additional terms &quot; , &quot; the federal government will review the legal framework conditions and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Germany wants to employ around international for the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars of 10 to 130 km / hour . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government is also aiming to use the Vienna Convention for amending the Vienna Convention , which has so far only sees the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; when automated driving takes over , the car will take control , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
&quot; the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras , which collect the environment and process the data within seconds . &quot;
&quot; after one of the study presented by the Ministry of Economics , high @-@ automated driving will be technically feasible on motor@@ ways through 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , un@@ ri@@ pped vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected far from 2020 . &quot;
&quot; added value in the area of driver assistance systems and high @-@ automated driving functions in Germany estimate the authors of the study by 2025 to around 8,@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; said the SPD @-@ Transport S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
the question of liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of the driver must be clari@@ fied .
&quot; however , the Germans self @-@ prop@@ elled cars were skep@@ tical - much more than French or American . &quot;
&quot; one on Wednesday at the AA represented survey conducted by the For@@ sa Commission on behalf of the exam@@ for@@ gan@@ isation dec@@ ra comes to the result , that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous vehicles over the next decade to prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe in it at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents through 2025 are expected by aut@@ on@@ om driving cars , in the US 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on their self @-@ driving car . &quot;
&quot; according to a collection of digital stock , Bit@@ k@@ om , only seven percent would agree to take control over the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the highway , that is about 15 per cent conc@@ eive of about 15 percent in the St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
good every fourth would leave the car in no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; according to the present state , the Düsseldorf Congress wants to compete in the championship fight from 25 September to 4 October . &quot;
the final decision should be handed down at the latest on September 22nd .
&quot; that is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough , also without him to pick up the title , &quot; said Finance trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM @-@ cur@@ se in Düsseldorf . &quot;
B@@ oll was at this point on the flight at a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ing event in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are now no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; stated single @-@ European master Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who runs the S@@ etz@@ als in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , rec@@ alled but also reminded of the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; then Timo Schei@@ der had also been missing , and we are a European master . &quot;
&quot; we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; explained the world @-@ list @-@ fifth . &quot;
the English soccer player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United had a serious injury to the right leg .
at the Champions League game at the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven was hit the def@@ ender at a Tac@@ tical of H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno and changed after a lengthy treatment .
the first diagnosis was pointed out at the 20 year old fellow @-@ players from Bas@@ tian &apos;s com@@ ers to a railway level .
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant
it is a mixture of quite a great fashion show and a w@@ ax@@ e hut : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) announced an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights : window man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in , which makes terri@@ fying thanks to vide@@ o@@ projection . &quot;
&quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits the big star of the fashion scene - and thus , that he put men into sk@@ irts . &quot;
&quot; today I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant , the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier it was very light , meanwhile it is real &quot; , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) to be seen from the 18th of September at the Kuns@@ thalle of the HY@@ PO @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion industry would have changed at the beginning of a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; he was actually opposed to it , because : &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit to death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously done in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it is about so much more than just beautiful dres@@ ses , &quot; said the Director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is a question of tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the man &apos;s hardly @-@ looking work of the man , the fashion story has written , without ever completed a training . &quot;
&quot; the presentation does not build the show , but it is an outstanding choreo@@ graphic work machine , for which much effort was operated : to fr@@ ise the doll@@ s , for example , a sty@@ list has been engaged . &quot;
14 tons of stuff made the makers as stated according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to München .
shortly before the start of the October 2007 there was a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a le@@ der@@ less out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are worse than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; s Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
even Gau@@ l@@ ti@@ ers old Ted@@ dy is seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ inian mo@@ unds of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he was attracted to his Ted@@ dy B@@ HS and clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; playing with a d@@ oll , his parents could not have allowed him . &quot;
the dism@@ iss@@ al of fashion he brought himself later on .
&quot; he receives fashion addresses , and saw the dr@@ afts of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich told us . &quot;
&quot; later , I bought it naturally . &quot;
for his first own fashion show he did not pay the Models .
&quot; they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the br@@ isk . &quot;
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as fashion @-@ niche
earlier it went to the long embro@@ ider@@ y machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make meters .
&quot; the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and tips were created in large quantities for customers , for example they have written for blankets and Gar@@ din@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone is no longer working , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , CEO of Mo@@ desp@@ air Pl@@ auen . &quot;
&quot; instead , the fashion is again important . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role , then has then been pushed through the home tex@@ tiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : tip in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and with regional Tra@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called Vintage @-@ fashion , which turned to past bul@@ le@@ - with increasing order @-@ potential . &quot;
who in the textile sector in Germany do not require niche products is no longer the market .
we already have half of all orders .
Mo@@ desp@@ air Pl@@ auen is together with nine more companies member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they are allowed to bear the protected label .
&quot; in the last 15 years , about 80 percent of the turnover was interrupted . &quot;
&quot; private stores and wholesale , there are almost no more . &quot;
our products can hardly reach the customer on this path .
the mass goods now become much cheaper in the Asian region and distributed almost exclusively on chains .
&quot; moreover , the export of exports , up to Russia and the US . &quot;
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association is also trying to score points with environmental awareness , such as Cor@@ du@@ la Bauer was declared by the embro@@ ider@@ y in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; &quot; since this year , we conduct a quality seal , which shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt compl@@ em@@ ented , which refers to the materials used . &quot;
&quot; PhD , U@@ te Schmidt is also teaches at the snow@@ man branch of the West S@@ wick@@ au University of Z@@ wick@@ au . at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Art - and is specialized in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips . &quot;
to continue the competition from the Asian region you need to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the factories , which above all have to think economically . &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design often only varies slightly to keep a customer base . &quot;
a few years ago renowned textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter new the historic snow@@ man tip .
the machine fl@@ es the machine to some places small bowl .
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener gold@@ smith in Bianca Hall@@ eb@@ ah @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ches let itself be inspired , &quot; &quot; before I was able to start with a traditional plex@@ er . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ man tip for their jewelry .
in an elaborate process it shaped the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the topic of &quot; &quot; Pl@@ au@@ ener &quot; &quot; - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also delivers to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors used in their core and surroundings and want to have a reminder . &quot;
so I see my jewelry as a modern amb@@ assador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .
Disney is planning new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; Film
&quot; legends are not allowed to sti@@ r , but Disney w@@ alled to a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , according to &quot; entertainment Weekly &quot; , &quot; however , it is not about a re @-@ fil@@ ement , but a kind of continuation to the 20 years after the first film with the magic child . &quot;
it is about the experience of F@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of world economic crisis in England .
who plays over 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director is already fixed : Rob Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI ur@@ ges the economy to open the economy wide for the world
&quot; the economy must open itself wide to the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was asked with the governance of reform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; China should decide to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the central bank group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; foster new economies and promote reforms , a new momentum and vitality will bring about and bring new space for economic growth , &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regul@@ ating the market access , relaxation of border controls ( SO@@ E ) , private investment ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the population cluster . &quot;
&quot; according to the statement , a negative list is generated , the sectors and companies that do not come into question for investment . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance because it shows the market a greater role in the al@@ location of resources , ensures un@@ constitutional business environment and open the market to the market , &quot; said the statement . &quot;
the government will also hold controls over the powers transferred to the firms and make sure businesses decide how they lead their business .
&quot; the statement also stated that China border regions will allow to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation , and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot;
&quot; to open , public @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services to them , &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it is easy for foreigners to request a permanent residence permit or to request the &quot; Green Card &quot; by the requirements and the application process . &quot;
&quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee their activities , and professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as was reported in a statement which was released after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double cross @-@ border pre@@ amps in pre@@ dat@@ ory
the European Commission wants to double the border values for qu@@ eck@@ ers in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and consumers thus a much higher dose of the neur@@ ons of the nerve .
&quot; the consumer organization Food@@ watch , which is a corresponding working @-@ sp@@ ap@@ ier of the EU , criti@@ ci@@ zed the plans sharp : &quot; risks and side @-@ effects passed into pregnant and inf@@ ants , &quot; stated Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt are said that the threshold values of the nerve ends for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ pen@@ ing or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; &quot; economic reasons &quot; &quot; are raised by one to two milli@@ grams per kil@@ og@@ ram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , big rob@@ bery @-@ fish have already been so strong tied to Mer@@ cury that on the basis of the still current threshold values , about 50 percent of the rose @-@ length can no longer be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling of the threshold values , only 14,@@ 5 percent would be irre@@ ver@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; in return for this relaxation , the EU also wants to exac@@ erb@@ ated the threshold for other fishing from currently 0,5 milli@@ gram to 0.1 mg per kil@@ og@@ ram per kil@@ og@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; but Food@@ watch , this , however , was interpreted as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller cemetery , like about carp , are mostly low stra@@ ined , that they already respect the planned peak levels already today . &quot;
&quot; the retirement in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ denti@@ al bear@@ er that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
Mer@@ cury is a highly toxic even for humans to spread across the food chain especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; the Federal Government is warned that &quot; &quot; I can already cause small amounts of particularly in the bor@@ ns of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Ministry of Environment explains its homepage with regard to current levels of development , however , that an &quot; health threat to the general population does not expect . &quot;
Mer@@ cury is primarily obtained through the coal comb@@ us@@ tion into the environment .
&quot; according to a written information on German coal @-@ power plants , according to a written information by the Federal Ministry of Environment to the Green Parliament , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bock is more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total amount in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish around in El@@ be , Rhein and Danube is &quot; &quot; permanent and surface @-@ stri@@ k@@ ingly &quot; , &quot; had the &quot; mirror &quot; in March on paper c@@ ited . &quot;
last year Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings issued before mer@@ cury in fish is already among the most common health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ system RA@@ SF@@ F .
