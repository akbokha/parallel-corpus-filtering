&quot; III ) Should due to the repeated Wei@@ gh@@ ing of the Community , the designation of Inspec@@ tors of the Organisation to impe@@ de the organisation , the Council of the Organisation - in the following as the &quot; General Director &quot; - is thus concerned with the goal to meet the appropriate measure . &quot;
B ) The community and the affected states under@@ take the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization can actually be er@@ adic@@ ated after their conventi@@ ons .
C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are so established that i ) the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and disturb@@ ance to the Community and the States and for the Inspec@@ tion of civil nuclear activities such as low as possible ;
II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other inspec@@ tors of the organisation is provided for knowledge of the information provided .
&quot; each government turns towards the organization , including their assets , funds and funds , as well as their inspec@@ tors and other officials , the duties for this Convention , the corresponding provisions of the Agreement on the rights and liberation of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; securing measures after this Convention will end in regard to core material when the community and the organization have been dil@@ uted , that the material is consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it has become a nuclear point of securing measures , not more usable or practically not re@@ lu@@ ct@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the community notes from the organization , according to the provisions of this agreement , is the transfer of nuclear material from the states that is subject to the securing measures after this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures after this Convention will end in regard to core material , as soon as the recipient of the recipient , as stated in this Convention , has taken responsibility for the responsibility . &quot;
&quot; the organization takes documents , from which any dis@@ closure and , if necessary , the application of securing measures on the continued core material goes forth . &quot;
&quot; the safety material , the securing measures after this agreement is subject to a non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , will be agreed upon this agreement with the organisation of an such use of the material , under which circumstances can be completed by this agreement on this material . &quot;
II ) that ker@@ material is not used during the duration of non @-@ application of securing measures in accordance with this Convention and other nuclear weapons .
B ) The organization and the community meet a rule out that the securing measures will not be applied for so long as the core material used in such an activity .
&quot; in the regulation , as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances are not applied these securing measures . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the securing measures will be applied once again , as soon as the core material will be brought again to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization will be held over the total amount , and the composition of this in the appropriate state or the relevant states of such a material from this state or from these states out of the current state . &quot;
&quot; this explains its agreement as quickly as possible ; however , it extends to matters such as time @-@ time and proce@@ dur@@ al determin@@ ations of the reporting , but does not exclu@@ de a budget or under secret protection of the military activity and does not refer to the following use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organisation , the community and the states bear the cost of which each of them will increase their obligations under this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the community , the states , or persons who are subject to their territory , however , extraordinary costs due to a special occasion of the organization , so the organisation will be ref@@ unded . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization carries the cost of all additional measurements and sampling that are required by the organization &apos;s inspec@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; the community and states make sure that the liability insurance for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , shall apply to the organisation and their officials for the purposes of implementation of this agreement in the same manner , as in the nationality of states . &quot;
&quot; any claim that the community or a state towards the organisation , or the organisation opposite the community or a state due to damages - with the exception of damage from a nuclear incident - is reflected in accordance with the implementation of securing measures after this Convention , is regulated in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; pursuant to Test of the General Information Security Council , the Council is not able to verify that the organization is not able to verify itself by checking for nuclear weapons or other nuclear spr@@ inkl@@ es , so it may apply in Article X@@ II Section C of the Stat@@ utes , and may also apply the other measures there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council , in which mass was obtained through the applied safety measures , and provides the community or the state - as far as each of the two contra@@ ctual parties - each represented opportunity to grant the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organisation , the community or state , consultations are held on questions that arise from the interpretation or use of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States are entitled to seek that questions , which arise from the design or application of this agreement , are inspec@@ ted by the Council . &quot;
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the coun@@ ters of such questions through the Council .
&quot; with the exception of disp@@ utes ar@@ ising a review of the Council to Article 19 or a Council by the Council , disp@@ utes ar@@ ising from the interpretation or use of the Convention , the Community and the States agreed to under@@ take a Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal , which consists of five arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States also ren@@ ame two arbit@@ rators , the organization also names two arbit@@ rators , and the four so called arbit@@ rators elect a fifth , which ch@@ aired the chair@@ manship . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States , or the organization within three days after the request for an arbit@@ er may not be named as two arbit@@ rators , so the community or the organisation will seek the President of the International Criminal Tribunal for the arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the same procedure is to apply if within three days after the designation or appointment of the fourth Ar@@ bit@@ ration , the fifth Ar@@ bit@@ ration would not have been elected . &quot;
&quot; a majority of members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court is descri@@ b@@ able , and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the resolutions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are binding to the organization , the community and the affected states . &quot;
&quot; a ) This agreement occurs for non @-@ core compet@@ ences , the contra@@ cting party of the Treaty and members of the community are noti@@ fied , in force , i ) when the state of the organization are noti@@ fied that its procedures are concluded for the entry into this agreement . &quot;
&quot; II ) If the community of the organisation was noti@@ fied , that it is able to apply its securing measures in regard to this state for the purposes of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organization , the Community and the States should consult each other , seeking one of the contra@@ ctual parties on a change of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of organization , community and states . &quot;
C ) The Director General teaches all Member States of the Organisation immediately from any change of this Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention enters into force on the day , in which the organisation of the Community and the States receives the written noti@@ fications that their procedures are concluded for entry into force . &quot;
B ) This agreement remains as long as the States Parties to the Treaty of the Treaty .

&quot; purpose of this part of the Convention , which is aimed at implementation of the Sub@@ s I on securing measures as required . &quot;
&quot; the goal of securing measures imposed in this Convention is the right discovery of significant amounts of nuclear weapons for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear spr@@ inkl@@ es for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ rence of such abor@@ tion by the risk of premature discovery . &quot;
&quot; for the purpose of the target in Article 28 , the material accounting will be used as a securing of basic importance , verb@@ al with spatial intervention and observation as an important supplem@@ entary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the examination by the organization takes place by an explanation , in which for each material part zone , which is not shown for a specific period of material , including accuracy of accuracy . &quot;
&quot; when performing their after@@ tests , the organization makes 3 full use of the community &apos;s security system . &quot;
&quot; the audit@@ or and control system of the community for core material , according to this Convention , is based on a breakdown in material areas . &quot;
&quot; in the application of their securing measures , the Community of de procedures and measures will make the following kind of use and , as far as necessary , see how they are determined in the supplem@@ entary evenings and purpose services are : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system for determining the quantities of proven , her@@ al@@ ded , lost , lost , lost or other way out of the inventory and inventory . &quot;
B ) the rating of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurement and estim@@ ation of measurement un@@ certainty ;
&quot; C ) Proce@@ dures for determining , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recei@@ vers ; &quot;
e ) procedures for evaluation of accumulation does not measured inventory and not measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system that covers the core material zone and the changes of these stocks , including one - and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
g ) Pre@@ ferences that make sure the accounting procedures and agreements are correct ;
h ) Proce@@ dures for the refund of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 @-@ 65 and 67 to 69 .
securing measures after this Convention do not extend to material in the mining or of the arch@@ aic .
&quot; B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ erable material , which has not yet reached the phase of the Core combustion cycle , divided into the states so that the community of the organisation will divide the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is intended for specific non @-@ nu@@ kle@@ ar purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) is leaving core material that is suitable for composition and purity of fuel production , or the process phase , which is produced , or will be introduced in the core material or other , in a later phase of the core burning of the kernel , it is subject to the other securing measures in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) In this Convention , the safety measures will not be concluded for core material under Article 11 , but the community is based in Article 11 , which is subject to the recovery of core material , the securing measures after this agreement is not possible or desired , so consult the organisation and community of each other over the application of suitable safety measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) In this Convention , the securing measures will be placed under the requirements for core material under Article 13 , unless the organisation and the community indicate that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ lu@@ ct@@ able . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community , the organisation will exemp@@ t the following core material from the safety measures following this agreement : &quot;
a ) special sp@@ icious material if it is used in grams - or smaller quantities as sensor in instruments ;
B ) core material when it is used in case of non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 if these core material is re@@ cover@@ able and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ onium with a is@@ ot@@ open@@ concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ onium @-@ 238 that is above 80 % .
&quot; on request of the community exemp@@ t the organization &apos;s core material that would otherwise be subject to this agreement , provided by these securing measures , unless the whole , due to this article in the states , free core material quantity is no longer than that . &quot;
a ) a total of kilograms special p@@ iss@@ ile material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lic@@ ing its weight with the en@@ rich@@ ment , &quot;
III ) Ur@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment that lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural uran can be calculated by multip@@ lic@@ ing his weight with the fifth square of en@@ rich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural uran and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an en@@ rich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an en@@ rich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; exemp@@ li@@ fied core material with core material , which is subject to the safety measures after this agreement is subject to processes , processed or stored , thus precau@@ tions are taken to the application of securing measures on that material . &quot;
&quot; the Community meets with the organization of supplem@@ entary do@@ ings that are required in the scope of organising the successful and effective detection of the organisation according to this Convention , in particular , determine the procedures specified in the Convention . &quot;
the supplem@@ entary do@@ ings can be expanded or modified without a change in the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the complem@@ entary do@@ ings simultaneously come together with or as soon as possible after the entry into force . the organization , the community and the States have all efforts to enter into force this agreement within nin@@ ety days ; an extension of this period requires of engagement between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; the organisation is based on the basis of an inventory directory of the entire , securing measures of this agreement in the states , regardless of its origin , and leads to this inventory directory due to the following reports and results of their review . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxemburg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; in ER@@ WA@@ N@@ ING NA@@ CH@@ STE@@ H@@ EN@@ DER Re@@ asons - a ) The EEC has decided to contribute to the conference on international economic cooperation with a low income , whose development is ob@@ struc@@ ted with general resources transfer problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the objective of the EEC and member states that the agreement is bound by the Member States and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do their ability to do so that this goal is achieved . &quot;
D ) The EEC and the organization have cons@@ ul@@ ted each other over the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle bin@@ dings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution in the context of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the EEC has submitted a table from which the organization is confident , in which way they intended to apply the criteria specified in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization aims to create a special account under the name &quot; Special shareholders &quot; , which consists of the Member States to contribute to the special shareholders in accordance with this agreement , the organisation will be determined by the organization as a ste@@ ward . this account will only be specified as &quot; &quot; Administrator &quot; &quot; in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special shareholders will be separated and separated from all other accounts and acti@@ va of the organisation .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is carried out in the form of cash or non @-@ interest school bill , which will pay in the currency of the state in order to pay the organization as a administrator of the special shareholder account and in the establishment of the organization in the public country . &quot;
&quot; B ) The payment is carried out in two rates , namely i ) the first in height of at least 45 v . h . the Beit@@ er within 30 days of entry into force this agreement or to another between the EEC and the ste@@ ward agreed time ; &quot;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of membership fee to 1 January 1979 or at another date , which was agreed between the EEC and the ste@@ ward , taking account of the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval . &quot;
C ) Every member state can afford payments from above the above terminal .
&quot; the car@@ et@@ akers , according to the usual method of organization , takes about proportional circulation to cash or the school bill to cover the expenses for the special implementation and the special shareholder account in appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; with the guarantee of this loan , the car@@ et@@ aker will guide the following factors under the conditions of the EEC . &quot;
&quot; III ) to the extent , in which international economic factors has contributed to the current and fore@@ se@@ eable economic problems of the country ; &quot;
&quot; VI ) of the composition , and the tendency of debt service of the country and its further lending capacity to loan conditions , without limitation ; &quot;
&quot; VII ) The circum@@ ference , where the problems of the relevant countries will regulate , through contributions from other sources . &quot;
&quot; each special transaction is used for financing a clear and fast @-@ pay@@ able development program or fore@@ hab@@ ens ( including a sec@@ toral approval program ) , which is independent , approved and managed to account for those responsible for the organization of organization financed development funds , which is named under letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special shareholder account must not be used instead of regular funds of the International Bank for reconstruction and development ( bank ) or the organization , which already has been approved by the Bank &apos;s direct investment agreement , which has been approved by the bank &apos;s direct investment or the organization . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special provisions submitted to the same back@@ drop conditions , which are generally accepted for the organization of developing countries ; they are thus pay@@ able in ten years in the past 50 years . &quot;
special agreements are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies .
&quot; amounts to the payment of this prayer watch are directly to the organization , which they reserves . &quot;
&quot; each special agreement is characterized by a separate loan agreement between the recei@@ vers and the administrator , in which the origin of the means is specified . &quot;
&quot; the income from any special transaction can be used for issues in the currency of the recei@@ vers or goods or services ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organisation , and which could be granted to measure the administrator at the time of the loan granted , recei@@ vers of a special transaction . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible , as soon as possible , the amount paid in the currency of a member states will be deduc@@ ted as soon as possible from the administrator to the relevant member state . &quot;
the car@@ et@@ akers are taught by the EEC through the directors of the directors through the directors of the directors and the directors approved by the directors approved by the directors and programs .
&quot; during the period of payout of special agreements , the car@@ et@@ akers teaches the EEC in quarterly on the development of the special implementation and the expenses for this . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible , the administrator transfers the EEC as soon as possible after the organization of the organization , a detailed calculation of the special shareholder account with an opinion from external audit@@ or to this account . &quot;
&quot; after full payout of the special agreement , the car@@ et@@ akers of the EEC as soon as possible is possible to provide a detailed report on the account @-@ financed projects and programmes . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ akers created and takes appropriate records and invo@@ ices , from which contributions on the special shareholders , which have been paid for the account and paid out of the account , and withdraw@@ als to the Member States . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together with the goals of this agreement .
&quot; to do this , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the complete issue of funds from time to time to present a thought exchange over the status of the special shareholders &quot; programs or projects , and over all other questions that affect the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is due to an agreement on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date that the EEC and the organisation agreed not into force , the agreement and all of the comm@@ itments of parties agree with immediate effect due to immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; according to Article II Section 8 of the agreement adopted by the recei@@ vers in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement , this agreement and all of the obligations of the parties must be termin@@ ated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires permission by the individual Member States and the EEC according to the legal provisions of each party .
the Member States of the Member States will rati@@ fy the Council of the Council of the European Communities for the conclusion of the procedure .
the Secret@@ ariat will lead these noti@@ fications together with a Not@@ ification on the correct approval of this agreement by the EEC to the organisation .
&quot; this agreement is effective and occurs in force on the first day of the month , which follows on the day of the input of the noti@@ fications noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is made in two origin@@ als in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby each word is equally binding . &quot;
&quot; consider that the agreement in the form of an envelope for the amendment of the App@@ endi@@ x A of the Protocol no . 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , H@@ AT en@@ acted the following VER@@ OR@@ DN@@ ATION : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation on the controlled nuclear fusion and the Plas@@ m@@ aphy@@ si@@ cs
&quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ã@@ IS@@ CHE Atom@@ ic Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Euratom &quot; , represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after , called &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Federal Council called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Federal Council &quot; , &quot;
&quot; this program comprises the creation of a large experiment , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation of a common company called J@@ ET called &quot; Common Companies J@@ ET &quot; - can be transmitted . &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been concerned with research works in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma met@@ aphy@@ si@@ cs and is well familiar with the relevant area . &quot;
&quot; since up to the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion , there are still extensive tasks to summar@@ ize un@@ necessary efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ cuts , and to accelerate their respective research , which have obtained a higher priority stage due to the energy crisis , &quot;
&quot; this agreement should bring any contra@@ ctual party to the situation , to avoid dis@@ closure of their research lab@@ eling in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma processing , according to the common objectives of this research , i.e. the cost @-@ competitive electri@@ fication generation through use of controlled nuclear power handling , faster . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the objectives of the present agreement , the contract parties are associated with their respective app@@ endi@@ x I and II of this agreement defined research programmes , herein@@ after &quot; &quot; Euratom Program &quot; &quot; and &quot; Schweizer Programme . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to ensure an effective collaboration , the Swiss programme has extended the long @-@ term targets and the forms of co @-@ operation of the Euratom program ; it will be extended to examination by Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , where appropriate if new activities are relevant to the Euratom program . &quot;
&quot; every time the contract parties accept a new program , this will take part in the context of or App@@ endi@@ x I and II to the present agreement . &quot;

&quot; - exchange of staff under the governmental laboratories in the Euratom Member States , in Switzerland and in the third @-@ country , with which Euratom has closed a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories which work on the Euratom program ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
&quot; under the target of this agreement , Switzerland took part in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; referring to the implementation of the association Article 2 , 1 of this agreement concluded the association agreement , called &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those who are referred to between the Commission and the States or individuals , below &quot; Associ@@ ated organs , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Euratom program . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Euratom is concerned with the same objective that Switzerland is involved in agreement with the entry of the current agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , below &quot; agreements with personnel exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participating in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the current agreement of the current agreement with the RID Committee of J@@ ET , whose statutes are accepted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Euratom estimates that Switzerland will be contra@@ ctual partner to any contract , except for Associ@@ ations , or other similar contracts , which will be concluded by Euratom during the validity of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the organs , which are appointed with the implementation of the association in Article 2 , 1 of the present association , are described in article 5 to 10 of this agreement and the association agreement . &quot;
&quot; the Association Agreement shall regard the submission of a steering committee , the representative of the Commission and the Federal Council . &quot;
&quot; - to monitor the development of the research work , and to draw so that best results can be achieved in line with the objectives of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; Switzerland is represented by the most two deleg@@ ate in the &quot; &quot; VG &quot; &quot; program in the context of the &quot; &quot; VG &quot; &quot; programme . &quot;
&quot; the VG , which has inform@@ ing the information exchange and cooperation in all questions concerning the current or scheduled programs and activities in the field of the Euratom program , this task refers to this agreement with regard to all research and development activities that this agreement refers to . &quot;
&quot; it is particularly promoting cooperation and co @-@ ordin@@ ation between the associated organs and aimed at investig@@ ating their T * activities in the interest of the two contra@@ ctual parties , as well as in Article 1 of the current agreement as well as related scientific and technological developments . &quot;
&quot; according to its Rules of Rules , the VG , or several Swiss representatives in the context of the Euratom @-@ based advisory groups , will always look for the responsible Swiss authorities . &quot;
&quot; the deliber@@ ations , which provided by the VG research proposals in regard to the Euratom Programme granted the best scientific results , take this task in terms of research and development work to which is taken with regard to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the Euratom Programme , Switzerland is represented by the director of the directors of one of the involved laboratories . &quot;

&quot; I honour me , on the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to the establishment of H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb , and goats from Argentina to the European Economic Community related to the application of common market organisation for sheep - and goat &apos;s meat from the community . during these negotiations the two parties are as follows : &quot;
- fresh or cooled he@@ amm@@ el - lamb - and goat &apos;s meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export options for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat &apos;s meat from Argentina are set to the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in slaughter weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure an imm@@ ac@@ ulate function of the agreement , Argentina is oblig@@ ated to ensure that the amount of quantity must not exceed the agreed amount and executed according to conventional offer ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; if a change of the offer form as a result of changes in technology and trade are possible , the two parties should consult each other before introducing a change in under the number 10 mentioned extension to find an appropriate solution . &quot;

&quot; containers and in@@ fusion devices are provided prior to shipping with an English and French language , which the pattern contained in the systems 2 to 10 are included in this protocol . &quot;
human whole blood can only be sent in containers in which the temperature can be held during transport to 4 C to 6 C .
&quot; in part II this protocol @-@ called preparation and devices must be sterile , ap@@ y@@ che@@ ated and non @-@ toxic . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to add the ship@@ ments to the in@@ fusion , as well as the solvents for dry preparations . &quot;
human whole blood is considered to be a healthy man and mixed blood with an appropriate anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant blood .
C ) that are not free from blood trans@@ fu@@ sions transfer@@ able diseases as far as it can be ensured through simple medical examination and health history .
the blood flow is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is poured into a sterile bottle ( sterile bottle ) in which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans@@ ing solution was introduced before steri@@ li@@ zing .
&quot; after completion of blood flow , the bottle is immediately closed and down to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C , then it may only be opened immediately before using the blood . &quot;
&quot; in terms of volume , the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ inum solution cannot be more than 220 ml per liter of human whole blood , and the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration may not exceed 97 g per liter . &quot;
the blood group after the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system has previously performed on hand of blood cells and power ; the measurement of the R@@ h factor is carried out by investigation of blood cells on a new sample of the dispens@@ er .
&quot; as far as the blood @-@ group determination in individual countries are standardized or recommended procedures , these are to be applied . &quot;
&quot; the designation R@@ h @-@ negative is only to use if specific tests have the non @-@ existing C , D , you and E result . &quot;
&quot; according to this agreement , blood is to be used only for recei@@ vers of the corresponding AB @-@ 0 group . &quot;
&quot; human whole blood is dying in sterile , closed bottle before micro @-@ organisms to keep up to its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are allowed only during testing and transport necessary times , which must be cool immediately on 4 to 6 C . &quot;
a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unity of human whole blood from which the biggest part of the plasma is removed .
&quot; it contains all red blood cells of the unit , which has been won ; other blood cells can be present or can be partially removed . &quot;
&quot; the fluid content of concentrate consists of either of the remaining plasma or a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic wat@@ ery solution , which was added after the Plas@@ mas distance . &quot;
&quot; the volume of red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approximate percentage of the ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes volume ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit ) is used on the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes required for the manufacture required , under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the sealing must be made under pressure , closed system and only by pressure . &quot;
&quot; an artificial irrig@@ ation solution has been added , so on the label also its volume and composition . &quot;
&quot; the human dry plasma is won by de@@ hydr@@ ation of the liquid , which reli@@ es at cent@@ ri@@ fug@@ ation or Se@@ di@@ mentation of human whole blood . &quot;
&quot; the human dry plasma is won by cold drying or any other method , which is avoided by a den@@ d@@ atur@@ ation of the proteins . &quot;
&quot; the dry product can easily dissolve in a water supply , which is equivalent to the fluid level , from which one went to the production of substance . &quot;
the protein concentration of the so gained solution may not be less than 45 g per liter and the solution may not have visible signs of ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis products .
donations in which ( using a fresh sample ) an endangered content of I@@ so@@ h@@ Ã¤m@@ ol@@ ys@@ in or immune hem@@ mag@@ glut@@ ton have been identified .
&quot; unless the plasma is mixed and frozen within 48 hours , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be detected in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to switch the harmful effects of bacterial growth in plasma , blood don@@ ating , the character of a bacterial dist@@ ortion , are not used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be detected in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the risk of transmission of I@@ no@@ cular she@@ ep@@ itis , which are not included in Plas@@ m@@ aber@@ ration mix@@ tures , which do not contain more than 12 donations , or other methods which are known to use this danger in a comparable manner . &quot;
&quot; one of the liquid level , from which one went to the manufacture of plasma , must be added ; the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C . &quot;
&quot; a given quantity of plasma is dissolved in the water supply , which has been produced , which is produced , the solution is subjected to the following tests : &quot;
II ) one sets 1 ml solution a sufficient quantity of thro@@ mb@@ ine or calcium chloride so it takes place in the breeding oven at 37 C .
&quot; due to the 24 @-@ step drying process in the presence of phosph@@ orous carbon dioxide under a pressure of maximum 0,@@ 02 mm mercury may not occur in the human dry @-@ loss loss over 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; human dry plasma is placed in an embroi@@ dery atmosphere or an air @-@ empty space in a sterile , closed bottle under exclusion of any micro@@ organisms and to make any moisture content ; it is before light to protect and keep at a temperature below 20 C . &quot;
&quot; human alb@@ um@@ in and fra@@ ctions from human plasma rot@@ ein are preparations from the protein component , consisting of about 60 % of the total protein mass of the plasma protein . &quot;
&quot; without regard to whether the final product should be flu@@ essi@@ g or dry , the preparation according to the addition of a suitable stabili@@ zer in the ultimate container must be heated to 60 C Â± 0.5 C in order to in@@ activate the path@@ ogen of the I@@ no@@ cular she@@ ep@@ itis . &quot;
in preparation from human Alb@@ um@@ in must be at least 95 % of the mass of existing proteins .
&quot; in both cases , no more than 10 mg of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ulin G may be present per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; the final product is dried up , so it must contain at least 950 mg protein per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; the group is manufactured from human plasma proteins as a solution , so it must have a total protein concentration between 45 and 50 g per liter . &quot;
&quot; human Alb@@ um@@ in is used as a solution , so it must have a total protein concentration of at least 45 g per liter . &quot;
&quot; compar@@ measurements of viscosity and dr@@ ink@@ ers , as well as cent@@ ri@@ fug@@ ing with the ultra@@ cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and electro@@ ly@@ sis , which are made before and after heating to the solutions , no signs of den@@ oting the dissolved proteins may be revealed . &quot;
&quot; after heating up to 57 C and six @-@ tier cont@@ ag@@ ings in a mechanical bulk unit , the solution must be completely free from visible par@@ particles . &quot;
I ) The maturity tests with specific ant@@ is@@ era have to show that in both preparations are only human plasma proteins ;
&quot; II ) the elec@@ trop@@ ho@@ res@@ is represented by fre@@ ech@@ we@@ ary particles of an@@ tic@@ able and appropriate conditions , must show that the flexibility of the Alb@@ umin@@ component of normal human plasma possesses , in preparation of human plasma proteins , at least 95 % of the protein mass amounts to at least 85 % of the protein mass . &quot;

&quot; in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the anti@@ gen D , the serum is supposed to react to the possibility of blood cells , the Do @-@ anti@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ D Sera , who are intended to use lenses according to the test for Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , have to be mixed with an equal amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ percent reduction of C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells at about 40 Â° C , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completely dissolved within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ C serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people affected by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system immune system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with impact of human red blood cells containing the anti@@ gen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C @-@ anti@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; therefore , these are therefore specifically intended for the C @-@ anti@@ gen , if the tested blood cells are w@@ asted in a 0,@@ 9@@ percent cook@@ ery solution . &quot;
the Tit@@ er of the Anti @-@ C Sera ( complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ cd@@ de@@ e blood cells .
